as consideration for the sale, transfer, conveyance and assignment of the

(i) deliver to the Sellers (or one or more of their designees) one or more
wire transfers of immediately available funds to the wire transfer address or

assume the Assumed Liabilities; and (b) after the Closing, deliver to the
Sellers (or one or more of their designees) any Earnout Amount payable to the
Sellers subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth
on Exhibit A hereto. The Closing Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment
as set forth in Section 2.4 and shall be paid to each Seller at the Closing in
a manner consistent with the Initial Closing Date Allocation. At the Closing,
the Sellers shall pay out of the proceeds from the Closing Purchase Price an
aggregate amount equal to $2,500,000, allocated evenly among the Management

Section 2.2 Allocation of Purchase Price.

(a) Buyer and the Sellers agree that all amounts properly treated as purchase
price for the Purchased Entities and the Purchased Assets for U.S. federal
income tax purposes initially shall be allocated among each of the Purchased
Entities and the Purchased Assets in accordance with the allocation set forth
on Section 2.2 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the "Initial Closing Date Allocation"). As soon as practicable, and in any event
not later than ninety (90) days after the determination of the Closing
Statement pursuant to Section 2.4, the Sellers shall provide to Buyer (i) an
allocation of any post-Closing adjustments described in Section 2.4 among the
Purchased Entities and the Purchased Assets in an appropriate and equitable
manner and (ii) an allocation of all amounts that were allocated pursuant to
the Initial Closing Date Allocation, as adjusted by the allocation described
in clause (i) of this sentence, to the Purchased Assets and any Purchased
Entity that is classified as an entity disregarded as separate from any Seller
for U.S. federal income tax purposes among each Purchased Asset and the assets
owned by each such Purchased Entity, respectively, in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (clauses (i) and
(ii), collectively, the "Proposed Allocation"). In the event that Buyer
objects to the Proposed Allocation in writing within thirty (30) days of
receipt of such Proposed Allocation, the Sellers and Buyer shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Sellers and Buyer fail to agree on
such allocation within thirty (30) days following Buyer's written objection,
such allocation shall be determined, within a reasonable time, by the
Arbitrating Accountants. The allocation, as agreed upon by the Sellers and
Buyer (either because Buyer does not object in writing to the Proposed
Allocation or as a result of good faith negotiations between the Sellers and
Buyer) or determined by the Arbitrating Accountants under this Section 2.2
(the "Final Allocation"), shall be final and binding upon the Parties and each
of the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear all
fees and costs incurred by it in connection with the determination of the
Final Allocation, except that the Parties shall pay the fees and expenses of
the Arbitrating Accountants in accordance with Section 2.5. The Final
Allocation shall be subsequently amended as required by applicable Law to
reflect any adjustments (including pursuant to Section 8.11) to any amounts
properly treated as purchase price for the Purchased Entities and Purchased
Assets after the date the Final Allocation is completed in a manner consistent
with the Final Allocation and as otherwise agreed to among the Parties.

(b) Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall prepare and file, and cause its
Affiliates to prepare and file, its Tax Returns (including IRS Form 8594) on a
basis consistent with the Final Allocation. The Sellers and Buyer shall not
take any Tax position inconsistent with the Final Allocation; provided,
however, that nothing contained herein shall prevent any Party or its
Affiliates from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any
Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Final Allocation, and
no Party hereto or its Affiliates shall be required to litigate before any
court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental Authority
challenging the Final Allocation, in each case, subject to the provisions set
forth in Section 8.4.

Section 2.3 Estimated Closing Statement. Not less than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a
statement setting forth its good faith calculation and estimate of the
Adjustment Amount ("Estimated Adjustment Amount"), including (i) a calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Net
Working Capital (and the Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount),
(ii) a calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Cash, (iii) a calculation of
the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness and (iv) a calculation of the
Estimated Closing Date Transaction Expenses (the "Estimated Closing
Statement"). The calculations and estimate referred to in clause (i) through
(iv) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be calculated on a basis
consistent with GAAP, and using the same accounting practices, policies,
judgments and methodologies (including with respect to reserves and revenue
recognition) used in the preparation of the Financial Statements and in the
calculation of the NWC Target ("Applicable Accounting Principles").
Illustrative examples showing the calculations required to prepare the
Estimated Closing Statement are set forth in Section 2.3 of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule ("Sample Statement").

Section 2.4 Post-Closing Adjustments.

(a) Closing Statement. On or prior to the date that is sixty (60) days
following the Closing, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Sellers a
statement setting forth the Adjustment Amount, including (i) a calculation of
the Net Working Capital of the Business as of the close of business on the
Closing Date ("Closing Date Net Working Capital") (and a calculation of the
Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount), (ii) a calculation of the Cash of the
Purchased Entities as of the close of business on the Closing Date ("Closing
Date Cash"), (iii) a calculation of the Indebtedness of the Purchased Entities
or securing any of the Purchased Assets as of the close of business on the
Closing Date ("Closing Date Indebtedness") and (iv) a calculation of the
Transaction Expenses of the Purchased Entities as of the close of business on
the Closing Date ("Closing Date Transaction Expenses") (the "Closing
Statement"). The Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
Sample Statement and the Applicable Accounting Principles and otherwise in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement.

(b) Review Period. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt by the Sellers of
the Closing Statement, the Sellers may deliver written notice (the "Protest
Notice") to the Buyer of any objections, specifying in reasonable detail any
contested amounts and the basis therefor which the Sellers may have to the
Closing Statement. The failure of the Sellers to deliver such Protest Notice
within the prescribed time period will constitute the Sellers' acceptance as
final of the Closing Statement as determined by the Buyer. Any amounts not
disputed in the Protest Notice (if one is delivered) shall be deemed to be
accepted by the Sellers as final. Upon receipt of the Closing Statement, the
Sellers and their representatives will be given reasonable access to the
Buyer's relevant books, records, workpapers and personnel during reasonable
business hours for the purpose of verifying the Closing Statement.

(c) Disputes. If the Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve any disagreement
with respect to the Closing Statement within thirty (30) days following
Buyer's receipt of a Protest Notice, then the Parties shall mutually retain the Arbitrating
Accountants and refer solely the items and amounts in dispute to the
Arbitrating Accountants for final determination within forty-five (45) days
after such referral. Any determination by the Arbitrating Accountants shall
not be outside the range defined by the respective amounts in the Closing
Statement proposed by the Sellers and Buyer, and such determination shall be
final, binding and non-appealable upon the Parties. Each of the Sellers and
the Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the
Arbitrating Accountants in their determination of the amounts set forth in the
Closing Statement.

(d) Adjustment Amount. The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or
negative, shall mean zero:

(i) plus the Net Working Capital Adjustment Amount (which may be positive or
negative);

(ii) plus the Closing Date Cash;

(iii) minus the Closing Date Indebtedness; and

(iv) minus the Closing Date Transaction Expenses.

If the Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.4
exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount (the amount of such excess, an "Excess
Amount"), the Closing Purchase Price shall be increased by such Excess Amount,
and if the Adjustment Amount as finally determined pursuant to this Section
2.4 is less than the Estimated Adjustment Amount (the amount of such
shortfall, a "Shortfall Amount"), the Closing Purchase Price shall be
decreased by such Shortfall Amount. The Excess Amount or Shortfall Amount
shall be paid in accordance with Section 2.4(e).

(e) Payment. Within five (5) Business Days of the final determination of the
Adjustment Amount pursuant to this Section 2.4, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account designated by the recipient:

(i) if there is an Excess Amount, Buyer shall pay to the Sellers an amount
equal to the Excess Amount; and

(ii) if there is a Shortfall Amount, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount
equal to the Shortfall Amount.

Section 2.5 Withholding. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise deliverable to any Person in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement any amounts that Buyer and its Affiliates are required to
deduct and withhold under applicable Law; provided, however, that (i) with
respect to deductions or withholdings of the Closing Purchase Price paid by
Buyer at Closing, such deductions or withholdings shall be made in accordance
with the principles set forth on Section 2.5 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) with respect to all other deductions or withholdings, Buyer
shall, not fewer than five (5) days prior to making such deduction or
withholding, provide written notice to such Person in respect of which Buyer
believes it is required to make any such deduction and withholding, which
written notice shall identify the applicable Law requiring such deduction and
withholding; provided, further, that Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with
such Person to reduce or eliminate, or to claim any refund of, any such
deduction and withholding, in each case to the extent permitted by Law
(including reasonably cooperating with such Person to complete any applicable
exemption forms, the delivery of which would reduce or eliminate any such
withholding), in each case, at such Person's expense. Any such deducted and
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

Section 2.6 Arbitrating Accountants. The "Arbitrating Accountants" shall be an
internationally recognized accounting firm with no connection to Buyer or the
Sellers to be agreed upon by the Parties. The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountants shall be allocated between the Parties in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of disputed items that were determined in
favor of the other Party or Parties (as finally determined by the Arbitrating
Accountants) bears to the total amount of disputed items submitted by the
Parties.

ENTITIES

Except as set forth in the disclosure schedule delivered to Buyer by the

relevance of the information in question is reasonably apparent on the face of
such other section or subsection), the Sellers hereby represent and warrant to
Buyer as of the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as follows:

as amended as of the date hereof, have been made available to Buyer. Each of
the Sellers has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into,

and delivery of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by each of the
Sellers, the performance by each of the Sellers of their respective
obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by each of the
Sellers of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly
authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of each of the

rights, restricted stock units or similar rights in the Interests or other
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of
capital stock (or applicable membership interests) of the Purchased Entities,

obligations of the Sellers or their respective Affiliates issue or sell
additional shares of capital stock (or applicable membership interests) of the
Purchased Entities or to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Interests

rights, phantom stock ownership interests or similar rights in the Purchased
Entities. There are no voting agreements, stockholders agreements, management

or grant any right, preference or privilege with respect to the transfer of
the Interests, and there are no options outstanding to acquire the Interests.

to be material to the Purchased Entities, the Purchased Assets or the
Business.

performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements by the Sellers, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby by the
Sellers and the Purchased Entities, do not and shall not require any Consent

Property constitutes all of the real estate assets, rights, properties and
services necessary to operate its business in all material respects as it is
currently conducted.

Section 4.8 Intellectual Property.

valid right to use, all of the Intellectual Property included in the Purchased
Assets, which, along with the rights to be provided under Section 6.5 and the
services and assets to be provided under any Ancillary Agreement, constitute
all of the Intellectual Property that is necessary for the conduct of the
Business as currently conducted in all material respects; provided, however,
for avoidance of doubt, the foregoing and the representation shall not be

code form; (ii) materially limits the freedom to seek full compensation in
connection with marketing, licensing and distributing such applications to

Section 6.2 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Sellers shall: (i)
afford Buyer and its authorized representatives reasonable access to the
properties and Books, Records and Files of the Business and (ii) furnish to
the officers, directors, employees, and authorized representatives of Buyer
such additional financial and operating data and other information regarding
the Business (or copies thereof) as Buyer may from time to time reasonably
request; provided, however, that any such access or furnishing of information
shall be scheduled and coordinated and shall be conducted at Buyer's expense,
during normal business hours, under the supervision of the Sellers' or their
Affiliates' personnel and in such a manner as not to interfere with the normal
operations of the Business or any of the Excluded Businesses. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers shall not be required
to disclose any information to Buyer if the Sellers reasonably and in good
faith determine that such disclosure would (x) cause competitive harm to the
Business or any of the Excluded Businesses if the transactions contemplated
hereby are not consummated, (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or (z) contravene any fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof.

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing, at which time such Confidentiality Agreement and
the obligations of Buyer under this Section 6.2(b) shall terminate; provided,
however, that from and after the Closing, except as would have been permitted
under the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties shall, and shall
cause their respective officers, directors, employees, authorized
representatives and Affiliates to, refrain from using for any purpose, treat
and hold as confidential, and not disclose to any Person, information related
to the discussions and negotiations between the Parties regarding this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and all confidential
information relating to (i) the Sellers and the Excluded Businesses (in the
case of Buyer and its respective officers, directors, employees, authorized
representatives and Affiliates) and (ii) Buyer, the Purchased Entities and the
Business (in the case of the Sellers and their respective officers, directors,
employees, authorized representatives and Affiliates); provided, further, that
Huron may, without the consent of Buyer, communicate with its shareholders and
lenders, respond to inquiries, issue releases and make such disclosures as it
considers reasonably necessary and appropriate. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect.

(c) Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any Information (as such term is
defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) provided to the other Party or its
Affiliates pursuant to Section 6.2(a) or otherwise by or on behalf of the
providing Party or any officer, director, employee or authorized
representative of such Party shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.3 Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents.

(a) Upon the terms and conditions hereof each of the Parties shall, and shall
cause its controlled Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as promptly as practicable all material Consents of any Governmental
Authority required in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including, without limitation, by (i) filing,
or causing to be filed, any Notification and Report Form and related material
required under the HSR Act as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of
this Agreement but, in any event, unless specifically agreed otherwise by the
Sellers and Buyer, no later than ten (10) calendar days after the date of this
Agreement, and by using its commercially reasonable efforts to be able to
certify, and to certify, as soon as reasonably practicable, its substantial
compliance with any such requests for additional information or documentary
material that may be made under the HSR Act, unless the Sellers and Buyer
mutually determine that it is reasonable under the circumstances not to comply
substantially with any requests for additional information and documentary material under the HSR Act and furnishing, or
causing to be furnished, to each other all information required for any
filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and notice, other than
confidential or proprietary information not directly related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and keeping the other Parties
reasonably informed with respect to the status of each clearance, approval or
waiver sought from a Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the material communications
between such Party and such Governmental Authority; (ii) not acquiring or
agreeing to acquire (and not permitting any controlled Affiliate to acquire or
agree to acquire) any business, Person or division thereof, or otherwise
acquiring or agreeing to acquire any assets if the entering into of a
definitive agreement relating to or the consummation of such acquisition could
reasonably be expected to materially increase the risk of not obtaining the
applicable clearance, approval or waiver from any Governmental Authority with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iii) generally
taking, or causing to be taken, all other actions necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade
regulation Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing
to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and in any event no later than the
Termination Date; provided, however, that in no case shall the Parties be
required to pay any fees or other payments to any such Governmental
Authorities in order to obtain any such Consent (other than normal filing fees
that are imposed by Law).

(b) Each of the Sellers and Buyer shall, without limitation: (i) promptly
notify the other of, and if in writing, furnish the other with copies of (or,
in the case of oral communications, advise the other of) any communications
from or with any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with,
any proposed written or any oral communication with any such Governmental
Authority; (iii) not participate in any meeting or have any communication with
any such Governmental Authority unless it has given the other an opportunity
to consult with it in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate therein; and (iv) furnish the other Party with copies of all
filings and communications between it (or its advisors) and any such
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

Section 6.4 Books, Records and Files. Buyer and the Sellers agree that the
Sellers may maintain copies of any Books, Records and Files that are included
in the Purchased Assets and the Purchased Entities. Buyer agrees to retain and
maintain such Books, Records and Files related to the Purchased Assets and the
Purchased Entities for a period of at least seven (7) years after Closing
(plus any additional time during which Buyer has been advised by the Sellers
that (i) there is an ongoing Tax audit with respect to periods prior to the
Closing or (ii) any such period is otherwise open to assessment; provided that only such Books, Records
and Files related to the appropriate Tax audit or period as advised by the
Sellers shall be subject to such time extension). During such period, Buyer
agrees to give the Sellers and their representatives reasonable cooperation,
access (including copies) and staff assistance, as needed, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice, with respect to the Books, Records
and Files delivered to Buyer hereunder, and the Sellers agree to give Buyer
and its representatives reasonable cooperation, access and staff assistance,
as needed, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, with
respect to the Books, Records and Files relating to the Business and retained
by Sellers, in each case as may be necessary for general business purposes,
including the defense of litigation, the preparation of Tax Returns and
financial statements and the management and handling of Tax audits; provided
that such cooperation, access and assistance does not unreasonably disrupt the
normal operations of Buyer or the Sellers or their respective Affiliates.

Section 6.5 Intellectual Property Matters.

(a) As soon as practicable and in no event later than ten (10) Business Days
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause each of the Purchased Entities to
amend its organizational documents, and any trade names, D/B/As or the like,
to change its corporate names and trade names to corporate names and trade
names that do not include any Excluded Names or any Trademark confusingly
similar thereto. Following the Closing, Buyer shall cause the Purchased
Entities to (i) no later than three (3) months following the Closing Date,
cease to make any use of or to authorize any third party to make any use of
any Excluded Names or any Trademarks confusingly similar thereto (except as
permitted by this Section 6.5(a)) and (ii) no later than twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date, to remove, strike over, or otherwise obliterate
all Excluded Names from all existing assets and other existing materials of
the Purchased Entities, including any vehicles, business cards, schedules,
stationery, packaging materials, displays, signs, promotional materials,
manuals, forms, websites, email, computer software and other materials and
systems (provided that following the three (3) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not create any new assets or materials using the
Excluded Names (except as permitted by this Section 6.5(a)). Any use by the
Purchased Entities of any of the Excluded Names as permitted in this Section
6.5 is subject to their use of the Excluded Names in a form and manner, and
with standards of quality, of that in effect for the Excluded Names as of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.5(a),
Buyer shall not be in violation of this Section 6.5(a) by reason of: (x) the
appearance of the Excluded Names in or on any written materials or assets of
the Purchased Entities or the Business that are used for internal purposes
only (provided that Buyer uses commercially reasonable efforts to remove such
appearances of the Excluded Names); (y) the appearance of the Excluded Names
in or on any third party's publications, marketing materials, brochures,
instruction sheets, equipment or products that the Sellers or any of their
Affiliates distributed in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
or pursuant to a Contract prior to the Closing, and that generally are in the
public domain, or any other similar uses by any such third party over which
Buyer and the Purchased Entities have no control; or (z) the non-prominent use
by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of the Excluded Names in an accurate and
non-trademark manner solely for purposes of conveying to customers or the
general public that ownership of the Purchased Entities or the Business has
changed.

(b) During the two (2) year period following the Closing Date, if (i) Buyer
identifies in writing to the Sellers any Intellectual Property (excluding
Trademarks) owned by the Sellers and their Affiliates that was used in and
necessary for the conduct of the Business as of the Closing and was not
included in the Purchased Assets, owned by the Purchased Entities or provided
to the Purchased Entities under the Transition Services Agreement, or (ii) the
Sellers identify in writing to Buyer any Intellectual Property (excluding
Trademarks) included in the Purchased Assets or owned by the Purchased
Entities that was used in and necessary for the conduct of the Excluded
Businesses as of the Closing, then the Party receiving such notice shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to grant to the other Party a perpetual,
royalty-free, sublicenseable license to use such Intellectual Property in the
conduct of the Business (with respect to Buyer, if Buyer so requests such
license) or the Excluded Businesses (with respect to the Sellers, if the
Sellers so request such license). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary,
Buyer and the Sellers agree that, unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
(x) the rights under any license with respect to any Intellectual Property
described in clause (i) of this Section 6.5(b) shall be treated as a Purchased
Asset under this Agreement, (y) the Purchased Asset relating to any license
described in clause (ii) of this Section 6.5(b) shall be treated as having
been purchased by Buyer and sold by the applicable Seller on the Closing Date
subject to such license and (z) neither any Party nor any of its Affiliates
shall take any position inconsistent with the treatment described in this
sentence.

Section 6.6 RandW Insurance. Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
purchase the RandW Insurance Policy, and shall be responsible for the premium
and for all other costs of procuring the RandW Insurance Policy. The Sellers
shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to assist Buyer in obtaining
the RandW Insurance Policy, except that the Sellers (prior to or following the
Closing) shall not be required to incur any expenses associated therewith.

Section 6.7 Bulk Sales Law. The Buyer hereby waives compliance by the Sellers
or the Purchased Entities or any of their respective Affiliates with any
applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer laws of any jurisdiction in connection
with the sale of the Purchased Assets and the Interests to the Buyer.

Section 6.8 Publicity. The Parties shall not (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates not to) issue any press release or make any other public statement
with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Purchase
Price, except as required by Law or the rules of any stock exchange (in which
case the Party will, to the extent practicable under the circumstances,
provide the other Party with reasonable prior notice and a reasonable
opportunity to review in advance and comment on the disclosure); provided that
nothing in this Section 6.8 shall prohibit the Parties from making disclosures
to their respective professional advisors, auditors, financing sources,
prospective financing sources, Affiliates, funds and other investment entities
managed by such Party or its Affiliates or limited partners or investors in
any fund or investment entity managed by such part or its Affiliates;
provided, further, that Huron may, without the consent of Buyer, communicate
with its shareholders and lenders, respond to inquiries, issue releases and
make such disclosures as it considers reasonably necessary and appropriate.

Section 6.9 Disclosure Schedule Updates. From time to time prior to the
Closing, the Sellers may supplement or amend the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
solely with respect to (i) any Material Contracts entered into or other
actions taken by the Sellers between the date hereof and the Closing Date not
in violation of Section 6.1 for the purpose of supplementing or updating
Section 4.7(a), Section 4.8(a) or Section 4.9(a) of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule and (ii) any actions taken by the Sellers between the date hereof and
the Closing Date that are consented to in writing by Buyer. Any such
supplement or amendment of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule shall not give rise
to any right of Buyer to terminate this Agreement; provided that such
supplement or amendment shall not impair Buyer's right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 12.1(d). Any supplement or amendment hereunder
shall be provided to the Buyer not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date.

Section 6.10 Further Action.

(a) Following the Closing, each of the Parties hereto shall, and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, to do or cause to be done
all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law and the
agreements included in the Purchased Assets or the Interests, and to execute
and deliver such documents and other papers and any other agreements, as may
be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and to effect the separation of the Purchased Assets and the
Interests from other assets of the Sellers, including, to the extent
reasonably practicable, to obtain all required Consents from third parties.
Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of any amounts necessary to obtain
any required Consents from third parties.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense or otherwise
provide rights with respect to any Purchased Asset or the Interests or any right
thereunder if an attempted assignment, license or other provision, without the
Consent of, or other action by, any third party, would constitute a breach or
other contravention of a Contract with such third party or would in any way
adversely affect the rights of the Parties or any of their respective
Affiliates relating to such Purchased Assets or the Interests. To the extent
that any of the transfers, distributions, licenses, deliveries and the
assumptions required to be made in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been so consummated at Closing,
the Parties shall cooperate and use their commercially reasonable efforts to
effect such consummation as promptly thereafter as reasonably practicable,
including executing and delivering such further instruments of transfer and
taking such other actions as the Parties may reasonably request in order to
effectuate the purposes of this Agreement or to more effectively transfer to
Buyer or confirm Buyer's right, title to or interest in, all of the Purchased
Assets and the Interests, to put Buyer in actual possession and operating
control thereof and to permit Buyer to exercise all rights with respect
thereto (including rights under Contracts and other arrangements as to which
the Consent of any third party to the transfer thereof shall not have
previously been obtained). In the event and to the extent that the Sellers and
Buyer are unable to obtain any required Consents, the Sellers shall, to the
extent practicable using commercially reasonable efforts, (i) at the direction
and expense of Buyer, pay, perform and discharge fully all of its obligations
thereunder from and after the Closing and prior to assignment to Buyer and
(ii) without further consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to Buyer
promptly all monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of
such agreements. If Buyer is so provided the benefits of any such Contract,
Buyer shall assume the liabilities of the Sellers arising out of such
Contract, for the benefit of the Sellers. The Sellers shall exercise or
exploit its rights and options under all such agreements, Leases, licenses and
other rights and commitments when and only as reasonably directed by Buyer. If
and when any such Consent shall be obtained (the cost of obtaining any such
Consent, if any, shall be borne by Buyer) or such agreement, Lease, license or
other right shall otherwise become assignable or sublicenseable, the Sellers
shall promptly assign or sublicense its agreed-to rights and obligations
thereunder to Buyer without payment of further consideration and Buyer shall,
without the payment of any further consideration therefor, assume such rights
and obligations.

(c) In the event that the Parties determine that certain assets, rights or
properties which properly constitute Purchased Assets or Interests were not
transferred to Buyer at Closing, the Sellers shall promptly take all steps
reasonably necessary to transfer and deliver any and all of such assets to
Buyer without the payment by Buyer of any further consideration therefor. In
the event that the Parties determine that certain Excluded Assets were
transferred to Buyer at Closing, then Buyer shall promptly take all steps
reasonably necessary to transfer and deliver any and all of such Excluded
Assets to the Sellers without the payment by the Sellers of any further
consideration therefor. (d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Sellers and Buyer
shall work diligently and in good faith toward the execution of the Ancillary
Agreements with such terms and conditions required pursuant hereto and such
other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the Parties. If any
Ancillary Agreement is not finalized prior to the Closing, the Sellers and
Buyer shall continue to work diligently and in good faith after the Closing
toward the execution of such Ancillary Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the Closing with such terms and conditions required pursuant hereto
and such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the Parties.

Section 6.11 Contact with Customers and Other Business Relations. During the
period from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the Closing or
(b) the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Buyer
shall not (and shall not permit any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents, representatives and Affiliates to) contact any employee of the
Sellers, customers, vendors or other material business relations of the
Business regarding the Business or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the Sellers (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 6.12 Intercompany Debts. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Sellers shall take, or cause to be taken, in a commercially
reasonable tax-efficient manner, such action as may be necessary such that,
(a) as of the Closing Date, there shall be no intercompany obligations
(including intercompany payables or receivables) between the Purchased
Entities, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than
the Purchased Entities), on the other hand, except with respect to the
Transition Services Agreement and (b) as of the Closing Date, there shall be
no intercompany obligations (including intercompany payables or receivables)
among the Purchased Entities that could reasonably be expected to result in
adverse Tax consequences to the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Purchased Entities) after the Closing.

Section 6.13 Termination of Affiliate Contracts. Except as set forth on
Section 6.13 of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, effective at the Closing, the
Sellers shall cause all of the Affiliate Contracts to be terminated without
any termination fees payable by the Purchased Entities or any costs or other
Liability assessed to Buyer or its Affiliates thereunder (including the
Purchased Entities); provided that the foregoing shall not affect the services
to be provided pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and the payments
to be made thereunder.

Section 6.14 Non-Competition. For a period of five (5) years from and after
the Closing, each Seller agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause its
Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, engage in any Competitive Business,
including by holding any equity or debt securities in any Person engaged in
such activities; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.14 shall
prohibit the Sellers or any of their Affiliates from (a) conducting the
Excluded Businesses as they are presently being conducted or have plans to be conducted
as of the date hereof, (b) owning up to ten percent (10%) of the voting power
or equity interests of any Person that is engaged in any Competitive Business,
so long as none of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates actively manages any
such Person or otherwise actively takes any part in any of its businesses,
other than exercising its rights as a shareholder, or (c) acquiring, in one
transaction or a series of transactions, by purchase of stock or assets,
merger, consolidation or otherwise, the whole or any part of any Person that
carries on a Competitive Business if the revenue of such Person or business so
acquired attributable to the Competitive Business did not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of such Person's or business' total revenue for the most recently
completed fiscal year preceding such transaction (provided that following such
purchase, merger, consolidation or other transaction, the acquiring Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to divest any Competitive Business
conducted by such Person within six (6) months thereafter if the revenue of
such Person or business so acquired attributable to the Competitive Business
exceeds $8,000,000 for the most recently completed fiscal year preceding such
transaction). Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, in
the event any Seller divests all or any portion of its business in an asset
sale to any third party the prohibitions in this Section 6.14 shall not apply
to such portion or such business so divested and to any such third party.

Section 6.15 Non-Solicitation. For a period of five (5) years from and after
the Closing Date, each Seller agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to, without the express prior written consent of Buyer,
directly or indirectly, hire or solicit any Transferred Business Employees to
leave the employment of Buyer or any of its Affiliates for employment with the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, or violate the terms of their employment
contracts, or any employment arrangements, with Buyer or any such Affiliate of
Buyer; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 6.15 shall prohibit the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates from, or hiring any person as a result of,
(a) making generalized searches for employees by the use of advertisements in
the media (including trade media) or by engaging search firms or employment
agencies that are not instructed to solicit the Transferred Business Employees
or (b) soliciting any Transferred Business Employee whose employment by Buyer
or any of its Affiliates has been terminated three (3) months prior to the
commencement of discussions with the soliciting party.

Section 6.16 Release. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, and its and their successors and
assigns, and all Persons who at any time prior to the Closing were
stockholders, directors, officers, agents or employees of such Seller or its
Affiliates (in each case, in their respective capacities as such), hereby
generally, irrevocably and completely waives, releases, acquits, relinquishes
and forever discharges Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Entities) and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, affiliates,
employees, advisors and agents from and against any and all claims, demands,
damages, debts, Liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses (including
attorneys' and accountants' fees and expenses), Actions and causes of action,
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, both at law and in equity, that such Seller now has, or at any
time previously had, or shall or may have in the future, against the Purchased
Entities or involving the Purchased Assets, which arise out of or pertain to
any claims such Person has or may have as an equityholder, or former
equityholder, of any of the Purchased Entities, for matters existing or
occurring on or prior to the Closing Date, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, on or after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the release
set forth in this Section 6.16 shall not affect (i) any rights to
indemnification to which a Buyer Indemnitee may be entitled pursuant to the
terms of (and subject to the limitations set forth in) Article X and (ii) any
claims made pursuant to Section 13.13.

Section 6.17 Insurance Coverage. The Sellers shall maintain (or cause to be
maintained) the Insurance Arrangements until the Closing. Following the
Closing, the Sellers shall maintain (or cause to be maintained) the Insurance
Arrangements that are occurrence-based solely with respect to claims that were
made or Losses that occurred or were suffered prior to the Closing (the
"Maintained Coverage"). Except for the Maintained Coverage, Buyer acknowledges
and agrees that all Insurance Arrangements as they relate to the Purchased
Assets or the Purchased Entities shall terminate as of the Closing. If any
claims are made or Losses occur or are suffered prior to the Closing, then
such claims, or claims in respect of such Losses, may be made against the
Maintained Coverage, and the Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that, after the Closing Date, Buyer can file, notice and
otherwise continue to pursue such claims and seek to have proceeds paid
pursuant to the terms of such Maintained Coverage. The Sellers agree to
otherwise cooperate with Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Purchased
Entities) to make the coverage benefits of any Maintained Coverage available
to Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities), at the cost and
expense of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities).

Section 6.18 Release of Letters of Credit and Guarantees. As of the Closing,
Buyer (i) shall either (A) obtain a substitute guaranty, indemnity agreement
or similar instrument to replace in all respects each Guarantee or (B) fully
assume all obligations under each such Guarantee and (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain from the creditor or beneficiary of each such
Guarantee and deliver to the Sellers a full and unconditional release of all
of the obligations of the Sellers and their applicable Affiliates under each
such Guarantee (which release shall be reasonably acceptable to the Sellers).
In the event Buyer was unable, as of the Closing, to obtain substitute
guarantees, indemnity agreements or similar instruments to replace in all
respects the Guarantees (or assumed all obligations thereunder) and obtain and
deliver releases with respect thereto in accordance with the preceding
sentence, Buyer shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to do so
following the Closing and shall (1) indemnify and hold harmless each of the
Sellers and their Affiliates from and against any and all Losses incurred by
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates arising out or relating to such
Guarantees on or after the Closing Date in respect of actions or events
occurring or conditions existing, in each case, following the Closing and (2) not permit the Purchased Entities or their
Affiliates to (x) renew or extend the term of, (y) increase the obligations
under, or (z) transfer to another third party, any loan, lease, Contract or
other obligation for which the Sellers or any of their Affiliates is or would
reasonably be expected to be liable under such Guarantees. To the extent that
the Sellers or any of their Affiliates have performance obligations under any
such Guarantee that arise or relate to actions or events that occur on or
after the Closing Date, Buyer shall (I) perform such obligations on behalf of
the Sellers or such Affiliates or (II) otherwise take such action as
reasonably requested by the Sellers so as to put such the Sellers or such
Affiliates in the same position as if Buyer, and not such the Sellers or such
Affiliates, had performed or was performing such obligations.

Section 6.19 2015 Bonuses; Bonus Pool Amount. The Sellers shall pay 2015
bonuses on the Closing to the employees set forth on Section 6.19 of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the "Management Employees"), which total in the
aggregate $1,150,000. The Sellers have approved 2015 bonuses for the Business
Employees (and any Inactive Business Employees) but excluding the Management
Employees up to an aggregate amount of $3,201,883 (such maximum aggregate
amount, the "Bonus Pool Amount"). Pursuant to Section 3.4, at the Closing the
Sellers shall cause the Bonus Pool Amount to be deposited with the Escrow
Agent to be held and distributed according to the Bonus Pool Escrow Agreement
and this Section 6.19. No later than two (2) days before the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall provide Buyer with a list of each Business Employee's (and any
Inactive Business Employee's) individual allocation of the Bonus Pool Amount
(the "Bonus Pool Breakdown"). The Management Employees shall not be named in
the Bonus Pool Breakdown and shall not receive any Bonus Pool Amount. In
accordance with the Bonus Pool Escrow Agreement, individual allocations of the
Bonus Pool Amount shall be paid by Buyer to Transferred Business Employees on
or prior to March 15, 2016, based on the Bonus Pool Breakdown and the
eligibility criteria set forth in Section 6.19 of the Sellers Disclosure
Schedule. Any portion of the Bonus Pool Amount not paid by Buyer to eligible
Transferred Business Employees shall be returned to the Sellers pursuant to
the Bonus Pool Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, other than the
payment of individual allocations of the Bonus Pool Amount to eligible
Transferred Business Employees in accordance with this Section 6.19, Buyer
shall not have any obligation to pay any amount with respect to any 2015 bonus
to any Business Employee (including any Inactive Business Employee or
Management Employee).

ARTICLE VII 

EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 7.1 Employment. (a) No later than ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
Buyer shall, or shall have caused one of its Affiliates to, offer employment,
on the terms set forth in this Article VII, to employees of the Sellers
(exclusively related to the Business), including employees who are (i)
actively at work or on paid time off, with employment effective at 12:00 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time on the day immediately following the Closing Date, and
(ii) on long-term disability, short-term disability or workers' compensation,
or on a leave of absence, whether paid or unpaid, approved by the Sellers or
otherwise required by applicable Law (collectively, "Inactive Business
Employees"), with employment effective as of the date such Inactive Business
Employee returns to active employment with the Sellers; provided, that such
date is no later than the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing Date or
such later date required by applicable Law (such employees in clauses (i) and
(ii), together with the employees of the Purchased Entities, but excluding the
employees of the Sellers or Purchased Entities listed on Section 7.1(a) of the
Sellers Disclosure Schedule (the "Excluded Employees"), the "Business
Employees"). Those Business Employees who accept such offers of employment (or
whose employment transfers automatically pursuant to applicable Laws) and
become employees of Buyer and its Affiliates upon the Closing (or, in the case
of Inactive Business Employees, on a later date in accordance with this
Section 7.1(a)) shall thereafter be referred to as the "Transferred Business
Employees."

(b) Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing for twelve (12) consecutive
months thereafter, Buyer shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates
to provide each Transferred Business Employee with (i) a base salary or base
wages that are no less favorable than the base salary or base wages provided
to such Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
all other compensation and employee benefits (other than any equity-based
compensation, change in control or other transaction-based payments or any
other incentive compensation other than annual bonuses, benefits under any
defined benefit plans and any retiree health or welfare benefits) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to those that are provided to such
Transferred Business Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (iii)
the applicable payment in respect of the Bonus Pool Amount. Notwithstanding
anything in this Section 7.1(b) to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement
shall (i) after the Closing Date, impose on Buyer any obligation to retain any
Transferred Business Employee in its employment or prevent Buyer from
amending, modifying or terminating any of its employee benefit plans or
arrangements following the Closing, or (ii) impose on the Sellers any
obligation to retain any Business Employee in its employment or prevent the

Transferred Business Employee shall cease to be an active participant under
the Employee Benefit Plans that are not assumed by Buyer and its Affiliates,
in accordance with the terms of such Employee Benefit Plans. As of 12:00 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time on the day immediately following the Closing Date, and
without limiting the covenants in Section 7.1, the Transferred Business
Employees shall be entitled to participate in the employee benefit plans and
arrangements maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the
Transferred Business Employees (each, a "Buyer Benefit Plan") on the same
terms as similarly situated employees of Buyer or its Affiliates, including,
if applicable, health, life, accident and group insurance and short-term and
long-term disability benefits, subject to any applicable employee cost, in
each case, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plans and applicable Law.

(b) For all purposes under each Buyer Benefit Plans (including, without
limitation, for purposes of eligibility and accrual and vesting of benefits

fully credited, to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plans and applicable Law, with his or her respective periods of
service with the Sellers or the Purchased Entities before the Closing, to the
same extent as such Transferred Business Employee was entitled, immediately
prior to the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Employee
Benefit Plan; provided, however, that in no event shall such credit result in
the duplication of benefits. In addition, Buyer shall waive, or shall cause to
be waived, any limitations or waiting periods as to pre-existing conditions,
restrictions or exclusions for Transferred Business Employees and their
eligible dependents under each Buyer Benefit Plan providing for health,
medical, dental, vision and other similar benefits, to the extent such
condition for such Transferred Business Employee and his or her eligible
dependents was covered under a similar Employee Benefit Plan and shall credit
the Transferred Business Employees and their eligible dependents for any
customary deductibles, co-payments, out of pocket maximums and the like, paid
by them under such similar Employee Benefit Plan prior to the date of
commencement of participation in such Buyer Benefit Plan during the year in
which such commencement occurs in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-
payment, out-of-pocket or similar requirements under such Buyer Benefit Plan,
in each case, to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Buyer shall waive any
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Transferred Business Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after
the Closing under any Buyer Benefit Plan, in each case to the extent such
Transferred Business Employee or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar
limitation or requirement under a similar Employee Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing and to the extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Buyer
Benefit Plan and applicable Law. (c) To the extent mutually agreed to by the Parties prior to the Closing,
following the Closing Date and subject to Revenue Ruling 2002-32, the Sellers
and the Purchased Entities shall cause the portion of any Employee Benefit
Plan that is a flexible reimbursement plan applicable to the Transferred
Business Employees to be segregated into a separate component, and all account
balances and salary reduction elections of the Transferred Business Employees
in any such flexible reimbursement plan shall be transferred to a Buyer
Benefit Plan that is a flexible reimbursement plan that Buyer shall, or shall
cause any of its Affiliates to, maintain during the period mutually agreed to
by the Parties, in accordance with the terms of such Buyer Benefit Plan and
applicable Law.

(d) From and following the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates shall retain and
be responsible for, as Assumed Liabilities (and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers, the Purchased Entities and their respective Affiliates from
and against) any and all Liabilities and obligations, with respect to
Transferred Business Employees which relate to events that occur following the
Closing Date for any employee pension, welfare, fringe or incentive
compensation, severance, retention, transaction or other similar payments that
may become payable following the Closing Date under any Buyer Benefit Plan,
including in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (either alone or in combination with any other event) to the extent
such Liabilities and obligations are assumed by Buyer or its Affiliates
pursuant to this Article VII.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) Buyer
shall, promptly upon the receipt of an invoice from Sellers accompanied by
reasonable documentation of the costs set forth therein, reimburse the Sellers
for the costs incurred by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates at any
time in respect of events that occur or claims that are incurred following the
Closing by the Transferred Business Employees (or their eligible
beneficiaries) under any Employee Benefit Plan which is a Welfare Plan and
(ii) the Sellers shall, promptly upon the receipt of an invoice from Buyer
accompanied by reasonable documentation of the costs set forth therein,
reimburse Buyer for the costs incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates at any time
in respect of events that occur or claims that are incurred prior to the
Closing by the Transferred Business Employees (or their eligible
beneficiaries) under any Buyer Benefit Plan (for the avoidance of doubt, costs
are "incurred" by the Sellers or their respective Affiliates for purposes of
Employee Benefit Plans or by Buyer or its Affiliates for purposes of Buyer
Benefit Plans on the date on which the event occurs or service is rendered, as
applicable, and not at the time an invoice is presented for payment).

Section 7.3 Defined Contribution Plans. As of immediately prior to the
Closing, each Transferred Business Employee shall cease to participate in each
Employee Benefit Plan that is a Defined Contribution Plan (each "Sellers
401(k) Plan"). Following the Closing Date, each Transferred Business Employee
shall be permitted to elect a distribution (in accordance with the terms of the applicable Sellers 401(k) Plan) of his or her account balance in
the Sellers 401(k) Plan and also shall be permitted (in accordance with the
terms of such Sellers 401(k) Plan) to roll over his or her account balances in
such plan to a Buyer Benefit Plan which is a Defined Contribution Plan (a
"Buyer 401(k) Plan"), including the ability to roll over any existing loans
under such Sellers 401(k) Plan, for at least ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date. The Sellers and Buyer shall take all actions necessary or
appropriate, and shall cooperate with each other to accomplish and facilitate
the foregoing, and, following the Closing Date, Buyer shall be solely
responsible for obtaining any employees' elections with respect to each Buyer
401(k) Plan, to the extent not obtained prior to the Closing, regarding the
roll-over of account balances, including loans, subject to Sellers'
cooperation, as reasonably requested by Buyer.

Section 7.4 Compliance with WARN. With respect to the Transferred Business
Employees, Buyer shall have full responsibility under the WARN Act relating to
any plant closing or mass layoff occurring after the Closing Date, subject to
Sellers' obligation to provide Buyer at or prior to the Closing with an
accurate list of layoffs, by location, during the ninety (90) day period
immediately prior to the Closing.

Section 7.5 Workers' Compensation Claims.

(a) Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay any and all workers'
compensation and other similar statutory claims which relate to events that
occur with respect to any Transferred Business Employees after the Closing
Date.

(b) Sellers shall be responsible for and shall pay any and all workers'
compensation and other similar statutory claims (i) which relate to events
that occur with respect to any Business Employee on or before the Closing
Date, and (ii) provided that Buyer complies with its obligations under Section
7.1, which relate to events that occur to Business Employees who do not become
Transferred Business Employees after the Closing Date.

Purchased Entities with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period ending on or before
Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"); (ii) any Taxes for which any Purchased Entity is liable under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
under any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), as transferee or
successor, by Contract or otherwise, in each case, (x) with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period or (y) by reason of being a member of a consolidated,
affiliated, combined or other group for Tax purposes, entering into a Contract
or any other action taken at any time before the Closing; (iii) Taxes arising
from any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Sellers in
Section 4.16 of this Agreement (provided, that solely with respect to the
calculation of the Losses (and not for purposes of determining breach) arising
out of or related to any such inaccuracy or breach, in each case, any
qualifier in any such representation or warranty as to materiality, Material
Adverse Effect or words of similar import shall be disregarded); (iv) Taxes
arising from any breach by any Seller of any covenant contained in this
Agreement; (v) any withholding Taxes imposed in connection with the

pursuant to Section 2.5 of this Agreement, (vi) any amount required to be
included by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities
after the Closing Date) in income under Section 951(a) of the Code with
respect to a Purchased Entity to the extent such inclusion is attributable to
a Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Purchased Entity (the amount of such
inclusion to be determined using a closing of the books method) and (vii)
Excluded Taxes. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the amount of any
Losses subject to a claim for indemnification under this Section 8.1(a) shall
not be subject to, and shall not be included in the calculation of the
limitations set forth in Section 10.3, other than Section 10.3(b)(iv).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Buyer
Indemnitees shall not have the right to indemnification under this Agreement
for any Taxes that are based on or relate to Taxes: (A) that result from
Buyer's breach of any of the covenants contained in this Article VIII or (B)
to the extent such Taxes were included as a liability in the determination of
Closing Date Net Working Capital. For purposes of this Section 8.1(a),
references to "Losses" and "Taxes" shall be deemed to include amounts that
would have constituted "Losses" or "Taxes" but for the set-off or other
utilization of any loss, deduction, credit or other Tax asset attributable to
any Post-Closing Tax Period. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, this Section 8.1(a) shall survive the Closing until the ninetieth
(90th) day after the expiration of the statute of limitations period
applicable thereto.

(b) Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall indemnify and hold the Sellers
Indemnitees harmless from and against (i) any Taxes attributable to or imposed
on the Purchased Assets with respect to any taxable period beginning after the
Closing Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date (a "Post-Closing Tax Period"), and (ii) Transfer Taxes borne by
Buyer pursuant to Section 8.3; provided, that notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be responsible for and shall not
indemnify and hold the Sellers Indemnitees harmless from and against any Taxes
described in this Section 8.1(b) to the extent that Buyer and its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Purchased Entities) are entitled to indemnification or reimbursement from the Sellers for such Taxes
pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Section 8.5.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, in the case of Taxes that are payable with
respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any such Taxes that is allocable
to the portion of the period ending on (and including) the Closing Date shall
be: (i) in the case of any ad valorem or property Taxes, deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a fraction
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
Straddle Period that ends on (and includes) the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, be deemed to equal the amount
which would be payable if the relevant taxable period ended at the end of the
day on the Closing Date.

(d) Whenever in accordance with this Article VIII the Sellers shall be
required to pay Buyer an amount pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or Buyer shall be
required to pay the Sellers an amount pursuant to Section 8.1(b), such
payments shall be made the later of thirty (30) days after such payments are
requested or ten (10) days before the requesting Party is required to pay the
related Tax liability.

Section 8.2 Tax Returns.

(a) The Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause
to be filed all Tax Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets or the
Purchased Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a Straddle
Period). All such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice, unless otherwise required by Law. The Sellers shall provide
Buyer with a copy of any such Tax Return that is required to be filed by a
Purchased Entity after the Closing Date at least thirty (30) days prior to the
last date (giving effect to any valid extensions thereof) for timely filing
such Tax Return (or such shorter period as is reasonable taking into account
the applicable taxable period, due date and Taxes) for Buyer's review, comment
and approval. The Sellers shall incorporate all reasonable comments provided
by Buyer with respect to such Tax Returns. To the extent necessary to comply
with applicable Law, Buyer shall execute or cause to be executed and file or
cause to be filed any such Tax Return as prepared by Sellers. Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and shall file or cause to be filed all Tax
Returns with respect to the Purchased Assets and the Purchased Entities for
all Straddle Periods that are required to be filed after the Closing Date;
provided that such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice, unless otherwise required by Law. Before filing any Tax Return
with respect to any Straddle Period, Buyer shall provide the Sellers with a
copy of such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to the last date
(giving effect to any valid extensions thereof) for timely filing such Tax
Return (or such shorter period as is reasonable taking into account the
applicable taxable period, due date and Taxes) accompanied by a statement calculating in reasonable detail Sellers' indemnification
obligation, if any, pursuant to Section 8.1(a). Buyer shall incorporate all
reasonable comments provided by Sellers with respect to such Tax Returns to
the extent such comments relate to Taxes for which the Sellers are liable
pursuant to this Agreement. If for any reason the Sellers do not agree with
Buyer's calculation of its indemnification obligation, the Sellers shall
notify Buyer of its disagreement within fifteen (15) Business Days of
receiving a copy of the Tax Return and Buyer's calculation (or such shorter
period as is reasonably requested by Buyer taking into account the applicable
taxable period, due date and Taxes). If the Parties are unable to resolve any
dispute prior to the due date of such Tax Return (giving effect to valid
extensions), Buyer shall file the Tax Return as originally prepared (but,
reflecting any items on which the Parties have agreed) and shall later amend
such Tax Return if necessary following the resolution of such dispute pursuant
to the method set forth in Section 8.6. If the Sellers agree with Buyer's
calculation of its indemnification obligation, the Sellers shall pay to Buyer
the amount of the Sellers' indemnification at the time specified in Section
8.1(d).

(b) Unless otherwise required by Law, Buyer shall not (and shall not cause or
permit the Purchased Entities to) amend, refile or otherwise modify any Tax
Return relating to the Purchased Entities with respect to any taxable period
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
the Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

Section 8.3 Transfer Taxes.

(a) All Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes incurred in connection
with, or as a consequence of the transfer of the Purchased Assets or the
Interests shall be timely filed by the party responsible for such filing under
applicable Law and, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, all such Transfer Taxes (and all reasonable out-of-pocket costs for
preparation of such Tax Returns) shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer
and fifty percent (50%) by the Sellers. Buyer and the Sellers shall reasonably
cooperate to reduce or eliminate any Transfer Taxes to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. If the Sellers pay a Transfer Tax at the Closing or pursuant
to a post-Closing assessment by any Tax Authority, Buyer will reimburse the
Sellers for fifty percent (50%) of the amount of such Transfer Tax within
thirty (30) days of the Sellers' written demand therefor. If Buyer pays a
Transfer Tax at the Closing or pursuant to a post-Closing assessment by any
Tax Authority, Sellers will reimburse Buyer for fifty (50%) of the amount of
such Transfer Tax within thirty (30) days of the Buyer's written demand
therefor.

(b) All amounts payable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement shall be exclusive
of any applicable VAT properly chargeable to Buyer. Buyer shall pay any VAT
properly chargeable to Buyer in respect of such amounts within ten (10) days of receipt
by Buyer of a valid VAT invoice.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) to the
extent any Transfer Taxes or VAT are recoverable or refundable to either the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, on the other hand, such Party shall be responsible for the payment
of one hundred percent (100%) of such Transfer Taxes or VAT and (ii) to the
extent any Transfer Taxes or VAT are required under applicable Law to be paid
by a Party to the applicable Governmental Authority in order for such Transfer
Taxes or VAT to be recoverable or refundable by such Party or otherwise
credited against the applicable Transfer Tax or VAT liability of such Party
under applicable Law, such Party shall pay such Transfer Taxes to the
applicable Governmental Authority and the non-paying Party that is otherwise
responsible for any portion of such Transfer Taxes or VAT pursuant to this
Section 8.3 shall remit its portion of such Transfer Taxes or VAT to the Party
required to pay the applicable Governmental Authority no later than five (5)
Business Days before the filing of the related Tax Return.

Section 8.4 Tax Claims.

(a) If an Action for Taxes (including notice of a pending audit) shall be made
in writing by any Tax Authority, which, if successful, could result in an
indemnity payment from Sellers pursuant to Section 8.1(a) or otherwise affect
an item for which Sellers would be entitled to a payment pursuant to Section
8.5 (a "Tax Claim"), the party first receiving written notice of such Tax
Claim shall notify the other party within fifteen (15) Business Days of the
receipt of such a Tax Claim. A failure by any Party to provide proper notice
of a Tax Claim shall not relieve such Party from its indemnification
obligations under this Agreement, except to the extent that the other Party is
actually and materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

(b) In the case of any Tax Claim that relates solely to any taxable period
that ends on or prior to the Closing Date, the Sellers may assume the defense
of such Tax Claim by providing written notice to Buyer within fifteen (15)
days of the receipt of the notice required under Section 8.4(a). Subject to
Section 8.4(d), Buyer may, at its own expense, fully participate in any such
Tax Claim and the Sellers shall not settle or otherwise dispose of such Tax
Claim without obtaining Buyer's prior written consent, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If the Sellers do not assume
the defense of any such Tax Claim, Buyer shall defend such Tax Claim (at the
expense of Sellers) and shall not settle or otherwise dispose of such Tax
Claim without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. (c) Except as provided in Section 8.4(b) and Section 8.4(d), Buyer shall
control all Tax Claims; provided that (i) Buyer shall keep the Sellers
informed regarding the progress and substantive aspects of any issues in such
Tax Claim for which the Sellers may have liability pursuant to this Agreement
or be entitled to a payment pursuant to Section 8.5, (ii) the Sellers shall be
entitled to participate in such Tax Claim with respect to any issues for which
the Sellers may have liability pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) Buyer
shall not settle or otherwise dispose of any issues in such Tax Claim for
which the Sellers may have liability pursuant to this Agreement, without
obtaining the Sellers' prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be entitled to participate in any Tax Claim relating to any
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return that includes the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates.

Section 8.5 Refunds.

(a) Sellers shall be entitled to any Tax refunds (including any interest in
respect thereof paid by a Tax Authority) that are received by Buyer or the
Purchased Entities and any amounts credited against Tax that are actually
realized by Buyer or the Purchased Entities, in each case, that (i) are
attributable to the Purchased Assets for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or (ii)
relate to the Purchased Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period in each case,
with respect to Taxes that Sellers paid prior to the Closing Date or for which
Sellers have indemnified Buyer and its Affiliates pursuant to Section 8.1(a);
provided that Sellers shall not be entitled to any such Tax refunds or credits
(x) if and to the extent such Tax refunds or credits were included as a
current asset in determining Closing Date Net Working Capital or (y) that
arise from the carryback of any Tax attribute generated in any Post-Closing
Tax Period. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Purchased Entities to pay to the
Sellers the amount of any such refund or credit within fifteen (15) days after
receipt of such refund or, in the case of such a credit, within fifteen (15)
days after filing the Tax Return upon which such credit was actually utilized
to reduce Taxes otherwise payable with respect to such Tax Return, in each
case, net of any Taxes, cost or expenses incurred by Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with obtaining such Tax refund or credit that were
not previously reimbursed by Sellers pursuant to Section 8.5(b). Sellers shall
reimburse Buyer for any Tax refund or credit (plus any penalties, interest and
other charges imposed by the relevant Tax Authority) in the event Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Purchased Entities) are required to repay
such Tax refund or credit to any Tax Authority.

(b) Buyer shall take commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate, and cause
the Purchased Entities to cooperate, in obtaining any refund that the Sellers
reasonably believe should be available, including through filing appropriate
amended Tax Returns with the applicable Tax Authorities. Any reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses incurred by Buyer or the Purchased Entities in connection with such activities shall be reimbursed by
the Sellers within fifteen (15) days of written notice by Buyer of such
expense.

Section 8.6 Resolution of All Tax Related Disputes. Except as otherwise
provided with respect to any dispute or a disagreement relating to Taxes
between the Parties, the Parties shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such
dispute between them; but if the Parties are unable to resolve such dispute,
the Parties shall submit the dispute to the Arbitrating Accountants for
resolution, which resolution shall be final, conclusive and binding on the
Parties. The fees and expenses relating to any dispute as to the amount of
Taxes owed by either of the Parties shall be shared equally by the Sellers and
Buyer.

Section 8.7 Cooperation, Exchange of Information and Record Retention.

(a) Sellers and Buyer shall provide each other, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives reasonably to provide each other, with such cooperation and
information relating to the Purchased Entities as any of them reasonably may
request of another, including in (i) preparing and filing any Tax Return or
claim for refund, including maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in connection with Taxes; (ii) resolving all disputes and
audits with respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes; (iii) contesting
or compromising any Tax Claim; (iv) determining a Tax liability or a right to
a refund of Taxes; (v) participating in or conducting any audit or other
proceeding in respect of Taxes; and (vi) connection with all other matters
covered in this Article VIII. Each such party shall make its employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide explanations of any
documents or information provided hereunder.

(b) Sellers and Buyer recognize that the Sellers will need access from time to
time after the Closing Date to certain accounting and Tax records and
information held by the Purchased Entities to the extent such records and
information pertain to events occurring on or prior to the Closing Date;
therefore, the Sellers and Buyer agree that from and after the Closing Date,
Sellers, Buyer, and their respective Affiliates shall (i) retain and maintain
all such records including all Tax Returns, schedules and work papers, records
and other documents in their possession relating to Tax matters of the
Purchased Entities for taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date
and for the Straddle Period for the longer of (x) the seven (7)-year period
beginning on the Closing Date or (y) the full period of the applicable statute
of limitations, including any extension thereof and (ii) allow the agents and
representatives of each other, upon reasonable notice and at mutually
convenient times to inspect, review and make copies of such records (at the
expense of the party requesting the records) as the Sellers and Buyer may deem
reasonably necessary or appropriate from time to time. The Sellers and Buyer
agree that the holder of any records, books, workpapers, reports,
correspondence and other similar materials shall provide the other Party with
written notice thirty (30) calendar days prior to transferring, destroying or discarding the last copy of any such materials and such other
Party shall have the right, at its expense, to copy or take any such
materials; provided that such other Party provide written notice stating its
intent to copy or take such materials no later than twenty (20) days after
having received notice that such materials are being transferred, destroyed or
discarded. Any information obtained under this Section 8.7(b) shall be kept
confidential except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

(c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
Buyer shall not be entitled to any information, whether in connection with the
preparation and filing of Tax Returns, any Tax proceeding, or otherwise
relating to any consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary Tax Return which
includes the Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates, except for any
such information (including separate pro forma Tax Returns or other similar
information) relating solely to any Purchased Entity or the Purchased Assets.

Section 8.8 Tax Benefits. Any indemnity payments made pursuant to this
Agreement shall be made net of any Tax Benefit actually realized by the
recipient as a result of incurring the indemnified Loss or indemnified Tax,
other than any Tax Benefit resulting from any Loss or indemnified Tax relating
to the Purchased Assets or any Purchased Entity that is disregarded as
separate from its owner for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Section 8.9 Tax Sharing Agreements. Any and all existing Tax Sharing
Agreements to which any of the Purchased Entities are a party shall be
terminated on or prior to the Closing Date solely with respect to such
Purchased Entity. After the Closing Date, such Purchased Entity shall have no
further rights or obligations under any such Tax Sharing Agreement.

Section 8.10 Section 338. Following the Closing Buyer and its Affiliates shall
make a valid and timely election under Section 338(g) of the Code, and any
corresponding election under state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to
each of the Foreign Purchased Entities (a "Section 338 Election").

Section 8.11 Conflict and Survival. The covenants and agreements of the
Parties set forth in this Article VIII shall survive until ninety (90) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations for the
relevant Pre-Closing Tax Period (giving effect to valid extensions). This
Article VIII shall exclusively govern all indemnification claims with respect
to Taxes.

Section 8.12 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. For all Tax purposes,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law, any payment by Buyer or the
Sellers under this Article VIII or Article X shall be treated as an adjustment
to the Purchase Price. ARTICLE IX

under Section 10.1 (other than with respect to Taxes) or Section 10.2:

(i) unless the Indemnified Party has given the Indemnifying Party a Claim
Notice or Indemnity Notice, as applicable, with respect to such claim, setting
forth in reasonable detail the specific facts and circumstances pertaining
thereto, as soon as practical following the time at which the Indemnified
Party discovered, or reasonably should have discovered, such claim (except to
the extent the Indemnifying Party is not materially prejudiced by any delay in
the delivery of such notice) and, in any event, prior to the date on which the applicable representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement ceases to survive pursuant to Section 9.1 or Section 9.2;

(ii) to the extent such amount was taken into account in calculating the
Adjustment Amount (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.4);

(iii) to the extent any matter forming the basis for such Loss was (A)
reflected or reserved for on the Financial Statements or (B) taken into
account in calculating the Estimated Closing Statement or Closing Statement,
and no Losses related thereto shall be aggregated for purposes of Section
10.3(b)(ii) or Section 10.3(b)(iii); or

(iv) to the extent it asserts a claim for consequential, incidental, indirect,
exemplary or punitive damages; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
"Losses" shall include (i) consequential, incidental, indirect, exemplary or
punitive damages, in each case, that are the natural, probable and reasonably
foreseeable result of the circumstance causing such Losses and (ii) any
damages for which an Indemnified Party is found liable to a third party in
respect of a Third Party Claim.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
indemnity obligations of the Sellers under this Article X shall be further
limited as set forth in this Section 10.3(b):

(i) no indemnity shall be payable by the Sellers under Section 10.1(a) (other
than for any inaccuracy or breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.16 (Taxes)) with
respect to any individual claim for Losses that does not exceed 0.125% of the
Purchase Price (the "Minimum Amount");

(ii) with respect to individual Losses that are in excess of the Minimum
Amount (the "Covered Losses"), no indemnity shall be payable by the Sellers
under Section 10.1(a) (other than for any inaccuracy or breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations or the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.16 (Taxes)) until the aggregate of such Covered Losses exceeds 0.50%
of the Purchase Price (the "Basket") and then only for such Covered Losses in
excess of the Basket;

(iii) the Sellers shall have no further indemnity obligations under Section
10.1(a) (other than for any inaccuracy or breach of any of the Fundamental
Representations or the representations and warranties set forth in Section
4.16 (Taxes)) once the aggregate of all Covered Losses paid by it equals 1.0%
of the Purchase Price; and (iv) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for which the Sellers
are obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 10.1 (other
than Section 10.1(d)) or Section 8.1(a) exceed an amount equal to the Purchase
Price.

(c) In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought under this
Article X, the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate any Losses upon becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be
expected to give rise thereto, including but not limited to using commercially
reasonable efforts to recover under a policy of insurance or under a
contractual right of set-off or indemnity.

Section 10.4 Claims for Indemnification. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this Section
10.4:

(a) Third Party Claims. In the event that any written claim or demand for
which an Indemnifying Party may be liable to any Indemnified Party hereunder
is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a
third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later than
fifteen (15) days following such Indemnified Party's receipt of such claim or
demand (including a copy of any related written third party demand, claim or
complaint) (the "Third Party Claim"), deliver a Claim Notice to the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its
obligations to indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third
Party Claim if the Indemnified Party fails to timely deliver the Claim Notice
and the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. If a Third Party
Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
shall wish, to assume the defense thereof with counsel of its own choosing if
(i) the Indemnifying Party acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the
Indemnified Party and it gives notice of its intention to assume the defense
thereof with counsel of its own choosing within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of such Claim Notice from the Indemnified Party (provided, however,
that the Indemnifying Party's retention of counsel shall be subject to the
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (ii) the Third Party Claim
does not seek injunctive relief against an Indemnified Party, (iii) the
Indemnifying Party does not fail to conduct the defense of the Third Party
Claim and (iv) (A) there does not exist a material conflict of interest
between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party in the conduct of
such defense and (B) there are not material defenses available to the
Indemnified Party that are not available to the Indemnifying Party. After
notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of such election
to so assume the defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable
to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof. The Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in the defense against any such Third Party
Claim. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of any Third Party Claim.
Neither the Indemnifying Party, on the one hand, nor the Indemnified Party, on
the other hand, shall admit liability to, or settle, compromise or discharge
any Third Party Claim without the prior consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided,
however, the Indemnifying Party may settle, compromise or discharge any Third
Party Claim, the defense of which was assumed by the Indemnifying Party if
such settlement, compromise or discharge provides only for the payment of
monetary damages by the Indemnifying Party and a full and unconditional
release of the Indemnified Party, which would have no liability thereunder. In
the event the Indemnifying Party elects not to defend any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnified Party shall defend against such Third Party Claim in good
faith and in a commercially reasonable manner at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to
participate in such defense at its own expense.

(b) Direct Claims. In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
under Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 against any Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall promptly deliver
an Indemnity Notice to the Indemnifying Party.

Section 10.5 Insurance Offset. If any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party
are covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or
similar obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such
Indemnified Party), the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or
similar payments. If the Indemnified Party actually receives such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments prior to being
indemnified, held harmless and reimbursed under Section 10.1 or Section 10.2,
as applicable, with respect to such Losses, the payment by an Indemnifying
Party under this Article X with respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the
net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar
payments actually received to the extent related to such Losses, less
reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in connection with such
recovery. If the Indemnified Party actually receives such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after being indemnified and
held harmless by an Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, the
Indemnified Party shall pay to the Indemnifying Party the net amount of such
insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payment actually
received to the extent related to such Losses, less reasonable attorney's fees
and other expenses incurred in connection with such recovery.

Section 10.6 Exclusivity. After the Closing, the indemnities set forth in this
Article X shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties, their
successors and assigns, and their respective officers, managers or directors,
employees, agents, members and Affiliates with respect to this Agreement, the
events giving rise to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except (a) for claims grounded in fraud and (b) as
provided in Section 6.2 (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.18
(Release of Letters of Credit and Guarantees), Article VIII (Taxes) and
Section 13.13 (Specific Performance). The Parties shall not be entitled to a
rescission of this Agreement or to any further indemnification rights or
claims of any nature whatsoever in respect hereof (whether by Contract, Law or
otherwise, all of which the Parties hereby waive), except in the case of
fraud.

on or prior to March 31, 2016 (the "Termination Date") or such later date as
the Parties may agree upon in writing; provided, however, that if the sole
reason that the Closing has not occurred is that the approvals required

Termination Date, the Termination Date may be extended by either the Sellers
or Buyer to a date not beyond April 30, 2016; provided, further, that the

obligation, representation or warranty of the Sellers hereunder, and such

result in the failure of a condition set forth in Section 11.2 or Section

Section 13.3 Waiver. Neither any failure nor any delay by any Party in
exercising any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the
documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such
right, power or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or privilege will preclude any other or
further exercise of such right, power or privilege.

Section 13.4 Entire Agreement and Modification. This Agreement (together with
the Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes hereto), the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement supersede all prior agreements, whether written or
oral, between the Parties with respect to its subject matter and constitutes
(along with the Schedules, Exhibits and other documents delivered pursuant to
this Agreement) a complete and exclusive statement of the terms of the
agreement between the Parties with respect to its subject matter. This
Agreement may not be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except by a
written agreement executed by the Parties.

Section 13.5 Binding Effect; Assignments. The rights and obligations of this
Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing expressed or implied
herein shall be construed to give any other Person any legal or equitable
rights hereunder. Except as expressly provided herein, the rights and
obligations of this Agreement may not be assigned or delegated by any Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, Buyer may, upon reasonable advance notice to the Sellers,
(i) assign to any one or more of its Affiliates, any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part (provided, that (a) such
assignees deliver an instrument in writing to Sellers confirming that it or
they are bound by and shall perform all of the obligations of the Buyer under

hereunder shall relieve Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement and
Buyer shall cause such assignees to perform such obligations on behalf of
Buyer, as applicable, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement) and (ii)
assign its rights to indemnification under this Agreement to its lenders
providing financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
for collateral security purposes, but such assignment shall not release Buyer
from their obligations hereunder; provided, further, that if any assignment
hereunder increases the amount of withholding or other deduction required
under any applicable Law over the amount that would have been required had no
such assignment been made, then the Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Sellers Indemnitees to the extent of such increase. Any purported
assignment in contravention of this Section 13.5 shall be null and void.

Section 13.6 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid
or unenforceable by any court of competent jurisdiction, the other provisions
of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. Any provision of this
Agreement held invalid or unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in
full force and effect to the extent not held invalid or unenforceable. Section 13.7 Headings. The headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement
are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or
interpretation.

Section 13.8 Construction. This Agreement has been jointly drafted by the
Parties, so no principle of resolving ambiguities against the drafter shall
apply in construing any of the terms hereof. If a term is defined as one part
of speech (such as a noun), it shall have a corresponding meaning when used as
another part of speech (such as a verb). Unless indicated otherwise, terms
defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in the plural, and
vice versa. Unless the context of this Agreement clearly requires otherwise,
words importing the masculine gender shall include the feminine and neutral
genders, and vice versa. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein," "hereunder" and words of similar import, when used in this
Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
section or article in which such words appear. The words "ordinary course of
business", when used in this Agreement, shall mean "ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice". Any reference to "days" means
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified. The word "or"
shall be inclusive and not exclusive. References to any statute, rule or
regulation are to the statute, rule or regulation as amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced from time to time (and, in the case of statutes,
include any rules and regulations promulgated under said statutes) and to any
section of any statute, rule or regulation including any successor to said
section.

Section 13.9 Representation by Counsel. Each Party hereto acknowledges that it
has been advised by, or afforded the opportunity to be advised by, legal and
any other counsel. Each Party acknowledges that such Party has had a full
opportunity to review this Agreement and all related Exhibits, Schedules and
Ancillary Agreements and to negotiate any and all such documents in its sole
discretion, without any undue influence by any other Party hereto or any third
party.

Section 13.10 Schedules and Exhibits. All Article, Section, Schedule, Exhibit
and Annex references used in this Agreement are to Articles, Sections,
Schedules, Exhibits and Annexes to this Agreement unless otherwise specified.
The Sellers Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits attached hereto are an integral
part of this Agreement. All Exhibits and the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
attached to this Agreement are incorporated herein by this reference and all
references herein to this "Agreement" shall mean this Agreement together with
all such Exhibits and Schedules. Any matter disclosed pursuant to the
Schedules shall be deemed to be disclosed for all purposes under this
Agreement but such disclosure shall not be deemed to be an admission or
representation as to, or evidence of, the materiality of the item so
disclosed, nor shall it establish any standard of material for any purpose
whatsoever. Section 13.11 Governing Law. This Agreement and any dispute arising in
connection therewith will be governed by and construed under the law of the
State of Delaware without regard to conflicts-of-laws principles that would
require the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

Section 13.12 Jurisdiction.

(a) The Parties agree that any suit, action or proceeding arising out of, or
with respect to, this Agreement or any judgment entered by any court in
respect thereof shall be brought in the state or federal courts of the State
of Delaware, and the Parties hereby irrevocably accept the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of those courts for the purpose of any suit, action or
proceeding.

(b) In addition, the Parties each hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any judgment entered by the state or federal
courts of the State of Delaware, and hereby further irrevocably waive any
claim that any suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum.

Section 13.13 Specific Performance. The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree
that the failure of any Party to perform its agreements and covenants
hereunder, including its failure to take all actions as are necessary on its
part to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and by the
Ancillary Agreements, will cause irreparable injury to the other party, for
which damages, even if available, will not be an adequate remedy. Accordingly,
each party may seek the issuance of temporary, preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief by the courts set forth in Section 13.12(a) to compel
performance of the other Party's obligations, or to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, and to the
granting by such courts of the remedy of specific performance of its
obligations hereunder, without, in any such case, the requirement to post any
bond or other undertaking, in addition to any other rights or remedies
available hereunder or at law or in equity. Each Party expressly agrees and
acknowledges that, in consideration of the uniqueness of the other Party's
circumstances, each Party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief and
specific performance, and to such further and other relief as may be necessary
and proper to ensure compliance by the other Party with its obligation to
cause the Closing to occur, and each Party waives the necessity of posting
bond or other security (any requirements therefor being expressly waived). The
Parties acknowledge that the provisions of this Section 13.13 are reasonably
necessary and commensurate with the need to protect the Parties against
irreparable harm and to protect their legitimate business interests. Section 13.14 Service of Process. Each Party irrevocably consents to the
service of process outside the territorial jurisdiction of the courts referred
to in Section 13.12 in any such action or proceeding by mailing copies thereof
by registered United States mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested,
to its address as specified in or pursuant to Section 13.12. However, the
foregoing shall not limit the right of a Party to effect service of process on
the other Party by any other legally available method.

Section 13.15 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES (TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW) ITS RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR
CAUSE OF ACTION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY DEALINGS
BETWEEN THEM RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
RELATIONSHIP THAT IS BEING ESTABLISHED. THE SCOPE OF THIS WAIVER IS INTENDED
TO BE ALL-ENCOMPASSING OF ANY AND ALL DISPUTES THAT MAY BE FILED IN ANY COURT
AND THAT RELATE TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING CONTRACT
CLAIMS, TORT CLAIMS, BREACH OF DUTY CLAIMS AND ALL OTHER COMMON LAW AND
STATUTORY CLAIMS. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL
INDUCEMENT TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT, THAT EACH PARTY HAS ALREADY RELIED ON
THE WAIVER IN ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT EACH PARTY WILL CONTINUE
TO RELY ON THE WAIVER IN THEIR RELATED FUTURE DEALINGS. EACH PARTY FURTHER
WARRANTS AND REPRESENTS IT HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL,
AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING
CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. THIS WAIVER IS IRREVOCABLE, MEANING THAT IT
MAY NOT BE MODIFIED EITHER ORALLY OR IN WRITING, AND THE WAIVER SHALL APPLY TO
ANY SUBSEQUENT AMENDMENTS, RENEWALS, SUPPLEMENTS OR MODIFICATIONS TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR TO ANY OTHER DOCUMENTS OR AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, THIS AGREEMENT MAY BE FILED
AS A WRITTEN CONSENT TO A TRIAL BY THE COURT.

Section 13.16 No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns and nothing herein, express or implied (including Article IX and
Article X), shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the
Parties hereto and such permitted successors and assigns, any legal or
equitable rights or remedies hereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Sellers and Buyer acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
Article VII are included for the sole benefit of the Sellers and Buyer and
that nothing in Article VII, whether express or implied, (i) shall create any
third party beneficiary or other rights (ii) shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Employee Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or other
benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement, (iii) shall limit the right of
Buyer or its Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Buyer
Benefit Plan or other benefit plan, agreement or other arrangement following
the Closing or (iv) shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights
(A) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Business Employee
or any other current or former employee of the Sellers, the Purchased
Entities, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, any participant in any
Employee Benefit Plan, Buyer Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan,
agreement or other arrangement or any dependent or beneficiary thereof or (B)
to continued employment with Sellers, the Purchased Entities, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates.

Section 13.17 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of
signature pages by electronic transmission shall constitute effective
execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the Parties and may be used in
lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of the Parties
transmitted by electronic transmission shall be deemed to be their original
signatures for all purposes.

Section 13.18 No Recourse. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no representative or Affiliate (other than controlled Affiliates) of
Buyer shall have any liability to the Sellers or any other Person as a result
of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation of Buyer in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. This
Agreement (and each agreement, certificate and instrument delivered pursuant
hereto) shall not create or be deemed to create or permit any personal
liability or obligation on the part of any representative or investor of Buyer
or its Affiliates (other than controlled Affiliates). All claims (whether in
contract or in tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected
