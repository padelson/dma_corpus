WITNESSETH

each unanimously (among those present) (i) determined that it is in the best
interests of their respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, (ii) approved and
declared advisable the merger of Acquisition Sub with and into the Company
(the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and (iii) adopted this Agreement and approved
the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Acquisition Sub and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that it is fair and advisable for Parent to
acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
herein, (ii) approved and adopted this Agreement, including the Offer and the
Merger, in accordance with the DGCL, and (iii) determined to recommend that
the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer and tender their shares of

conditions of this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to this Agreement, Acquisition Sub has agreed to commence a
tender offer (the " _Offer_ ") to purchase any (subject to the Minimum
Condition) and all of the outstanding common stock (other than shares canceled
or converted pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_), par value $0.01 per share, of the
Company (the " _Common Stock_ "), at a price per share of Common Stock of

seller in cash, without interest;

 

WHEREAS, following consummation of the Offer, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, Acquisition Sub will be merged with

meanings ascribed to them by definition in this Agreement or in _Appendix A_.

ARTICLE II

 

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

 

Section 2.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Article VIII_ , as promptly as practicable (and in any event on or
before May 27, 2015) after the date hereof, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to) commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2
under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase all the outstanding Common
Stock at a price per share equal to the Offer Price. The consummation of the
Offer, and the obligation of Acquisition Sub to accept for payment and pay for
any shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject
only to: (i) there being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date that number of shares of Common Stock
(excluding shares of Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery
procedures but not yet delivered) which, together with the number of shares
of Common Stock (if any) then owned by Parent or its subsidiaries, represents
a majority of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding (determined on a
fully diluted basis as described below) (collectively, the " _Minimum
Condition_ "); (ii) this Agreement not having been terminated in accordance
with its terms (the " _Termination Condition_ "); and (iii) the satisfaction,
or waiver by Parent or Acquisition Sub, of the other conditions and
requirements set forth in _Annex I_ (together with the Minimum Condition and
the Termination Condition, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). For purposes of
determining whether the Minimum Condition has been satisfied, the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding _plus_ the number of
shares of Common Stock which the Company would be required to issue pursuant
to any then outstanding warrants, options, benefit plans or obligations or
securities convertible or exchangeable into shares of Common Stock or
otherwise, but only to the extent so exercisable, convertible or exchangeable
prior to consummation of the Merger or exercisable, convertible or
exchangeable as a result of the consummation of the Offer or the Merger.

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the Termination
Condition and the satisfaction, or waiver by Parent or Acquisition Sub, of the
other Offer Conditions, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to) accept for payment and pay for all shares of Common Stock
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer on or
promptly after the applicable Expiration Date. Subject to _Section 3.7_, the
Offer 

 



2  Price payable in respect of each share of Common Stock validly tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid net to the seller
in cash, without interest.

 

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to
Purchase_ ") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, including the Offer Conditions. Unless
previously approved by the Company in writing, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall not: (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of
consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change the number of shares of
Common Stock to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum
Condition, the Termination Condition or the conditions set forth in clauses
(b) or (c)(i) of _ Annex I_, (v) add any condition to the Offer or any term
that is adverse to the holders of Common Stock, (vi) extend the expiration of
the Offer except as required or permitted by this _Section 2.1_, (vii)
provide for a "subsequent offering period" (or any extension thereof) in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act or (viii) modify,
supplement or amend any other term or condition of the Offer in a manner
adverse to the holders of Common Stock.

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at 11:59 p.m. (New York City time) on the date that is twenty
(20) Business Days following the commencement of the Offer, as calculated in
accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act (such time and date, the
" _Initial Expiration Date_ ") or if the Initial Expiration Date has been
extended in accordance with this Agreement, on the date to which the Offer has
been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later time and date to
which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ ").

(e) If as of any then scheduled Expiration Date, any Offer Condition has not
been satisfied or, to the extent waivable by Parent or Acquisition Sub
pursuant to this Agreement, waived by Parent or Acquisition Sub, Acquisition
Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to) extend the Offer
for successive periods of up to five (5) Business Days each (or such longer
period of up to twenty (20) Business Days if Parent so desires and the Company
consents in writing prior to such extension), the length of each such period
to be determined by Parent in its sole discretion in order to permit the
satisfaction of the Offer Conditions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond November 12,
2015 (the " _Outside Date_ "), unless at such time Parent would be prohibited
from terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_, and shall not
extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date without the Companys consent.
In addition, Acquisition Sub shall extend the Offer for any period or periods
required by applicable Law or applicable rules, regulations, interpretations
or positions of the SEC or its staff or the NYSE; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Outside Date, unless at such time Parent would be prohibited from terminating
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_, and shall not extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date without the Companys consent.

(f) Acquisition Sub shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article VIII_, Acquisition Sub shall (and Parent
shall cause Acquisition Sub to) promptly terminate the Offer and shall not
acquire the shares of Common Stock pursuant thereto. If the Offer is
terminated by Acquisition Sub, or this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Acceptance Time, Acquisition Sub 

 



3  shall promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of
Acquisition Sub to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered
shares of Common Stock that have not then been purchased in the Offer to the
registered holders thereof.

(g) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer,
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall:

(i) file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the Exchange Act, a
Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together
with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_");

 

(ii) deliver a copy of the Schedule TO, including all exhibits thereto, to the
Company at its principal executive offices in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act;

(iii) give telephonic notice of the information required by Rule 14d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, and mail by means of first class mail a
copy of the Schedule TO, to the NYSE in accordance with Rule 14d-3(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act; and

 

(iv) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of shares of
Common Stock as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including
the Exchange Act.

(h) The Schedule TO shall include as exhibits, the Offer to Purchase, a form
of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement, and a form of
notice of guaranteed delivery (the Schedule TO and the documents included
therein pursuant to which the Offer shall be made, together with any
amendments and supplements thereto, being referred to herein as the " _Offer
Documents_ "). Subject to the provisions of _Section 6.4_, the Company
consents to the inclusion of a description of the Company Recommendation in
the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the
one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the
extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and Parent and
Acquisition Sub agree to cause the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including
the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Acquisition
Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel promptly with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that Parent,
Acquisition Sub or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review any
proposed written or oral responses to the Schedule TO and Offer Documents and
Parent and Acquisition Sub shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company and its
counsel and to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with
the staff of the SEC related thereto.

 



4 Section 2.2 _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. No later than the date that the Schedule TO is initially
filed with the SEC by Acquisition Sub, the Company shall file with the SEC,
in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, a Tender
Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to
the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that shall contain the notice of appraisal rights to
holders of shares of Common Stock and, subject to the provisions of _Section
6.4_, the Company Recommendation. The Company agrees to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock, as and to the
extent required by all applicable Laws, including the Exchange Act. The
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Sub, on the other
hand, agree to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and the Company agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC and disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock, in
each case as and to the extent required by all applicable Laws, including the
Exchange Act. Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with
the SEC, and the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Acquisition Sub
and their counsel. In addition, the Company shall provide Parent, Acquisition
Sub and their counsel promptly with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. Parent, Acquisition Sub and their counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review any proposed written or oral responses and
the Company shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Acquisition Sub and their
counsel, and to participate in any substantive telephonic communications with
the staff of the SEC related thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
obligations of the Company in this _Section 2.2(a)_ shall not apply from and
after the time the Company Board effects a Change of Recommendation in
accordance with _Section 6.4_.

(b) _Company Information_. From time to time as requested by Acquisition Sub
or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause to be furnished to
Acquisition Sub mailing labels, security position listings, non-objecting
beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files available
to it containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial owners
of the shares of Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date, and
shall promptly furnish Acquisition Sub with such information (including, but
not limited to, updated lists of holders of the shares of Common Stock and
their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and non-objecting
beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as Acquisition Sub or its
agents may reasonably request in communicating with the record and beneficial
holders of shares of Common Stock, in connection with the preparation and
dissemination of the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents and the solicitation
of tenders of shares of Common Stock in the Offer. Parent and Acquisition Sub
and their agents shall hold in confidence the

 



5  information contained in any such labels, listings and files, will use such
information only in connection with such transactions and, if this Agreement
shall be terminated, will, upon request, deliver, and will cause their agents
to deliver, to the Company all copies of such information then in their
possession or control.

(c)  _Acceptance Time_. The Company shall register the transfer of shares of
Common Stock accepted for payment effective immediately after the time at
which Acquisition Sub accepts for payment shares of Common Stock tendered and
not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the " _Acceptance Time_ ");
_provided_ that Acquisition Sub pays for such shares of Common Stock at or
immediately after such transfer.

 

Section 2.3 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue under the name "AOL Inc." as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws
of the State of Delaware.

Section 2.4  _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible,
waiver of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place as soon as practicable following
consummation of the Offer, on a date to be specified by the parties hereto,
but no later than the third Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ hereof (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) at the offices of Weil, Gotshal and
Manges LLP, 767 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York 10153, unless another time,
date or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (such date being
the " _Closing Date_ ").

Section 2.5 _Effective Time_.

 

(a) Concurrently with the Closing, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall cause a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with
respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (the " _Secretary of State_ ") as provided under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective on the date and time at which the
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or at
such later date and time as is agreed between the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Effective Time_ ").

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess
all properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Acquisition Sub, and all of the claims, obligations, liabilities, debts and

ARTICLE III

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 3.1 _Effect of the Merger on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Acquisition Sub or the holders of any securities of the Company or Acquisition
Sub:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Company Securities; Conversion of Subsidiary-Owned
Securities_.

 

(i) Each share of Common Stock held by the Company as treasury stock or held
by Parent or Acquisition Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect
thereof.

 

(ii) Each share of Common Stock that is owned by any direct or indirect wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company or any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (other than Acquisition Sub) or of Acquisition Sub shall
be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation

 



7  such that the ownership percentage of any such subsidiary in the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time shall equal the ownership
percentage of such subsidiary in the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled or converted pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the
right to receive the Offer Price, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). The holders of certificates or book-entry shares which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Common Stock
(respectively, the " _Certificates_ "and " _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such Common Stock other than the right to
receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in
accordance with  _Section 3.2_ of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration,
or, with respect to Dissenting Shares, the rights set forth in Section 262 of
the DGCL.

 

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Acquisition
Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one (1) validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation and constitute the only outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement and
other than as contemplated by this Agreement, if at any time during the
period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change
in the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall occur as a result of
a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any
stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period,
the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change;  _provided_ that the Company may not effect such change
except as permitted by this Agreement.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_
"), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the applicable Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(b)_. At or before the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an amount
equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (all cash deposited with the
Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). At or immediately after the Effective
Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to the Surviving Corporation and
the Surviving Corporation shall disburse in cash the amounts payable
at Closing in respect of the vested Company Options pursuant to _Section
3.3(a)_ and the vested Company Share Unit Awards pursuant to _Section
3.3(b)_. In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the
payments contemplated by _Section 3.1(b)_ Parent shall promptly deposit, or
cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount
which is equal to

 



8  the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Paying Agent
shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of
Common Stock and (ii) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to
_Section 3.2(c)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose
other than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 3.2(c)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the third Business Day thereafter, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
or Book-Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such
other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and (y)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number
of shares of Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each
share of Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, to be mailed, or delivered by wire transfer, as elected by the
surrendering holder, promptly following the later to occur of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt and acceptance of such
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and
the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall be forthwith canceled. The Paying Agent shall accept such
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of
holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent,
upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only
to Parent as general creditor thereof for payment of their claims for cash,
without interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any Merger Consideration properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



9 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i) no such investment shall
relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the payments required by this
_Article III_ , and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide
additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of Common
Stock in the amount of such losses, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty days or
guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and
credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations
rated A-l or P-l or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest or income produced by such
investments will become a part of the Exchange Fund.

Section 3.3 _Treatment of Equity Awards and Company ESPP_.

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_.

 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that is
outstanding and unexercised and is vested as of the Effective Time (each, a "
_Vested Company Option_ "), shall be canceled by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Vested Company Option, in
consideration for the right to receive a cash payment with respect thereto
equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Vested Company Option as of the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common
Stock subject to such Vested Company Option as of the Effective Time (the "
_Vested Option Cash Payment_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall cause each
Vested Option Cash Payment to be paid, less any required withholding Taxes,
as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, if the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to a Vested
Company Option as of the Effective Time equals or exceeds the Merger
Consideration, such Vested Company Option shall be cancelled for no
consideration as of the Effective Time, and the holder thereof shall have no
further rights with respect thereto.

 

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Option (or portion thereof) that
is outstanding, unexercised and unvested as of Effective Time (each, an "
_Unvested Company Option_ "), shall, unless otherwise agreed to by Parent and
selected holders thereof, be canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of any holder of any Unvested Company Option, in
consideration for the right to receive, following the Effective Time and
subject to the conditions below, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to
the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to
such Unvested Company Option as of the Effective Time and (y) the excess, if
any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of Common
Stock subject to such Unvested Company Option as of the Effective Time (the "
_Unvested Option Cash Payment_ "). The Unvested Option Cash Payment which a
former holder of an Unvested Company Option may be eligible to receive shall
(1) be earned subject to the same vesting schedule and other vesting terms and
conditions (including any applicable acceleration provisions, except as
otherwise agreed to by Parent and selected holders

 



10  thereof in writing with respect to acceleration provisions relating to
certain specified employment or other service termination rights) which
applied to such holders Unvested Company Option as of the Effective Time and
(2) become payable, less any required withholding Taxes, on the date or dates
that such Unvested Company Option would have become vested under the vesting
schedule in place for such Unvested Company Option as of the Effective Time
(or an alternative date during the month in which such Unvested Company Option
would otherwise vest); _provided_ , that in no event shall any Unvested Option
Cash Payment be paid later than the last day of the calendar year in which
the Effective Time occurs. For the avoidance of doubt, if the exercise price
per share of Common Stock subject to an Unvested Company Option as of the
Effective Time equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Unvested
Company Option shall be cancelled for no consideration as of the Effective
Time, and the holder thereof shall have no further rights with respect
thereto.

 

(iii) As of the Effective Time, all Company Options (whether vested or
unvested) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive, in respect of a Company Option
with an exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such Company
Option as of the Effective Time that is less than the Merger Consideration,
the Vested Option Cash Payment and/or the Unvested Option Cash Payment, as
applicable.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Share Unit Awards_.

 

(i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Share Unit Award (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and is vested as of the Effective Time (each, a
" _Vested Company Share Unit Award_ "), shall be canceled by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Vested Company
Share Unit Award, in consideration for the right to receive a cash payment
with respect thereto equal to (x) _the product of_ (1) the number of shares
of Common Stock subject to such Vested Company Share Unit Award as of the
Effective Time and (2) the Merger Consideration _plus_  (y) the aggregate
cash amount of any outstanding and unpaid "dividend equivalents" credited to
such holder in respect of such holders Vested Company Share Unit Award, if
any, as of the Effective Time (the " _Vested Company Share Unit Award Cash
Payment_ "). The Surviving Corporation shall cause each Vested Company Share
Unit Award Cash Payment to be paid, less any required withholding Taxes, as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time;  _provided_ , that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
payment in respect of a Vested Company Share Unit Award which immediately
prior to such cancellation was subject to Section 409A of the Code shall be
made on the applicable settlement date for such Vested Company Share Unit
Award if required in order to comply with Section 409A of the Code.

 

(ii) As of the Effective Time, each Company Share Unit Award (or portion
thereof) that is outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time (each, an
" _Unvested Company Share Unit Award_ "), shall, unless otherwise agreed to by
Parent and selected holders thereof, be canceled by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of any holder of any Unvested Company Share
Unit Award, in consideration for

 



11  the right to receive, following the Effective Time and subject to the
conditions below, a cash payment with respect thereto equal to (x) _the
product of_ (1) the number of shares of Common Stock subject to such Unvested
Company Share Unit Award as of the Effective Time and (2) the Merger
Consideration _plus_ (y) the aggregate cash amount of any outstanding and
unpaid "dividend equivalents" credited to such holder in respect of such
holders Unvested Company Share Unit Award, if any, as of the Effective Time
(the " _Unvested Company Share Unit Award Cash Payment_ "). The Unvested
Company Share Unit Award Cash Payment which a former holder of an Unvested
Company Share Unit Award may be eligible to receive shall (A) be earned
subject to the same vesting schedule and other vesting terms and conditions
(including any applicable acceleration provisions, except as otherwise agreed
to by Parent and selected holders thereof in writing with respect to
acceleration provisions relating to certain specified employment or other
service termination rights) which applied to such holders Unvested Company
Share Unit Award as of the Effective Time and (B) become payable, less any
required withholding Taxes, on the applicable settlement date (or an
alternative date during the month in which such settlement date occurs) or
within the applicable settlement period following vesting that applied to
such Unvested Company Share Unit Award as of the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
that, with respect to performance-based vesting conditions, performance shall
be determined (x) for Unvested Company Share Unit Awards that are subject to
total shareholder return performance metrics or revenue-based performance
metrics, in accordance with the terms of the applicable Unvested Company Share
Unit Award agreement as of the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _further_ ,
that, with respect to any Unvested Company Share Unit Award that is subject to
revenue-based performance metrics only, the revenue-based performance metrics
under any such Unvested Company Share Unit Award shall be subject to
reasonable good faith adjustment in accordance with the terms of the
adjustment provisions under such Unvested Company Share Unit Award agreement
and the Company Plan under which it was granted, and (y) for Unvested Company
Share Unit Awards that are subject to segment-based performance metrics,
based on an assumption of performance achievement at target.

 

(iii) As of the Effective Time, all Company Share Unit Awards (whether vested
or unvested) shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to
exist, and each holder of a Company Share Unit Award shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Vested Company
Share Unit Award Cash Payment and/or the Unvested Company Share Unit Award
Cash Payment, as applicable.

(c) _Treatment of Company RSAs_. As of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each Company RSA that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall, unless otherwise agreed to by Parent and selected
holders thereof, be canceled by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any holder of any Company RSA, in consideration for the right to
receive, following the Effective Time and subject to the conditions below, a
cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of (i) the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to such Company RSA as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " _Company RSA Cash
Payment_ "). The Company RSA Cash Payment which a former holder of a Company
RSA may be eligible to receive shall (x) be earned subject to the same
vesting schedule and other vesting terms and conditions (including

 



12  any applicable acceleration provisions, except as otherwise agreed to by
Parent and selected holders thereof in writing with respect to acceleration
provisions relating to certain specified employment or other service
termination rights) which applied to such holders Company RSA as of the
Effective Time and (y) become payable, less any required withholding Taxes, on
the date or dates that such Company RSA would have become vested under the
vesting schedule in place for such Company RSA as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (or an alternative date during the month in which such Company
RSA would otherwise vest).

 

(d) _Treatment of Company ESPP_. The Company ESPP will continue to be operated
in accordance with its terms and past practice for the Offering Period (as
defined in the Company ESPP) in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Offering Period_ "); _provided_ , that if the Expiration Date occurs
prior to the end of the Current Offering Period, the Company shall shorten
the Current Offering Period so that the Current Offering Period ends ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Expiration Date (the " _Last Exercise Date_ "). The
Company shall notify each Company ESPP participant in writing at least two
(2) weeks prior to the Last Exercise Date that the last date during the
Current Offering Period on which an outstanding purchase right under the
Company ESPP will be exercised has been changed to the Last Exercise Date and
that his or her purchase right will be exercised automatically on the Last
Exercise Date, unless prior to such date, he or she has canceled his or her
election to participate in the Current Offering Period in accordance with the
terms of the Company ESPP, to the extent applicable. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in the foregoing, (i) the Company shall suspend the
commencement of any future Offering Period under the Company ESPP (excepting,
for the avoidance of doubt, the Current Offering Period) unless and until
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article VIII_ and (ii) on and
after the date of this Agreement, no Person shall become a participant in the
Company ESPP and no participant in the Company ESPP shall be eligible to
increase the level of such participants payroll deductions under the Company
ESPP.

 

(e) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the
Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Plan or
the Director Plan) shall adopt all resolutions and take all other actions
(including, obtaining all consents) as may be necessary or required in
accordance with applicable Law, each Company Plan, the Director Plan, the
Equity Awards or otherwise to terminate each of the Company Plans and the
Director Plan (provided, that no action to terminate the Director Plan shall
be taken earlier than thirty (30) days prior to the Effective Time) and to
effectuate all of the actions contemplated by this _Section 3.3_, contingent
on the Closing.

 

Section 3.4 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to this  _Article III_.

 



13 Section 3.5 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 3.1(b)_, to
the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under
Section 262 of the DGCL, shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly
complied with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares shall have the rights
set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, such
holders shares of Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been
converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such shares shall not
thereafter be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.

 

Section 3.6 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Common Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be
canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as provided
for in this _Article III_ , for each share of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificates. All cash paid upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article III_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, subject, however, to Parent and the
Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other
distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time which may have
been authorized by the Company in compliance with this Agreement and
which remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

Section 3.7 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, each of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. To the extent that amounts
are so deducted and withheld by or on behalf of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made and shall
be paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority on such persons
behalf.

Section 3.8 _Subsequent Actions_. The parties agree to take all necessary
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable
following the Offer Closing without a meeting of the Companys stockholders,
as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

or (ii) as disclosed in the corresponding section of the separate disclosure
letter which has been delivered by the Company to Parent prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the

apparent), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 

Section 4.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of the
Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation or legal entity duly organized
or formed, validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization or formation and has the requisite
corporate, partnership or limited liability company or other
organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the
failure to have such power and authority would not be material to the Company
and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of the Company and its
subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business or licensed as a foreign
corporation or other entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties or
assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
as would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws_. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws, or equivalent organizational documents, each as

annual report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2014. The
Certificate of Incorporation and the By-laws and the equivalent
organizational documents of each of the Companys subsidiaries are in full
force and effect. None of the Companys subsidiaries is in violation of any
provision of its respective certificate of incorporation or by-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) except as would not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation of any provision of
the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws except as would not, and would
not reasonably be expected to, result in material liability to Parent or the
Company from and after the Closing or prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

applies to or purports to apply to this Agreement, the Offer or the Merger or

Section 4.26 _Rights Plan_. The Company and the Company Board have taken all
actions necessary so that neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement nor the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein will cause (a) the grant of any new rights
under the Rights Plan or (b) any rights previously granted under the
Rights Plan to become exercisable, including, for the avoidance of doubt, an
affirmative determination by the Company Board that each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub is an "Exempt Person" (as defined in the Rights Plan) and that
the entry into this Agreement, the Offer, the Offer Closing, the Merger and

and conditions of the Company Indenture, as supplemented by the Supplemental
Indenture, to (a) convert such holders Company Note only into the right to
receive the Note Merger Consideration, (b) require the Company to repurchase
such holders Company Note for cash in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company Indenture or (c) subject to such modifications as
may be required to comply with applicable Law, continue to hold such holders
Company Note provided that such Company Note shall in no event be convertible
into shares of Common Stock. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
Company Note shall be convertible into no more than 17.4456 shares of Common
Stock per one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) of principal amount of Company
Notes. Immediately after the Effective Time, the amount into which one
thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) of principal amount of Company Notes will be
convertible pursuant to the Company Indenture, as supplemented by the

this sentence only that the date hereof is the "Effective Date" as defined in
the Company Indenture.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND ACQUISITION SUB

 

Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant
to the Company as of the date hereof as follows:

 

Section 5.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_. Each of Parent and
Acquisition Sub is a corporation or legal entity duly organized or formed,
validly existing and in good standing, under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization or formation and has the requisite corporate power and authority
and all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
except where (i) the failure to have such power or authority would not be
material to Parent and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole and (ii) the failure
to have such governmental approvals would not have, and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. Each of Parent and Acquisition Sub is duly qualified or
licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties
or assets or conduct of its business requires such qualification or licensing,
except for such failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing
that would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.2 _Certificate of Incorporation, By-Laws, and Other Organizational
Documents_. Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct
copy of the certificate of incorporation, by-laws (or equivalent
organizational documents), and other organizational documents, each as amended
to date, of each of Parent and Acquisition Sub (collectively, "
_Parent Organizational Documents_ "). The Parent Organizational Documents are
in full force and effect. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, the other parties thereto are in violation of any provision of the
Parent Organizational Documents, as applicable, except as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.3 _Authority Relative to Agreement_. Each of Parent and Acquisition
Sub has all necessary power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub and the
consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized
by all necessary corporate action of Parent and Acquisition Sub and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of Parent or Acquisition Sub or their
respective stockholders are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (other than, with respect to the Merger, (x)
the adoption of this Agreement by Parent in its capacity as the sole
stockholder of Acquisition Sub, which adoption shall occur immediately
following the execution of this Agreement, and (y) the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State). This Agreement has
been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent and Acquisition Sub
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company,
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent
and Acquisition Sub, enforceable against Parent and Acquisition Sub in
accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights, and by general equitable principles).

 



37 Section 5.4 _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub
does not, and the performance of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition Sub
will not, (i) conflict with or violate the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws (or equivalent organizational documents) of (A) Parent or (B) Acquisition
Sub, (ii) assuming the consents, approvals and authorizations specified in
_Section 5.4(b)_ have been received and the waiting periods referred to
therein have expired, and any condition precedent to such consent, approval,
authorization, or waiver has been satisfied, conflict with or violate any Law
applicable to Parent or Acquisition Sub or by which any property or asset of
Parent or Acquisition Sub is bound or affected or (iii) result in any breach
of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or
both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any property or asset of Parent or Acquisition Sub
pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture or credit agreement, or any
other contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other
instrument or obligation to which Parent or Acquisition Sub is a party or by
which Parent or Acquisition Sub or any property or asset of Parent or
Acquisition Sub is bound or affected, other than, in the case of clauses (ii)
and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences of the type referred to above which would not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Acquisition
Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Acquisition Sub of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, require any consent,
approval, authorization, waiver or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any Governmental Authority, except for applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act, Blue Sky Laws, the HSR Act and the German
Act against Restraints of Competition, filing and recordation of appropriate
merger documents as required by the DGCL and the rules of the NYSE or other
stock exchange, if applicable, and except where failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not have, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 5.5 _Absence of Litigation_. As of the date hereof, there is no claim,
action, proceeding, or investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened against either Parent or Acquisition Sub or any of their respective
properties or assets at law or in equity, and there are no Orders before any
arbitrator or Governmental Authority, in each case as would have, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.6  _Capitalization of Acquisition Sub_. As of the date of this
Agreement, the authorized share capital of Acquisition Sub consists of 1,000
shares, par value $0.01 per share, all of which are validly issued and
outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding share capital of Acquisition
Sub is, and at the Effective Time will be, owned by Parent, a person of which
Parent is a direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary, or a direct or
indirect wholly owned subsidiary of such a person. Acquisition Sub does not
have outstanding any option, warrant, right or other agreement pursuant to
which any person other than Parent may acquire any equity interest of
Acquisition Sub. Acquisition Sub was formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the

 



38  transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business
prior to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have
no, assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those
incident to its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

no broker, finder or investment banker is entitled to any brokerage, finders
or other fee or commission in connection with the Offer and the Merger based
upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

 

Section 5.8 _Funds_. Parent and Acquisition Sub will have as of the Acceptance
Time and the Effective Time, sufficient cash on hand for the satisfaction of
all of Parents and Acquisition Subs obligations under this Agreement,
including the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and the Total Common Merger
Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Equity Awards, and to
pay all related fees and expenses and any other amounts contemplated by this
Agreement to be paid by Parent or Acquisition Sub. Parents and Acquisition
Subs obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding Parents
or Acquisition Subs obtaining of funds to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.9 _Parent Ownership of Company Securities; DGCL Section 203_.
Parent and its subsidiaries do not "own" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) any shares of Common Stock or other securities of the Company or any
options, warrants or other rights to acquire Common Stock or other securities
of, or any other economic interest (through derivative securities or
otherwise) in, the Company. Neither Parent nor any of its "affiliates" or
"associates"(each as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) is, or has been at
any time with the last three years, an "interested stockholder" as defined in
Section 203 of the DGCL. Neither Parent nor any of its subsidiaries has taken,
or authorized or permitted any its Representatives to take, any action that
would cause Parent or any of its "affiliates" or "associates" (each as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) thereof to be deemed an "interested
stockholder" as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL or otherwise render Section
251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger.

Section 5.10 _Offer Documents_. The information supplied by Parent or
Acquisition Sub expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9 (and any amendment thereof or supplement thereto), will not,
when filed with the SEC, when distributed or disseminated to the Companys
stockholders, and at the Expiration Date, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The
Offer Documents, and all amendments thereto, and any other document required
to be filed with the SEC or required to be distributed or otherwise
disseminated to the Companys stockholders in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
provisions of Rule 14d-3 of the Exchange Act or any other applicable federal
securities laws, as the case may be, and will not, when filed with the SEC,
when distributed or disseminated to the Companys stockholders, and at the
Expiration Date, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that

 



39  Parent and Acquisition Sub make no representation or warranty with respect
to statements made in the Offer Documents or any other document filed or
distributed by Parent or Acquisition Sub based on information furnished by or
on behalf of the Company in writing expressly for inclusion therein.

Section 5.11 _Acknowledgement of Disclaimer of Other Representations and
Warranties_. Except for the representations and warranties contained in
Article IV or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement to
Parent or Acquisition Sub in connection with the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger, each of Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledges that neither the
Company nor any person on behalf of the Company makes any other express or
implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or their respective businesses or with respect to any other

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor any other
person has made or is making any representation or warranty with respect to,

other person resulting from, the distribution to Parent or Acquisition Sub, or
Parents or Acquisition Subs use of, any such information, including any

transactions contemplated

 



45  hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and gives the
other party the opportunity to attend any meetings, or to participate in any
communications with, a Governmental Authority to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Authority.

Section 6.3 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.1_, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the Confidentiality Agreement, the Company will (i) provide to Parent and its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal
counsel, investment bankers, agents and other representatives (collectively,
" _Representatives_ ") reasonable access during normal business hours to the
Companys employees, properties, books, commitments, contracts and records and
other information (including Tax Returns) as Parent may reasonably request
regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of
the Company and instruct the Companys independent accountants to provide
access to their work papers and such other information as Parent and
Acquisition Sub may reasonably request, (ii) permit Parent and Acquisition Sub
to make such inspections as they reasonably require and (iii) furnish promptly
to Parent and Acquisition Sub a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed or received by the Company during such period pursuant to the
requirements of the federal or state securities Laws that is not otherwise
made publicly available on the SECs Electronic Data-Gathering, Analysis and
Retrieval system; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to provide access to any information or documents which would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Company, (A) constitute a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege held by the
Company, (B) would violate an existing confidentiality obligation to or
agreement with any person; or (C) otherwise violate any applicable Laws; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clauses _(A)_ and _(B)_ , the
Company shall (1) advise Parent of the nature of any information or documents
withheld by the Company or any of its subsidiaries; (2) use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain any required consents (such as the redaction of
identifying or confidential information, entry into a joint defense agreement
or other agreement or by providing such access, inspections, data or other
information solely to outside counsel to avoid the loss of attorney-client
privilege) as are necessary to provide such access, inspections, data or other
information to Parent or Acquisition Sub in compliance with applicable Laws;
and (3) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to institute appropriate
substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances. Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated
by this _Section 6.3_ shall be conducted in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its
subsidiaries or result in damage or destruction of any property or assets of
the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Any access to the Companys
properties shall be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures and
insurance requirements and shall not include the right to perform invasive
testing.

 

(b) The information provided pursuant to this _Section 6.3_ shall be used
solely for the purpose of the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby. The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their or their Affiliates respective
obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, subject to  _Section
6.4(a)_.

 



46 Section 6.4 _Solicitation; Change of Recommendation_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, the Company agrees
that it and its subsidiaries shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives to, immediately
cease any discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing
with respect to a Competing Proposal and, until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, not, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or
knowingly facilitate or encourage any Competing Proposal; (ii) participate in
any negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any nonpublic
information with respect to, any Competing Proposal; (iii) engage in
discussions with any person with respect to any Competing Proposal; (iv)
approve or recommend any Competing Proposal; (v) enter into any letter of
intent or similar document or any agreement or commitment providing for any
Competing Proposal; (vi) take any action to make the provisions of any "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business combination" or
other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation (including any transaction
under, or a third party becoming an "interested stockholder" under, Section
203 of the DGCL), or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-
takeover provision in the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of
the Company or the Rights Plan, inapplicable to any person other than Parent
and its Affiliates or to any transactions constituting or contemplated by a
Competing Proposal; or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. The
Company shall promptly after the date hereof instruct each person that has
executed a confidentiality agreement (other than the Confidentiality
Agreement) relating to a Competing Proposal or potential Competing Proposal
with or for the benefit of the Company promptly to return to the Company or
destroy all information, documents, and materials relating to the Competing
Proposal or to the Company or its businesses, operations or affairs heretofore
furnished by the Company or any of its Representatives to such person or any
of its Representatives in accordance with the terms of any
confidentiality agreement with such person, and shall use reasonable best
efforts to enforce, and not waive without Parents prior written consent, any
standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality or other agreement with
such person; _provided_  that if the Company Board determines in good faith
that it would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under Applicable
Law not to do so, the Company may waive any standstill or similar provisions
in its agreements to the extent necessary to permit a person to make, on a
confidential basis to the Company Board, a Competing Proposal, conditioned
upon such person agreeing to disclosure of such Competing Proposal to Parent
and Acquisition Sub, in each case as contemplated by and subject to
compliance with this _Section 6.4_.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.4(a)_, if
the Company receives a bona fide, Competing Proposal not solicited after the
date hereof that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.4_ at any
time prior to the Acceptance Time which (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal
or (ii) which the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation
with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors could reasonably be
expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in
either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior Proposal, the Company may
take the following actions: (x) furnish information to the third party making
such Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , that substantially concurrently the
Company makes available such information to Parent to the extent such
information was not previously made available to Parent) and (y) engage in
discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Competing
Proposal, in each case of clauses (x) and (y), if, and only if, prior to so
furnishing such information, the Company receives from the third party an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable in the aggregate
to the Company than the 

 



47  Confidentiality Agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Company taking such actions as described in clauses (x) and (y) above,
the Company shall provide written notice to Parent of such determination of
the Company Board pursuant to clauses (i) or (ii) above. From and after the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in
any event within 48 hours) of the receipt of any Competing Proposal, and (A)
if it is in writing, deliver to Parent a copy of such Competing Proposal and
any related draft agreements and other written material setting forth the
terms and conditions of such Competing Proposal or (B) if oral, provide to
Parent a detailed summary of the material terms and conditions thereof
including the identity of the person making such competing proposal. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a prompt and timely basis of
the status and material details of any such Competing Proposal and with
respect to any material change to the terms of any such Competing
Proposal within 48 hours of such material change.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in _Section 6.4(d)_, neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof may (i) withdraw or withhold, amend, modify
or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub the Company
Recommendation or make any public announcement inconsistent with the Company
Recommendation, or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing, (ii) approve,
adopt, endorse, or recommend any Competing Proposal or any inquiry or proposal
that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (iii)
following the date any Competing Proposal or any material modification
thereto is first made public, sent or given to the stockholders of the
Company, fail to issue a press release that expressly reaffirms the Company
Recommendation within four (4) Business Days following Parents written
request to do so (which request may not be made more than twice with respect
to any such Competing Proposal and each material modification thereto), (iv)
fail to include the Company Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or any
amendment thereof, or (v) except as expressly contemplated by _Section
6.4(f)_, cause or permit the Company to enter into any contract, letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, or agreement in principle regarding
or providing for any Competing Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement) or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate,
delay or fail to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(any action described in clause (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v), whether taken
by the Company, the Company Board or any committee thereof, being referred to
as a " _Change of Recommendation_ ").

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if (i) an event, fact, circumstance,
development, change or occurrence (an " _Intervening Event_ ") that materially
affects the business, assets or operations of the Company that is unknown to
the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and reasonably should not
have been known as of the date of this Agreement, becomes known to the Company
Board or (ii) the Company receives a Competing Proposal which the Company
Board concludes in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel
and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving
effect to all of the adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be
offered by Parent, the Company Board may effect a Change of Recommendation if
the Company Board has concluded in good faith after consultation with the
Companys outside legal advisors that the failure of the Company Board to make
such Change of Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such action may be only be taken (A) if the

 



48  Company shall have (x) fully complied with this _Section 6.4_ and (y) first
provided prior written notice to Parent in advance of its intention to make a
Change of Recommendation and the reasons therefor, including the terms of any
Competing Proposal with respect to which the Change of Recommendation relates
and the identity of the person making such Competing Proposal (it being
understood that the delivery of such notice shall not, in and of itself, be
deemed a Change in Recommendation) and (B) at a time that is after the third
(3rd) Business Day following the Companys delivery to Parent of such notice,
during which time Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company one or
more proposals for amendments to this Agreement and, if requested by Parent,
the Company shall negotiate with the Parent in good faith with respect
thereto, if the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with the Companys outside legal advisors, taking into account all amendments
or revisions to this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the failure of the
Company Board to effect such Change of Recommendation still would
be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. Any material amendment to a Competing Proposal to which such
Change of Recommendation relates, including any revision to price, shall
require the Company to deliver to Parent a new notice and again comply with
the requirements of this _Section 6.4(d)_ with respect to such revised
Competing Proposal.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or
its subsidiaries from complying with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a)
of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act (including making any
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) thereunder), or to prohibit the Company from
making any disclosure if the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, nor shall
any such action be deemed to constitute a breach of the Companys obligations
under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section
6.4(e)_ shall permit the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation
(including in compliance with Rule 14e-2, Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or other applicable Law)
without complying with _Section 6.4(d)_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, any
such disclosure that does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation (other than
a "stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall constitute a
Change of Recommendation.

 

(f) If at any time prior to the Acceptance Time the Company Board has
concluded in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors that a Competing Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may cause the Company to terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.1(h)_, pay the Company Termination
Fee and enter into a binding written agreement (a " _Superior Proposal
Agreement_ ") with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such termination shall only be effective if: (i) the Company (x) shall
have fully complied with this _Section 6.4_ and (y) first provided prior
written notice to Parent in advance of its intention to terminate this
Agreement of the terms of the Superior Proposal, including the final draft of
the Superior Proposal Agreement and the identity of the person making such
Competing Proposal; (ii) at a time that is after the third (3rd) Business Day
following the Companys delivery to Parent of such notice, during which
time Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company one or more proposals
for amendments to this Agreement and, if requested by Parent, the Company
shall

 



49  negotiate with Parent in good faith with respect thereto, if the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside
legal and financial advisors, taking into account all amendments or revisions
to this Agreement proposed by Parent, that the Competing Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company pays the Company Termination Fee to
Parent upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement; and (iv) the Company enters into a Superior Proposal
Agreement. Any material amendment to a Competing Proposal, including any
revision to price, shall require the Company to deliver to Parent a
new notice and again comply with the requirements of this _Section 6.4(f)_
with respect to such revised Competing Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Company may simultaneously give notice of its intention both to make a
Change of Recommendation and to terminate this Agreement to enter into a
Superior Proposal Agreement and the notice and negotiation periods set forth
in _Section 6.4(d)_ and this _Section 6.4(f)_ may pass simultaneously.

 

(g) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any bona
fide proposal (other than a proposal or offer by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries) for (i) any merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, issuance of securities, direct or indirect acquisition of
securities, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other
similar transaction in which (x) a person or "group"(as defined in the
Exchange Act and the rules promulgated thereunder) of persons directly or
indirectly acquires, or if consummated in accordance with its terms would
acquire, beneficial or record ownership of securities representing more than
10% of the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the
Company; or (y) the Company issues securities representing more than 10% of
the outstanding shares of any class of voting securities of the Company; (ii)
any direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange, transfer, acquisition or
disposition of any assets of the Company and of the subsidiaries of the
Company that constitute or account for (x) more than 10% of the consolidated
net revenues of the Company, consolidated net income of the Company or
consolidated book value of the Company; or (y) more than 10% of the fair
market value of the assets of the Company; or (iii) any liquidation
or dissolution of the Company.

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a Competing
Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal
increased to fifty percent (50%)) on terms that the Company Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside financial and
legal advisors, would (A) offer a higher per share price to the stockholders
of the Company than the Offer Price and (B) be more favorable to the
stockholders of the Company than the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, taking into account all factors the Company Board acting in good
faith considers to be appropriate, including (i) any proposal by Parent in
writing to amend or modify the terms hereof, (ii) the identity of the person
making such Competing Proposal, and (iii) the consideration, terms,
conditions, timing, likelihood of consummation, financing terms and legal,
financial, and regulatory aspects of such Competing Proposal.

 



50 Section 6.5 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), now existing in favor of
any Indemnitee as provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws
(or comparable organization documents) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or in any agreement shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect with respect to such Indemnitee. Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to) (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and advance expenses to,
Indemnitees with respect to all acts or omissions by them, in their
capacities as such at any time prior to the Effective Time, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and (ii) not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provisions of the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws (or
equivalent organizational documents) of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement and any
indemnification agreement of the Company or its subsidiaries or other
applicable contract that has been made available to Parent as in effect on
the date of this Agreement in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of any Indemnitees.

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.5(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries
will: (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless each Indemnitee against and
from any costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (A)
any action or omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees
capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or
Affiliates; or (B) the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and any transactions
contemplated hereby; and (ii) pay in advance of the final disposition of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses (including
attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking by or on
behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.5(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
6.5(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an
unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the " _D andO
Insurance_"), for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period or time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions
and limits of liability that are no less favorable than the coverage provided
under the Companys existing policies; _provided_ , that the premium for such
"tail" insurance shall not exceed 275% of the annual premium 

 



51  currently paid by the Company. If the Company or the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of at least six years from and after the Effective Time,
the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the Companys current
insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO
Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are
no less favorable than the coverage provided under the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof, or (ii) Parent will provide, or cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys
DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier, that
is no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 275% of the annual
premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ _further_
, that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such
amount; and _provided_ , _further_ that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier, containing terms (including with respect
to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles
and exclusions) that are no less favorable to any Indemnitee than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies.

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this  _Section 6.5_ applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 6.5_. The provisions of this _Section 6.5_
are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his or her
successors, heirs or representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable
expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any
Indemnitee in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this
_Section 6.5_.

 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.5_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or insurance policy or under any
agreement of any Indemnitee with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.5_ or _Section
9.6_ hereof to the contrary, this  _Section 6.5_ shall survive the
consummation of the Merger indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and
severally, on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
and its subsidiaries, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their
successors, heirs or representatives. In the event that Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers
or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall
succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.5_.

 



52 Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall promptly (and
in any event with two (2) Business Days) notify Parent, and Parent shall
promptly (and in any event with two (2) Business Days) notify the Company, of
(a) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, or from any person alleging
that the consent of such person is or may be required in connection with the
Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject
matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such
consent could be material to the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
(b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to such partys Knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby and
(c) the discovery by such party of any fact, circumstance or event, the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which could reasonably be expected,
individually or taken together with all other existing facts, events and
circumstances known to such party, to cause or result in any of the conditions
of the obligations of such party to consummate the Merger or the Offer not to
be satisfied or the satisfaction of which to be materially delayed. The
delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ shall not limit or
otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such
notice or the representations or warranties or covenants of the parties or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review
and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the Offer, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the
other (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
may be required by Law, court process or any listing agreement with or rules
of the NYSE or other stock exchange on which securities of Parent or the
Company is listed; _provided_ that Parent and Acquisition Sub may make public
statements regarding any Competing Proposal that has been made public or in
response to public statements of any person recommending or encouraging
stockholders of the Company not to tender their shares of Common Stock into
the Offer, after consulting with the Company and considering in good faith any
comments provided by the Company with respect to such public statements to
the extent permitted by Law, court process or any listing agreement with or
rules of the NYSE or other stock exchange on which securities of Parent is
listed. With respect to any communications to be delivered orally, including
by conference call or webcast, this _Section 6.7_ shall be deemed satisfied
if, to the extent practicable, the disclosing party gives advance notice of
such disclosure to the other party, including copies of any talking points,
scripts or similar documents, and consults with the other party and considers
in good faith any comments provided by such other party with respect thereto;
_provided_ , _further_ that the prior agreement of the other party shall be
required with respect to such disclosures to the extent that the non-
disclosing party reasonably determines that any disclosure would be materially
adverse to the non-disclosing party and it is reasonably practicable for the
disclosing party to seek such prior consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.7_ shall not apply to any
public statement made or proposed to be made by the Company or Parent in
connection with or following a Change of Recommendation.

 



53 Section 6.8 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) The Surviving Corporation shall provide or cause to be provided to each
employee of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continues as an employee of
the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), for a period
extending until the earlier of the termination of such Continuing Employees
employment with such entities or (i) the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, (x) a base wage or salary that is no less than that provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (y)
incentive compensation opportunities (including equity-based incentive
compensation opportunities) as a percentage of base wage or salary and with
respect to the degree of difficulty or achievement that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii) the last day of the calendar
year in which the Closing Date occurs, 401(k) benefits, severance benefit
eligibility, medical benefits and other welfare benefit plans, programs and
arrangements that, as determined in Parents discretion: (A) are substantially
comparable to those provided to each Continuing Employee under the Company
Benefit Plans as in effect at the Effective Time; (B) are substantially
comparable to those provided to management employees of Parent or its
subsidiaries; or (C) constitute any combination of the foregoing. The
provisions of this _Section 6.8_ shall not be construed or interpreted to
restrict in any way the Surviving Corporations or Parents ability to amend,
modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan (including to change the entities
who administer such Company Benefit Plans, or the manner in which such
Company Benefit Plans are administered) or any other plan made available to
the Continuing Employees or to terminate any persons employment at any time
and for any reason.

 

(b) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to: (i) waive any
applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with respect
to participation and coverage requirements in any replacement or successor
welfare benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation that an employee
of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is eligible to participate
in immediately following the Effective Time to the extent such exclusions or
waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time under the relevant Company Benefit
Plan in which such employee participated; (ii) provide each such employee
with credit for any co-payments and deductible paid prior to the Effective
Time (to the same extent such credit was given under the analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time) in satisfying any applicable
deductible or out-of-pocket requirements; and (iii) to the extent that any
Continuing Employee is eligible to participate in any employee benefit plan of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries following the
Effective Time, cause such plan to recognize the service of such Continuing
Employee with the Company and its subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting, vacation entitlement and
severance benefits (but not for benefit accrual under any defined benefit or,
retiree welfare plan) to the same extent such service was recognized by the
Company and its subsidiaries under any similar Company Benefit Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time; provided, that the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it
would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

 



54 (c) Without limiting the generality of _Section 6.8(a)_, with respect to any
Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries on or prior to the first

(d) The Company shall consult with Parent (and consider in good faith the
advice of Parent) prior to the Company sending any mass written notices or
other mass communication materials (including any postings to any website)
with respect to matters described in this  _Section 6.8_ (and, for the
avoidance of doubt, not including any compensation or benefits matters not
related to the Merger) to its employees or former employees of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries, but excluding any mass written notices or other mass
communication materials with respect to administrative matters. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with reasonable access
following advance notice to such employees or former employees for purposes
of Parents providing notices or other communication materials regarding
Parent compensation and benefit plans and the matters described in this
_Section 6.8_; _provided_ , that such access shall not unduly interfere with
the operation of the business of the Company prior to the Closing.

prior to the Effective Time: (i) provide any and all notices to; (ii) make any
and all filings or registrations with; and (iii) obtain any and all consents

benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
6.8_, expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any
rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
_Section 6.8_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section
6.8_ will create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company or any of its subsidiaries in
respect of continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.

and supervision over its and its subsidiaries operations.

such further actions, if any, as may be necessary or appropriate to ensure
that the dispositions of equity securities of the Company (including

Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is subject to Section
16 of the Exchange Act are exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

Time or the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall control the
defense of any litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the
Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including the Offer and the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company (i) shall promptly provide Parent with copies of all
proceedings and correspondence relating to such litigation, (ii) shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate with the Company regarding the defense
or settlement of any such litigation, (iii) shall give due consideration to
Parents advice with respect to such litigation and (iv) shall not

conditioned or delayed).

and rules and policies of the NYSE to cause the delisting of the Company
and of the Common Stock from the NYSE as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time and the deregistration of the Common Stock under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after such delisting.

 

Section 6.14 _Rule 14d-10(d) Matters_. Prior to the Acceptance Time and to the
extent permitted by Law, the Company (acting through the Company Board, its
compensation committee or its "independent directors" as defined by Rule
303A.02 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to the extent required) will take
all such steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or
understanding that has been or will be entered into by the Company or its
subsidiaries with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to

56 Section 6.15 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition," "fair
price," "business combination" or other anti-takeover Laws becomes or is
deemed to be applicable to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, then Parent, the Company and their respective boards
of directors or managers, as applicable, shall take all reasonable action
necessary so that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated herein and otherwise act to eliminate if possible, and otherwise
to minimize, the effects of such statute or regulation on the Offer, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.16 _Rights Plan_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier
of the Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , (i) the approval of the transactions
contemplated herein by the Company Board for purposes of causing any state
takeover statute or similar statue or regulation or the Rights Plan to
be inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger and other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement shall not be amended and no Change of Recommendation or
other action shall change such approval, and (ii) the Rights Plan shall not be
otherwise amended or qualified; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) if the
Merger shall not have been consummated prior to August 26, 2015, the Company
shall amend the Rights Plan prior to August 26, 2015 solely to provide that
the "Final Expiration Date" (as defined therein) shall mean the Outside Date
and (B) the Company may amend the Rights Plan to extend the Final Expiration
Date from and after a Change of Recommendation, in each case in accordance
with the Rights Plan. The Company and the Company Board shall take all
actions necessary so that any rights previously granted under the Rights Plan
shall not become exercisable as a result of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated herein. From the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with _Article VIII_ , the Company Board shall not,
without Parents prior written consent, (A) grant any waiver, amendment or
release under any state takeover statute or similar statue or regulation or
the Rights Plan, or (B) other than to the extent necessary for a confidential
proposal to be submitted to the Company Board in accordance with _Section
6.4_, grant any waiver, amendment or release under any confidentiality,
standstill or similar agreement (or terminate (other than in accordance with
its terms) or, if breached by the other party, fail to seek injunctive or
other remedies thereunder to prevent further breaches by such other party), in
either case except if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, following a Change of Recommendation, or if a court of competent
jurisdiction orders the Company to take such action or issues an injunction
mandating such action.

Section 6.17 _Treatment of Company Notes_.

 

(a) Within the time periods required by the terms of the Company Indenture,
the Company shall take all actions required to be performed by it prior to
the Effective Time by the terms of the Company Indenture as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement,

 



57  including the giving of any notices that may be required prior to the
Effective Time in connection with the convertibility of Company Notes.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section 6.17_, nothing
herein shall require the Company to pay any fees, incur or reimburse any costs
or expenses (other than attorneys fees arising in connection with the
fulfillment of the Companys obligations under this  _Section 6.17_), or
make any payment in connection with any Company Note or this _Section 6.17_
(including in connection with the settlement of any conversion obligation),
prior to the occurrence of the Effective Time.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, subject to the last sentence of _Section
6.17(a)_, the Company shall facilitate the execution and delivery to the
Trustee at the Effective Time of a supplemental indenture pursuant to Section
14.07(a) of the Company Indenture (the " _Supplemental Indenture_ "), which
will provide that, effective at the Effective Time, each outstanding Company
Note shall no longer be convertible into shares of Common Stock and shall be
convertible solely into the Note Merger Consideration that the holders of such
Company Notes are entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger upon conversion
in accordance with the Company Indenture; _provided_ , _however_ , for the
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Supplemental Indenture be executed
or delivered prior to the Effective Time.

 

(c) Subject to the last sentence of _Section 6.17(a)_, the Company shall take
all actions required to be performed by it prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to the terms of the Company Indenture in connection with the Offer,
the Offer Closing, the Merger, and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including the delivery to the Trustee of any documents or instruments
required prior to the Effective Time under the terms of the Company Indenture
in connection with the Offer, the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 6.18 _Treatment of Company Note Hedges and Company Warrants_. The
Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to enter into arrangements
(such arrangements to be in a form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent) with the Counterparties of each of the Company Note Hedges and the
Company Warrants to cause such Company Note Hedges and Company Warrants to
be terminated and cancelled as of the Effective Time, it being understood
that (i) the calculation and settlement of any amounts payable thereunder
shall be payable only in cash and subject to Parents prior approval and (ii)
nothing herein shall (A) require the Company to pay any fees, incur or
reimburse any costs or expenses, or make any payment in connection with any
Company Note Hedge or Company Warrant or pursuant to this Section 6.18, prior
to the occurrence of the Effective Time or (B) require the Company to enter

Acquisition Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any material

Parent within thirty (30) days of receipt by Parent of written notice of such
breach or failure; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if the Company has
materially breached any of its covenants, agreements, representations or
warranties contained in this Agreement, which breach has not been cured;

(e) by Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, if the Company shall
have breached or failed to perform in any material respect any of its

60 Section 8.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If:

(i) (y) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
_Section 8.1(b)_ (but only if at such time Parent would not be prohibited
from terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_) or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ and (z) within twelve (12) months after
termination of this Agreement, the Company consummates or enters into a
definitive agreement providing for any Competing Proposal (for purposes of
this subsection, substituting 50% for the 10% thresholds set forth in the
definition of Competing Proposal);

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(g)_; or

8.1(h)_;

then in any such event the Company shall pay to Parent a fee payable in cash
equal to $150,155,413 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), less the amount of
any Expense Reimbursement paid pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_, to an account
designated in writing by Parent, and neither the Company nor any other person
shall (subject to the provisions of _Section 8.2(ii)_) have any further
liability to Parent, Acquisition Sub or any other person with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (and upon payment thereof
the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (subject
to the provisions of _Section 8.2(ii)_) of Parent and Acquisition Sub against
the Company, its subsidiaries and their respective former, current and future
Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for a breach or failure
to perform hereunder), such payment to be made (x) in the case of _Section
8.3(a)(i)_, at the earlier of (A) when the Company enters into a letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other definitive
agreement providing for a transaction in respect of such Competing Proposal or
(B) when a transaction in respect of such Competing Proposal is consummated;
(y) in the case of _Section 8.3(a)(ii)_, no later than two (2) Business Days
after the termination of this Agreement; or (z) in the case of _Section
8.3(a)(iii)_, upon the termination of this Agreement; it being understood
that in no event shall the Company be required to pay any fee referred to in
this _Section 8.3_ on more than one occasion. For the avoidance of doubt and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any payment by the Company
of the Expense Reimbursement shall be credited against the Company Termination
Fee, if any, that may become payable by the Company hereunder, and following
receipt by Parent of the Company Termination Fee, Parent shall not thereafter
be entitled to receive any Expense Reimbursement.

Section 8.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of
the parties hereto by action taken by or on behalf of their respective boards
of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,

applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.4_, waive compliance by any other party with any
agreement or condition contained herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
failure or delay by the Company, Parent or 

 



61  Acquisition Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

 

Section 8.6 _Expenses_.

 

(a) All fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party or parties, as
applicable, incurring such fees and expenses whether or not the Offer and/or
the Merger is consummated, except that Parent shall pay all filing fees under
the HSR Act and the German Act against Restraints of Competition.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
_Section 8.1(e)_ or _Section 8.1(b)_ and provided that, solely with respect
to _Section 8.1(b)_, prior to such termination the conditions set forth in
clause (b) and (c)(i) of _Annex I_ have been satisfied, then the Company shall
reimburse Parent $42,901,547 in respect of expenses incurred by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Expense
Reimbursement_ "), without need for supporting documentation. Any Expense
Reimbursement payment shall be made by wire transfer of same day funds to an
account designated by Parent within two (2) Business Days of such termination;
it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion.

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 8.6(b)_, in the event that this Agreement
is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(e)_ due solely to the
breach by the Company of a representation and warranty set forth in _Section
4.3(a)-(d)_ (Capitalization) but at the time of such termination
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 4.3(a)-(d)_
(Capitalization) are true and correct in all material respects, then the
Company shall not be obligated to pay Parent the Expense Reimbursement as
otherwise provided pursuant to _Section 8.6(b)_.

participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision
of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article,
Section, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article or Section
of, or an Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. The

only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "made
available to Parent" and words of similar import refer to information posted

maintained by the Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the " _Data Room_ ") or otherwise delivered to Parent or a

subsidiaries" of the Company shall include any subsidiary of which the
Company owns, directly or indirectly, all of the equity interests.

Section 9.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law, or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

required to be true and correct in all respects only as of such time), except
for any failures to be so true and correct that, individually or in the

or requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to,
and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub to extend,
terminate, amend and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the Agreement. The failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to
