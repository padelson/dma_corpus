the assets of the Trust.

Administrators.

required to be registered under the Investment Company Act, and (ii) fail to be
classified as a "grantor trust" for United States federal income tax purposes.
The Administrators and the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the
Common Securities shall not take any action inconsistent with the treatment of
the Debentures as indebtedness of the Debenture Issuer for United States federal
income tax purposes. In this connection, the Administrators and the Holders of a

proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under this Declaration and such
proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or has been
determined adversely to the Institutional Trustee or to such Holder, then and in
every such case the Sponsor, the Institutional Trustee and the Holders shall,
subject to any determination in such proceeding, be restored severally and
respectively to their former positions hereunder, and thereafter all rights and
remedies of the Institutional Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though
no such proceeding had been instituted.

         Securities;

                  (ii) acquire any assets other than as expressly provided

         whatsoever other than as expressly provided herein;

                  (vi) issue any securities or other evidences of beneficial
         ownership of, or beneficial interest in, the Trust other than the
         Securities;

                  (vii) carry on any "trade or business" as that phrase is used
         in the Code; or

                  (viii) other than as provided in this Declaration (including

         classified as a "grantor trust" for United States federal income tax
         purposes.

         Section 2.8. Powers and Duties of the Institutional Trustee.

         (a) The legal title to the Debentures shall be owned by and held of
record in the name of the Institutional Trustee in trust for the benefit of the
Trust and the Holders of the Securities. The right, title and interest of the

Section 4.3. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective whether or
not conveyancing documents with regard to the Debentures have been executed and
delivered.

         (b) The Institutional Trustee shall not transfer its right, title and
interest in the Debentures to the Administrators.

         (c) The Institutional Trustee shall:

         the Capital Securities and Holders of the Common Securities from the
         Property Account in accordance with Section 5.1. Funds in the Property
         Account shall be held uninvested until disbursed in accordance with
         this Declaration;

                  (ii) engage in such ministerial activities as shall be
         necessary or appropriate to effect the redemption of the Capital
         Securities and the Common Securities to the extent the Debentures are
         redeemed or mature; and



                                       14
<PAGE>

                  (iii) upon written notice of distribution issued by the
         Administrators in accordance with the terms of the Securities, engage
         in such ministerial activities as shall be necessary or appropriate to
         effect the distribution of the Debentures to Holders of Securities upon
         the occurrence of certain circumstances pursuant to the terms of the
         Securities.

         (d) The Institutional Trustee may bring or defend, pay, collect,
compromise, arbitrate, resort to legal action with respect to, or otherwise
adjust claims or demands of or against, the Trust that arise out of or in
connection with an Event of Default of which a Responsible Officer of the
Institutional Trustee has actual knowledge or arises out of the Institutional
Trustee's duties and obligations under this Declaration; provided, however, that
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and such event is
attributable to the failure of the Debenture Issuer to pay interest or principal
on the Debentures on the date such interest or principal is otherwise payable
(or in the case of redemption, on the redemption date), then a Holder of the
Capital Securities may directly institute a proceeding for enforcement of
payment to such Holder of the principal of or interest on the Debentures having
a principal amount equal to the aggregate liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities of such Holder (a "Direct Action") on or after the respective due
date specified in the Debentures. In connection with such Direct Action, the
rights of the Holders of the Common Securities will be subrogated to the rights
of such Holder of the Capital Securities to the extent of any payment made by
the Debenture Issuer to such Holder of the Capital Securities in such Direct
Action; provided, however, that no Holder of the Common Securities may exercise
such right of subrogation so long as an Event of Default with respect to the
Capital Securities has occurred and is continuing.

         (e) The Institutional Trustee shall continue to serve as a Trustee
until either:

                  (i) the Trust has been completely liquidated and the proceeds
         of the liquidation distributed to the Holders of the Securities
         pursuant to the terms of the Securities and this Declaration; or

                  (ii) a Successor Institutional Trustee has been appointed and
         has accepted that appointment in accordance with Section 4.3.

         (f) The Institutional Trustee shall have the legal power to exercise
all of the rights, powers and privileges of a Holder of the Debentures under the
Indenture and, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the
Institutional Trustee may, for the benefit of Holders of the Securities, enforce
its rights as holder of the Debentures subject to the rights of the Holders
pursuant to this Declaration (including Annex I) and the terms of the
Securities.

         The Institutional Trustee must exercise the powers set forth in this
Section 2.8 in a manner that is consistent with the purposes and functions of
the Trust set out in Section 2.3, and the Institutional Trustee shall not take
any action that is inconsistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set
out in Section 2.3.

         Section 2.9. Certain Duties and Responsibilities of the Institutional
Trustee and Administrators.

         (a) The Institutional Trustee, before the occurrence of any Event of
Default and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default that may
have occurred, shall undertake to perform only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Declaration and no implied covenants shall be read into this
Declaration against the Institutional Trustee. In case an Event of Default has
occurred (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.7), the
Institutional Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this Declaration, and use the same degree of care and skill in their
exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of his or her own affairs.

         (b) The duties and responsibilities of the Institutional Trustee and
the Administrators shall be as provided by this Declaration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no provision of this Declaration shall require the Institutional
Trustee or Administrators to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder, or
in the exercise of any of their rights or powers if the Institutional Trustee or
such Administrator shall have reasonable grounds to believe that repayment of
such funds or adequate protection against such risk of liability is not
reasonably assured to the Institutional Trustee or such Administrator. Whether
or not therein expressly so provided, every provision of this Declaration
relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to
the Institutional Trustee or Administrators shall be subject to the provisions
of this Article. Nothing in this Declaration shall be construed to relieve an
Administrator or the Institutional Trustee from liability for the Institutional
Trustee's or such Administrator's own negligent act, the Institutional Trustee's
or such Administrator's own negligent failure to act, or the Institutional
Trustee's or such Administrator's own willful misconduct. To the extent that, at
law or in equity, the Institutional Trustee or an Administrator has duties and
liabilities relating to the Trust or to the Holders, the Institutional Trustee
or such Administrator shall not be liable to the Trust or to any Holder for the
Institutional Trustee's or such Administrator's good faith reliance on the
provisions of this Declaration. The provisions of this Declaration, to the
extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the Administrators or
the Institutional Trustee otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by
the Sponsor and the Holders to replace such other duties and liabilities of the
Administrators or the Institutional Trustee.

         (c) All payments made by the Institutional Trustee or a Paying Agent in
respect of the Securities shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from
the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue
or proceeds from the Trust Property to enable the Institutional Trustee or a
Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof. Each Holder,
by its acceptance of a Security, agrees that it will look solely to the revenue
and proceeds from the Trust Property to the extent legally available for
distribution to it as herein provided and that the Institutional Trustee and the
Administrators are not personally liable to it for any amount distributable in
respect of any Security or for any other liability in respect of any Security.
This Section 2.9(c) does not limit the liability of the Institutional Trustee
expressly set forth elsewhere in this Declaration.



                                       16
<PAGE>

         (d) The Institutional Trustee shall not be liable for its own acts or
omissions hereunder except as a result of its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

                  (i) the Institutional Trustee shall not be liable for any
         error of judgment made in good faith by an Authorized Officer of the
         Institutional Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Institutional
         Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

                  (ii) the Institutional Trustee shall not be liable with
         respect to any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
         in accordance with the direction of the Holders of not less than a
         Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities or the Common
         Securities, as applicable, relating to the time, method and place of
         conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional
         Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the
         Institutional Trustee under this Declaration;

                  (iii) the Institutional Trustee's sole duty with respect to
         the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the Debentures
         and the Property Account shall be to deal with such property in a
         similar manner as the Institutional Trustee deals with similar property
         for its fiduciary accounts generally, subject to the protections and
         limitations on liability afforded to the Institutional Trustee under
         this Declaration;

                  (iv) the Institutional Trustee shall not be liable for any
         interest on any money received by it except as it may otherwise agree
         in writing with the Sponsor; and money held by the Institutional
         Trustee need not be segregated from other funds held by it except in
         relation to the Property Account maintained by the Institutional
         Trustee pursuant to Section 2.8(c)(i) and except to the extent
         otherwise required by law; and

                  (v) the Institutional Trustee shall not be responsible for
         monitoring the compliance by the Administrators or the Sponsor with
         their respective duties under this Declaration, nor shall the
         Institutional Trustee be liable for any default or misconduct of the
         Administrators or the Sponsor.

         Section 2.10. Certain Rights of Institutional Trustee. Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.9:

         (a) the Institutional Trustee may conclusively rely and shall fully be
protected in acting, or refraining from acting, in good faith upon any
resolution, opinion of counsel, certificate, written representation of a Holder
or transferee, certificate of auditors or any other certificate, statement,
instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order,
appraisal, bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper
or document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or
presented by the proper party or parties;



                                       17
<PAGE>

         (b) if (i) in performing its duties under this Declaration, the
Institutional Trustee is required to decide between alternative courses of
action, (ii) in construing any of the provisions of this Declaration, the
Institutional Trustee finds the same ambiguous or inconsistent with any other
provisions contained herein, or (iii) the Institutional Trustee is unsure of the
application of any provision of this Declaration, then, except as to any matter
as to which the Holders of Capital Securities are entitled to vote under the
terms of this Declaration, the Institutional Trustee may deliver a notice to the
Sponsor requesting the Sponsor's written instructions as to the course of action
to be taken and the Institutional Trustee shall take such action, or refrain
from taking such action, as the Institutional Trustee shall be instructed in
writing, in which event the Institutional Trustee shall have no liability except
for its own negligence or willful misconduct;

         (c) any direction or act of the Sponsor or the Administrators
contemplated by this Declaration shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate;

         (d) whenever in the administration of this Declaration, the
Institutional Trustee shall deem it desirable that a matter be proved or
established before undertaking, suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the
Institutional Trustee (unless other evidence is herein specifically prescribed)
may request and conclusively rely upon an Officers' Certificate as to factual
matters which, upon receipt of such request, shall be promptly delivered by the
Sponsor or the Administrators;

         (e) the Institutional Trustee shall have no duty to see to any
recording, filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or
continuation statement or any filing under tax or securities laws) or any
rerecording, refiling or reregistration thereof;

         (f) the Institutional Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection
(which counsel may be counsel to the Sponsor or any of its Affiliates) and the
advice of such counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection
in respect of any action taken, suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good
faith and in reliance thereon and in accordance with such advice; the
Institutional Trustee shall have the right at any time to seek instructions
concerning the administration of this Declaration from any court of competent
jurisdiction;

         (g) the Institutional Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers vested in it by this Declaration at the request or
direction of any of the Holders pursuant to this Declaration, unless such
Holders shall have offered to the Institutional Trustee security or indemnity
reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction; provided,
that nothing contained in this Section 2.10(g) shall be taken to relieve the
Institutional Trustee, subject to Section 2.9(b), upon the occurrence of an
Event of Default (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.7),
from exercising such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Declaration,
and using the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent
person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his or
her own affairs;

         (h) the Institutional Trustee shall not be bound to make any
investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent, order,
approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper
or document, unless requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders, but
the Institutional Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation into
such facts or matters as it may see fit;



                                       18
<PAGE>

         (i) the Institutional Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through its
agents or attorneys and the Institutional Trustee shall not be responsible for
any misconduct or negligence on the part of or for the supervision of, any such
agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;

         (j) whenever in the administration of this Declaration the
Institutional Trustee shall deem it desirable to receive instructions with
respect to enforcing any remedy or right or taking any other action hereunder
the Institutional Trustee (i) may request instructions from the Holders of the
Capital Securities which instructions may only be given by the Holders of the
same proportion in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities as would be
entitled to direct the Institutional Trustee under the terms of the Capital
Securities in respect of such remedy, right or action, (ii) may refrain from
enforcing such remedy or right or taking such other action until such
instructions are received, and (iii) shall be fully protected in acting in
accordance with such instructions;

         (k) except as otherwise expressly provided in this Declaration, the
Institutional Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that
is discretionary under the provisions of this Declaration;

         (l) when the Institutional Trustee incurs expenses or renders services
in connection with a Bankruptcy Event, such expenses (including the fees and
expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such services are intended to
constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy law or law relating
to creditors rights generally;

         (m) the Institutional Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of an
Event of Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Institutional Trustee
obtains actual knowledge of such event or the Institutional Trustee receives
written notice of such event from any Holder, the Sponsor or the Debenture
Trustee;

         (n) any action taken by the Institutional Trustee or its agents
hereunder shall bind the Trust and the Holders of the Securities, and the
signature of the Institutional Trustee or its agents alone shall be sufficient
and effective to perform any such action and no third party shall be required to
inquire as to the authority of the Institutional Trustee to so act or as to its
compliance with any of the terms and provisions of this Declaration, both of
which shall be conclusively evidenced by the Institutional Trustee's or its
agent's taking such action; and

         (o) no provision of this Declaration shall be deemed to impose any duty
or obligation on the Institutional Trustee to perform any act or acts or
exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any
jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Institutional Trustee
shall be unqualified or incompetent in accordance with applicable law, to
perform any such act or acts, or to exercise any such right, power, duty or
obligation. No permissive power or authority available to the Institutional
Trustee shall be construed to be a duty.

         Section 2.11. Execution of Documents. Unless otherwise determined in
writing by the Institutional Trustee, and except as otherwise required by the
Statutory Trust Act, the Institutional Trustee, or any one or more of the
Administrators, as the case may be, is authorized to execute on behalf of the

case may be, have the power and authority to execute pursuant to Section 2.6.

pursuant to the provisions of Article VII hereof, shall be in existence for 35
years from the Closing Date.

         Section 2.14. Mergers.

         (a) The Trust may not consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or
be replaced by, or convey, transfer or lease its properties and assets
substantially as an entirety to any corporation or other body, except as
described in Sections 2.14(b) and (c) and except in connection with the
liquidation of the Trust and the distribution of the Debentures to Holders of
Securities pursuant to Section 7.1(a)(iv) of the Declaration or Section 4 of
Annex I.

         (b) The Trust may, with the consent of the Institutional Trustee and
without the consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities, consolidate,
amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by a trust organized as such
under the laws of any state; provided that:

         (c) if the Trust is not the surviving entity, such successor entity
(the "Successor Entity") either:

                           (A) expressly assumes all of the obligations of the
                  Trust under the Securities; or

                           (B) substitutes for the Securities other securities
                  having substantially the same terms as the Securities (the
                  "Successor Securities") so that the Successor Securities rank
                  the same as the Securities rank with respect to Distributions
                  and payments upon Liquidation, redemption and otherwise;

                  (ii) the Sponsor expressly appoints a trustee of the Successor
         Entity that possesses substantially the same powers and duties as the
         Institutional Trustee as the Holder of the Debentures;

                  (iii) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or replacement
         does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the
         Holders of the Securities (including any Successor Securities) in any
         material respect;

                  (iv) the Institutional Trustee receives written confirmation
         from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization that rates
         securities issued by the initial purchaser of the Capital Securities
         that it will not reduce or withdraw the rating of any such securities
         because of such merger, conversion, consolidation, amalgamation or
         replacement;



                                       20
<PAGE>


                  (v) such Successor Entity has a purpose substantially
         identical to that of the Trust;

                  (vi) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
         replacement, the Trust has received an opinion of a nationally
         recognized independent counsel to the Trust experienced in such matters
         to the effect that:

                           (A) such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
                  replacement does not adversely affect the rights, preferences
                  and privileges of the Holders of the Securities (including any
                  Successor Securities) in any material respect;

                           (B) following such merger, consolidation,
                  amalgamation or replacement, neither the Trust nor the
                  Successor Entity will be required to register as an Investment
                  Company; and

                           (C) following such merger, consolidation,
                  amalgamation or replacement, the Trust (or the Successor
                  Entity) will continue to be classified as a "grantor trust"
                  for United States federal income tax purposes;

                  (vii) the Sponsor guarantees the obligations of such Successor
         Entity under the Successor Securities at least to the extent provided
         by the Guarantee;

                  (viii) the Sponsor owns 100% of the common securities of any
         Successor Entity; and

                  (ix) prior to such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or
         replacement, the Institutional Trustee shall have received an Officers'
         Certificate of the Administrators and an opinion of counsel, each to
         the effect that all conditions precedent under this Section 2.14(c) to
         such transaction have been satisfied.

         (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.14(c), the Trust shall not, except with
the consent of Holders of 100% in aggregate liquidation amount of the
Securities, consolidate, amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by any
other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate, amalgamate, merge with
or into, or replace it if such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or
replacement would cause the Trust or Successor Entity to be classified as other
than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                                     SPONSOR

         Section 3.1. Sponsor's Purchase of Common Securities. On the Closing
Date, the Sponsor will purchase all of the Common Securities issued by the Trust

         Section 3.2. Responsibilities of the Sponsor. In connection with the
issue and sale of the Capital Securities, the Sponsor shall have the exclusive
right and responsibility to engage in, or direct the Administrators to engage
in, the following activities:

         (a) to determine the States in which to take appropriate action to
qualify or register for sale all or part of the Capital Securities and to do any
and all such acts, other than actions which must be taken by the Trust, and
advise the Trust of actions it must take, and prepare for execution and filing
any documents to be executed and filed by the Trust, as the Sponsor deems
necessary or advisable in order to comply with the applicable laws of any such
States; and

         (b) to negotiate the terms of and/or execute on behalf of the Trust,
the Placement Agreement and other related agreements providing for the sale of
the Capital Securities.

         Section 3.3. Expenses. In connection with the offering, sale and
issuance of the Debentures to the Trust and in connection with the sale of the
Securities by the Trust, the Sponsor, in its capacity as Debenture Issuer,
shall:

         (a) pay all reasonable costs and expenses relating to the offering,
sale and issuance of the Debentures, including compensation of the Debenture
Trustee under the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture;

         (b) be responsible for and shall pay all debts and obligations (other
than with respect to the Securities) and all costs and expenses of the Trust
(including, but not limited to, costs and expenses relating to the organization,
maintenance and dissolution of the Trust), the offering, sale and issuance of
the Securities (including reasonable fees to the placement agents in connection
therewith), the reasonable fees and expenses (including reasonable counsel fees

of the Holders; and

         (c) pay any and all taxes (other than United States withholding taxes
attributable to the Trust or its assets) and all liabilities, costs and expenses
with respect to such taxes of the Trust.

         The Sponsor's obligations under this Section 3.3 shall be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, any Person to whom such debts,
obligations, costs, expenses and taxes are owed (a "Creditor") whether or not
such Creditor has received notice hereof. Any such Creditor may enforce the
Sponsor's obligations under this Section 3.3 directly against the Sponsor and
the Sponsor irrevocably waives any right or remedy to require that any such
Creditor take any action against the Trust or any other Person before proceeding
against the Sponsor. The Sponsor agrees to execute such additional agreements as
may be necessary or desirable in order to give full effect to the provisions of
this Section 3.3.

         Section 4.1. Institutional Trustee; Eligibility.

         (a) There shall at all times be one Institutional Trustee which shall:

                  (i) not be an Affiliate of the Sponsor;

                  (ii) not offer or provide credit or credit enhancement to the
         Trust; and

                  (iii) be a banking corporation or trust company organized and

         state thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws
         to exercise corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and
         surplus of at least 50 million U.S. dollars ($50,000,000.00), and
         subject to supervision or examination by Federal, state, or District of
         Columbia authority. If such corporation publishes reports of condition
         at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the
         supervising or examining authority referred to above, then for the
         purposes of this Section 4.1(a(iii), the combined capital and surplus
         of such corporation shall be deemed to be its combined capital and
         surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so
         published.

         (b) If at any time the Institutional Trustee shall cease to be eligible
to so act under Section 4.1(a), the Institutional Trustee shall immediately
resign in the manner and with the effect set forth in Section 4.3(a).

         (c) If the Institutional Trustee has or shall acquire any "conflicting
interest" within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act of
1939, as amended, the Institutional Trustee shall either eliminate such interest
or resign, to the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to this
Declaration.

         (d) The initial Institutional Trustee shall be U.S. Bank National
Association.

         Section 4.2. Administrators. Each Administrator shall be a U.S. Person,
21 years of age or older and authorized to bind the Sponsor. The initial
Administrators shall be John Modin, Bruce Byrnes and Jeff Jeffreys. There shall
at all times be at least two Administrators. Except where a requirement for
action by a specific number of Administrators is expressly set forth in this
Declaration and except with respect to any action the taking of which is the
subject of a meeting of the Administrators, any action required or permitted to
be taken by the Administrators may be taken by, and any power of the
Administrators may be exercised by, or with the consent of, any one such
Administrator.

         Section 4.3. Appointment, Removal and Resignation of Institutional
Trustee and Administrators.

         (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Declaration, no
resignation or removal of the Institutional Trustee and no appointment of a
Successor Institutional Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective
until the acceptance of appointment by the Successor Institutional Trustee in
accordance with the applicable requirements of this Section 4.3.

         Subject to the immediately preceding paragraph, the Institutional
Trustee may resign at any time by giving written notice thereof to the Holders
of the Securities and by appointing a Successor Institutional Trustee. Upon the
resignation of the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional Trustee shall
appoint a successor by requesting from at least three Persons meeting the
eligibility requirements its expenses and charges to serve as the successor
Institutional Trustee on a form provided by the Administrators, and selecting
the Person who agrees to the lowest expense and charges (the "Successor
Institutional Trustee"). If the instrument of acceptance by the Successor
Institutional Trustee required by this Section 4.3 shall not have been delivered
to the Institutional Trustee within 60 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation, the Institutional Trustee may petition, at the expense of the
Trust, any Federal, state or District of Columbia court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a Successor Institutional Trustee. Such
court may thereupon, after prescribing such notice, if any, as it may deem
proper, appoint a Successor Institutional Trustee. The Institutional Trustee
shall have no liability for the selection of such successor pursuant to this
Section 4.3.

         The Institutional Trustee may be removed by the act of the Holders of a
Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, delivered to the
Institutional Trustee (in its individual capacity and on behalf of the Trust) if
an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. If the Institutional
Trustee shall be so removed, the Holders of Capital Securities, by act of the
Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities then
outstanding delivered to the Institutional Trustee, shall promptly appoint a
Successor Institutional Trustee, and such Successor Institutional Trustee shall
comply with the applicable requirements of this Section 4.3. If no Successor
Institutional Trustee shall have been so appointed by the Holders of a Majority
in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities and accepted appointment in the
manner required by this Section 4.3, within 30 days after delivery of an
instrument of removal, any Holder who has been a Holder of the Securities for at
least 6 months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated,
petition any Federal, state or District of Columbia court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of the Successor Institutional Trustee. Such
court may thereupon, after prescribing such notice, if any, as it may deem
proper, appoint a Successor Institutional Trustee.

         The Institutional Trustee shall give notice of its resignation or
removal and each appointment of a Successor Institutional Trustee to all Holders
in the manner provided in Section 13.1(d) and shall give notice to the Sponsor.
Each notice shall include the name of the Successor Institutional Trustee and
the address of its Corporate Trust Office.



                                       24

         (b) In case of the appointment hereunder of a Successor Institutional
Trustee, the retiring Institutional Trustee and the Successor Institutional
Trustee shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein the Successor
Institutional Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (i) shall contain
such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and confirm to,
and to vest in, the Successor Institutional Trustee all the rights, powers,
trusts and duties of the retiring Institutional Trustee with respect to the
Securities and the Trust and (ii) shall add to or change any of the provisions
of this Declaration as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the
administration of the Trust by more than one Institutional Trustee, it being
understood that nothing herein or in such amendment shall constitute such
Institutional Trustees co-trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such
amendment the resignation or removal of the retiring Institutional Trustee shall
become effective to the extent provided therein and each Successor Institutional
Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with
all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Institutional Trustee;
but, on request of the Trust or any Successor Institutional Trustee such
retiring Institutional Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such
Successor Institutional Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and
money held by such retiring Institutional Trustee hereunder with respect to the
Securities and the Trust.

         (c) No Institutional Trustee shall be liable for the acts or omissions
to act of any Successor Institutional Trustee.

         (d) The Holders of the Capital Securities will have no right to vote to
appoint, remove or replace the Administrators, which voting rights are vested
exclusively in the Holder of the Common Securities.

         Section 4.4. Institutional Trustee Vacancies. If the Institutional
Trustee ceases to hold office for any reason a vacancy shall occur. A resolution
certifying the existence of such vacancy by the Institutional Trustee shall be
conclusive evidence of the existence of such vacancy. The vacancy shall be
filled with a trustee appointed in accordance with Section 4.3.

         Section 4.5. Effect of Vacancies. The death, resignation, retirement,
removal, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation, incompetence or incapacity to
perform the duties of the Institutional Trustee shall not operate to dissolve,
terminate or annul the Trust or terminate this Declaration.

         Section 4.6. Meetings of the Institutional Trustee and the
Administrators. Meetings of the Administrators shall be held from time to time
upon the call of an Administrator. Regular meetings of the Administrators may be
held in person in the United States or by telephone, at a place (if applicable)
and time fixed by resolution of the Administrators. Notice of any in-person
meetings of the Institutional Trustee with the Administrators or meetings of the
Administrators shall be hand delivered or otherwise delivered in writing
(including by facsimile, with a hard copy by overnight courier) not less than 48
hours before such meeting. Notice of any telephonic meetings of the
Institutional Trustee with the Administrators or meetings of the Administrators
or any committee thereof shall be hand delivered or otherwise delivered in
writing (including by facsimile, with a hard copy by overnight courier) not less
than 24 hours before a meeting. Notices shall contain a brief statement of the
time, place and anticipated purposes of the meeting. The presence (whether in
person or by telephone) of the Institutional Trustee or an Administrator, as the
case may be, at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting
except where the Institutional Trustee or an Administrator, as the case may be,



                                       25
<PAGE>


attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
activity on the grounds that the meeting has not been lawfully called or
convened. Unless provided otherwise in this Declaration, any action of the
Institutional Trustee or the Administrators, as the case may be, may be taken at
a meeting by vote of the Institutional Trustee or a majority vote of the
Administrators present (whether in person or by telephone) and eligible to vote
with respect to such matter, provided that a Quorum is present, or without a
meeting by the unanimous written consent of the Institutional Trustee or the
Administrators. Meetings of the Institutional Trustee and the Administrators
together shall be held from time to time upon the call of the Institutional
Trustee or an Administrator.

         Section 4.7. Delegation of Power.

         (a) Any Administrator may, by power of attorney consistent with
applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 that is
a U.S. Person his or her power for the purpose of executing any documents
contemplated in Section 2.6; and

         (b) the Administrators shall have power to delegate from time to time
to such of their number the doing of such things and the execution of such
instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of the Administrators
or otherwise as the Administrators may deem expedient, to the extent such
delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of
the Trust, as set forth herein.

         Section 4.8. Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to Business. Any
Person into which the Institutional Trustee may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Institutional Trustee shall be a party,
or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust
business of the Institutional Trustee shall be the successor of the
Institutional Trustee hereunder, provided such Person shall be otherwise
qualified and eligible under this Article, without the execution or filing of
any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto.

                                   ARTICLE V.

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

         Section 5.1. Distributions. Holders shall receive Distributions in
accordance with the applicable terms of the relevant Holder's Securities.
Distributions shall be made on the Capital Securities and the Common Securities
in accordance with the preferences set forth in their respective terms. If and
to the extent that the Debenture Issuer makes a payment of Interest or any
principal on the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional
Trustee shall and is directed to, to the extent funds are available for that
purpose, make a distribution (a "Distribution") of such amounts to Holders.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                             ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES

         Section 6.1. General Provisions Regarding Securities.

         (a) The Administrators shall, on behalf of the Trust, issue one series
of capital securities substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 representing
undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust having such terms as
are set forth in Annex I and one series of common securities representing
undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the Trust having such terms as
are set forth in Annex I. The Trust shall issue no securities or other interests
in the assets of the Trust other than the Capital Securities and the Common
Securities. The Capital Securities rank pari passu to, and payment thereon shall
be made Pro Rata with, the Common Securities except that, where an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the rights of Holders of the Common
Securities to payment in respect of Distributions and payments upon liquidation,
redemption and otherwise are subordinated to the rights to payment of the
Holders of the Capital Securities as set forth in Annex I.

         (b) The Certificates shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by one or
more Administrators. Such signature shall be the facsimile or manual signature
of any Administrator. In case any Administrator of the Trust who shall have
signed any of the Securities shall cease to be such Administrator before the
Certificates so signed shall be delivered by the Trust, such Certificates
nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such Certificates
had not ceased to be such Administrator, and any Certificate may be signed on
behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such
Security, shall be an Administrator of the Trust, although at the date of the
execution and delivery of the Declaration any such person was not such an
Administrator. A Capital Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the
facsimile or manual signature of an Authorized Officer of the Institutional
Trustee. Such signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Capital Security
has been authenticated under this Declaration. Upon written order of the Trust
signed by one Administrator, the Institutional Trustee shall authenticate the
Capital Securities for original issue. The Institutional Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent that is a U.S. Person acceptable to the Trust to
authenticate the Capital Securities. A Common Security need not be so
authenticated.

         (c) The consideration received by the Trust for the issuance of the
Securities shall constitute a contribution to the capital of the Trust and shall
not constitute a loan to the Trust.

         (d) Upon issuance of the Securities as provided in this Declaration,
the Securities so issued shall be deemed to be validly issued, fully paid and,
except as provided in Section 9.1(b) with respect to the Common Securities,
non-assessable.

         (e) Every Person, by virtue of having become a Holder in accordance
with the terms of this Declaration, shall be deemed to have expressly assented
and agreed to the terms of, and shall be bound by, this Declaration and the
Guarantee.



                                       27

         Section 6.2. Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar. The Trust
shall maintain in Hartford, Connecticut, an office or agency where the Capital
Securities may be presented for payment ("Paying Agent"), and an office or
agency where Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or
exchange (the "Transfer Agent"). The Trust shall keep or cause to be kept at
such office or agency a register for the purpose of registering Securities,
transfers and exchanges of Securities, such register to be held by a registrar
(the "Registrar"). The Administrators may appoint the Paying Agent, the
Registrar and the Transfer Agent and may appoint one or more additional Paying
Agents or one or more co-Registrars, or one or more co-Transfer Agents in such
other locations as they shall determine. The term "Paying Agent" includes any
additional paying agent, the term "Registrar" includes any additional registrar
or co-Registrar and the term "Transfer Agent" includes any additional transfer
agent. The Administrators may change any Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or
Registrar at any time without prior notice to any Holder. The Administrators
shall notify the Institutional Trustee of the name and address of any Paying
Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar not a party to this Declaration. The
Administrators hereby initially appoint the Institutional Trustee to act as
Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar for the Capital Securities and the
Common Securities. The Institutional Trustee or any of its Affiliates in the
United States may act as Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.

         Section 6.3. Form and Dating. The Capital Securities and the
Institutional Trustee's certificate of authentication thereon shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1, and the Common Securities shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2, each of which is hereby incorporated
in and expressly made a part of this Declaration. Certificates may be typed,
printed, lithographed or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is
reasonably acceptable to the Administrators, as conclusively evidenced by their
execution thereof. The Securities may have letters, numbers, notations or other
marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements required
by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to which the Trust is subject if any, or
usage (provided that any such notation, legend or endorsement is in a form
acceptable to the Sponsor). The Trust at the direction of the Sponsor shall
furnish any such legend not contained in Exhibit A-1 to the Institutional
Trustee in writing. Each Capital Security shall be dated on or before the date
of its authentication. The terms and provisions of the Securities set forth in
Annex I and the forms of Securities set forth in Exhibits A-1 and A-2 are part
of the terms of this Declaration and to the extent applicable, the Institutional
Trustee, the Administrators and the Sponsor, by their execution and delivery of
this Declaration, expressly agree to such terms and provisions and to be bound
thereby. Capital Securities will be issued only in blocks having a stated
liquidation amount of not less than $100,000.00 and any multiple of $1,000.00 in
excess thereof.

         The Capital Securities are being offered and sold by the Trust pursuant
to the Placement Agreement in definitive, registered form without coupons and
with the Restricted Securities Legend.

         Section 6.4. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Certificates.

         If:

         (a) any mutilated Certificates should be surrendered to the Registrar,
or if the Registrar shall receive evidence to its satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate; and



                                       28
<PAGE>

         (b) there shall be delivered to the Registrar, the Administrators and
the Institutional Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to keep each of them harmless;

then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by
a protected purchaser, an Administrator on behalf of the Trust shall execute
(and in the case of a Capital Security Certificate, the Institutional Trustee
shall authenticate) and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate of like
denomination. In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this
Section 6.4, the Registrar or the Administrators may require the payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this
Section shall constitute conclusive evidence of an ownership interest in the
relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

         Section 6.5. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are
ready for delivery, the Administrators may prepare and, in the case of the
Capital Securities, the Institutional Trustee shall authenticate, temporary
Securities. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of
definitive Securities but may have variations that the Administrators consider
appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the
Administrators shall prepare and, in the case of the Capital Securities, the
Institutional Trustee shall authenticate, definitive Securities in exchange for
temporary Securities.

         Section 6.6. Cancellation. The Administrators at any time may deliver
Securities to the Institutional Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar shall
forward to the Institutional Trustee any Securities surrendered to it for
registration of transfer, redemption or payment. The Institutional Trustee shall
promptly cancel all Securities surrendered for registration of transfer,
payment, replacement or cancellation and shall dispose of such canceled
Securities as the Administrators direct. The Administrators may not issue new
Securities to replace Securities that have been paid or that have been delivered
to the Institutional Trustee for cancellation.

         Section 6.7. Rights of Holders; Waivers of Past Defaults.

         (a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the
Institutional Trustee (in its capacity as such) subject to Section 2.5, and the
Holders shall not have any right or title therein other than the undivided
beneficial interest in the assets of the Trust conferred by their Securities and
they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of property,
profits or rights of the Trust except as described below. The Securities shall
be personal property giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and
in this Declaration. The Securities shall have no preemptive or similar rights.

         (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain outstanding, if upon
an Indenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not
less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Debentures fail to declare
the principal of all of the Debentures to be immediately due and payable, the
Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities then
outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing
to the Institutional Trustee, the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee.



                                       29
<PAGE>

         At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the
Debentures has been made and before a judgment or decree for payment of the
money due has been obtained by the Debenture Trustee as provided in the
Indenture, if the Institutional Trustee, subject to the provisions hereof, fails
to annul any such declaration and waive such default, the Holders of a Majority
in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities, by written notice to the
Institutional Trustee, the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee, may rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if:

                  (i) the Debenture Issuer has paid or deposited with the
         Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

                           (A) all overdue installments of interest on all of
                  the Debentures,

                           (B) any accrued Additional Interest on all of the
                  Debentures,

                           (C) the principal of (and premium, if any, on) any
                  Debentures that have become due otherwise than by such
                  declaration of acceleration and interest and Additional
                  Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and

                           (D) all sums paid or advanced by the Debenture
                  Trustee under the Indenture and the reasonable compensation,
                  expenses, disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee
                  and the Institutional Trustee, their agents and counsel; and

                  (ii) all Events of Default with respect to the Debentures,
         other than the non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has
         become due solely by such acceleration, have been cured or waived as
         provided in Section 5.7 of the Indenture.

         The Holders of at least a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities, waive
any past default under the Indenture or any Indenture Event of Default, except a
default or Indenture Event of Default in the payment of principal or interest on
the Debentures (unless such default or Indenture Event of Default has been cured
and a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest and principal
due otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture
Trustee) or a default under the Indenture or an Indenture Event of Default in
respect of a covenant or provision that under the Indenture cannot be modified
or amended without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture. No
such rescission shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

         Upon receipt by the Institutional Trustee of written notice declaring
such an acceleration, or rescission and annulment thereof, by Holders of any
part of the Capital Securities, a record date shall be established for
determining Holders of outstanding Capital Securities entitled to join in such
notice, which record date shall be at the close of business on the day the
Institutional Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or
their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons, shall be entitled to join
in such notice, whether or not such Holders remain Holders after such record
date; provided, that unless such declaration of acceleration, or rescission and
annulment, as the case may be, shall have become effective by virtue of the
requisite percentage having joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90
days after such record



                                       30
<PAGE>


date, such notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and annulment,
as the case may be, shall automatically and without further action by any Holder
be canceled and of no further effect. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a
Holder, or a proxy of a Holder, from giving, after expiration of such 90-day
period, a new written notice of declaration of acceleration, or rescission and
annulment thereof, as the case may be, that is identical to a written notice
that has been canceled pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, in
which event a new record date shall be established pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 6.7.

         (c) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this
Section 6.7, the Holders of at least a Majority in liquidation amount of the
Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital Securities,
waive any past default or Event of Default and its consequences. Upon such
waiver, any such default or Event of Default shall cease to exist, and any
default or Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
cured, for every purpose of this Declaration, but no such waiver shall extend to
any subsequent or other default or Event of Default or impair any right
consequent thereon.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                      DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION OF TRUST

         of the term of the Trust;

                  (ii) upon a Bankruptcy Event with respect to the Sponsor, the
         Trust or the Debenture Issuer;

                  (iii) (other than in connection with a merger, consolidation
         or similar transaction not prohibited by the Indenture, this
         Declaration or the Guarantee, as the case may be) upon (A) the filing
         of a certificate of dissolution or its equivalent with respect to the
         Sponsor, and (B)(I) upon the consent of Holders of a Majority in
         liquidation amount of the Securities voting together as a single class
         to file a certificate of cancellation with respect to the Trust or (II)
         upon the revocation of the charter of the Sponsor and the expiration of
         90 days after the date of revocation without a reinstatement thereof;

                  (iv) upon the distribution of the Debentures to the Holders of
         the Securities in accordance with Section 3 of Annex I;

         outstanding Common Securities to dissolve the Trust as provided in
         Annex I hereto;

                  (vi) upon the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the
         Holder of the Common Securities, the Sponsor, the Trust or the
         Debenture Issuer;

<PAGE>

                  (vii) when all of the Securities shall have been called for
         redemption and the amounts necessary for redemption thereof shall have
         been paid to the Holders in accordance with the terms of the
         Securities; or

                  (viii) before the issuance of any Securities, with the consent
         of the Institutional Trustee and the Sponsor.

         (b) As soon as is practicable after the occurrence of an event referred
to in Section 7.1(a), and after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the
Trust as required by applicable law, including of the Statutory Trust Act, and
subject to the terms set forth in Annex I, the Institutional Trustee shall
terminate the Trust by filing a certificate of cancellation with the Secretary
of the State of the State of Connecticut.

         (c) The provisions of Section 2.9 and Article IX shall survive the
termination of the Trust.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                              TRANSFER OF INTERESTS

         Section 8.1. General.

         (a) Subject to Section 8.1(c), where Capital Securities are presented
to the Registrar or a co-registrar with a request to register a transfer or to
exchange them for an equal number of Capital Securities represented by different
certificates, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if
its requirements for such transactions are met. To permit registrations of
transfer and exchanges, the Trust shall issue and the Institutional Trustee
shall authenticate Capital Securities at the Registrar's request.

         (b) Upon issuance of the Common Securities, the Sponsor shall acquire
and retain beneficial and record ownership of the Common Securities and for so
long as the Securities remain outstanding, the Sponsor shall maintain 100%
ownership of the Common Securities; provided, however, that any permitted
successor of the Sponsor, in its capacity as Debenture Issuer, under the
Indenture that is a U.S. Person may succeed to the Sponsor's ownership of the
Common Securities.

         (c) Securities may only be transferred, in whole or in part, in
accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Declaration and in
the terms of the Securities. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law,
any transfer or purported transfer of any Security not made in accordance with
this Declaration shall be null and void and will be deemed to be of no legal
effect whatsoever and any such transferee shall be deemed not to be the holder
of such Securities for any purpose, including but not limited to the receipt of
Distributions on such Securities, and such transferee shall be deemed to have no
interest whatsoever in such Securities.

         (d) The Registrar shall provide for the registration of Securities and
of transfers of Securities, which will be effected without charge but only upon
payment (with such indemnity as the Registrar may require) in respect of any tax
or other governmental charges that may be imposed in relation to it. Upon
surrender for registration of transfer of any Securities, the Registrar shall
cause one or more new Securities of the same tenor to be issued in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees. Every Security surrendered for
registration of transfer shall be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Registrar duly executed by the Holder or
such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing. Each Security surrendered for
registration of transfer shall be canceled by the Institutional Trustee pursuant
to Section 6.6. A transferee of a Security shall be entitled to the rights and
subject to the obligations of a Holder hereunder upon the receipt by such
transferee of a Security. By acceptance of a Security, each transferee shall be
deemed to have agreed to be bound by this Declaration.

         (e) The Trust shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer
of, or exchange any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of any selection of Securities for redemption
and ending at the close of business on the earliest date on which the relevant
notice of redemption is deemed to have been given to all Holders of the
Securities to be redeemed, or (ii) to register the transfer or exchange of any
Security so selected for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed
portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

         Section 8.2. Transfer Procedures and Restrictions.

         (a) The Capital Securities shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend,
which shall not be removed unless there is delivered to the Trust such
satisfactory evidence, which may include an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
the Institutional Trustee, as may be reasonably required by the Trust, that
neither the legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth therein are
required to ensure that transfers thereof comply with the provisions of the
Securities Act. Upon provision of such satisfactory evidence, the Institutional
Trustee, at the written direction of the Trust, shall authenticate and deliver
Capital Securities that do not bear the legend.

         (b) Except as permitted by Section 8.2(a), each Capital Security shall
bear a legend (the "Restricted Securities Legend") in substantially the
following form and a Capital Security shall not be transferred except in
compliance with such legend, unless otherwise determined by the Sponsor, upon
the advice of counsel expert in securities law, in accordance with applicable
law:

                  THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
         SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"),

         WITH, ANY DISTRIBUTION IN VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT, OR
         (F) PURSUANT TO ANY OTHER AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM THE
         REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT, SUBJECT TO
         THE SPONSOR'S AND THE TRUST'S RIGHT PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER,
         SALE OR TRANSFER TO REQUIRE THE DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF
         COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION SATISFACTORY

         TRUST. HEDGING TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING THIS SECURITY MAY NOT
         BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT.

                  THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF
         ALSO AGREES, REPRESENTS AND WARRANTS THAT IT IS NOT AN

         REPRESENTED BY ITS PURCHASE AND HOLDING THEREOF THAT EITHER
         (i) IT IS NOT AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN WITHIN THE MEANING OF
         SECTION 3(3) OF ERISA, OR A PLAN TO WHICH SECTION 4975 OF THE
         CODE IS APPLICABLE, A TRUSTEE OR OTHER PERSON ACTING ON
         BEHALF OF AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN OR PLAN, OR ANY OTHER
         PERSON OR ENTITY USING THE ASSETS OF ANY EMPLOYEE BENEFIT
         PLAN OR PLAN TO FINANCE SUCH PURCHASE, OR (ii) SUCH PURCHASE
         WILL NOT RESULT IN A PROHIBITED TRANSACTION UNDER SECTION 406
         OF ERISA OR SECTION 4975 OF THE CODE FOR WHICH THERE IS NO

         $100,000.00 (100 SECURITIES) AND MULTIPLES OF $1,000.00 IN

         BLOCK HAVING A LIQUIDATION AMOUNT OF LESS THAN $100,000.00
         SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE VOID AND OF NO LEGAL EFFECT WHATSOEVER.

                  THIS SECURITY IS IN REGISTERED FORM WITHIN THE
         MEANING OF TREASURY REGULATIONS SECTION 1.871-14(c)(1)(i) FOR
         U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND WITHHOLDING TAX PURPOSES.

                  THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY AGREES THAT IT WILL
         COMPLY WITH THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS.

                  IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER, THE HOLDER WILL
         DELIVER TO THE REGISTRAR AND TRANSFER AGENT SUCH CERTIFICATES
         AND OTHER INFORMATION AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY THE DECLARATION

exchange.

         Section 8.3. Deemed Security Holders. The Trust, the Administrators,
the Institutional Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar
may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate shall be registered on the
books and records of the Trust as the sole holder of such Certificate and of the
Securities represented by such Certificate for purposes of receiving
Distributions and for all other purposes whatsoever and, accordingly, shall not
be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
Certificate or in the Securities represented by such Certificate on the part of
any Person, whether or not the Trust, the Administrators, the Institutional
Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar shall have actual
or other notice thereof

                           LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
             HOLDERS OF SECURITIES, INSTITUTIONAL TRUSTEE OR OTHERS

         Section 9.1. Liability.

         (a) Except as expressly set forth in this Declaration, the Guarantee
and the terms of the Securities, the Sponsor shall not be:

                  (i) personally liable for the return of any portion of the
         capital contributions (or any return thereon) of the Holders of the
         Securities which shall be made solely from assets of the Trust; or

                  (ii) required to pay to the Trust or to any Holder of the
         Securities any deficit upon dissolution of the Trust or otherwise.

         (b) The Holder of the Common Securities shall be liable for all of the
debts and obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to the Securities)
to the extent not satisfied out of the Trust's assets.

         (c) Pursuant to the Statutory Trust Act, the Holders of the Securities
shall be entitled to the same limitation of personal liability extended to
stockholders of private corporations for profit organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Connecticut.

         Section 9.2. Exculpation.

         (a) No Indemnified Person shall be liable, responsible or accountable
in damages or otherwise to the Trust or any Covered Person for any loss, damage
or claim incurred by reason of any act or omission performed or omitted by such
Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a manner such
Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope of the authority
conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Declaration or by law, except that
an Indemnified Person shall be liable for any such loss, damage or claim
incurred by reason of such Indemnified Person's negligence or willful misconduct
with respect to such acts or omissions.

         (b) An Indemnified Person shall be fully protected in relying in good
faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports
or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified
Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert
competence and, if selected by such Indemnified Person, has been selected by
such Indemnified Person with reasonable care by or on behalf of the Trust,
including information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and
amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses, or any other facts pertinent
to the existence and amount of assets from which Distributions to Holders of
Securities might properly be paid.

         Section 9.3. Fiduciary Duty.

         (a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified Person has
duties (including fiduciary duties) and liabilities relating thereto to the
Trust or to any other Covered Person, an Indemnified Person acting under this
Declaration shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other Covered Person for
its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. The provisions of
this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of
an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the
parties hereto to replace such other duties and liabilities of the Indemnified
Person.

         (b) Whenever in this Declaration an Indemnified Person is permitted or
required to make a decision:

                  (i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority,
         the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and
         factors as it desires, including its own interests, and shall have no
         duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of or
         factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or

                  (ii) in its "good faith" or under another express standard,
         the Indemnified Person shall act under such express standard and shall
         not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by this
         Declaration or by applicable law.

         Section 9.4. Indemnification.

         (a) The Sponsor shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law,
any Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in
the right of the Trust) arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of this Declaration by reason of the fact that he is or was an
Indemnified Person against expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if
he acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order,
settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent,
shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the Indemnified Person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Trust, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that his conduct was
unlawful.

         (b) The Sponsor shall indemnify, to the full extent permitted by law,
any Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
Trust to procure a judgment in its favor arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of this Declaration by reason of the fact that
he is or was an Indemnified Person against expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Trust; provided, however, that no such indemnification
shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such
Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and
only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.


                                       37
<PAGE>

         (c) To the extent that an Indemnified Person shall be successful on the
merits or otherwise (including dismissal of an action without prejudice or the
settlement of an action without admission of liability) in defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section
9.4, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, he shall be
indemnified, to the full extent permitted by law, against expenses (including
attorneys' fees and expenses) actually and reasonably incurred by him in
connection therewith.

         (d) Any indemnification of an Administrator under paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 9.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Sponsor
only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that
indemnification of the Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because
he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs (a) and
(b). Such determination shall be made (i) by the Administrators by a majority
vote of a Quorum consisting of such Administrators who were not parties to such
action, suit or proceeding, (ii) if such a Quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
obtainable, if a Quorum of disinterested Administrators so directs, by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (iii) by the Common Security
Holder of the Trust.

         (e) To the fullest extent permitted by law, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by an Indemnified Person in
defending a civil, criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit or
proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 shall be
paid by the Sponsor in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or
proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified
Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not
entitled to be indemnified by the Sponsor as authorized in this Section 9.4.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no advance shall be made by the Sponsor if a
determination is reasonably and promptly made (i) by the Administrators by a
majority vote of a Quorum of disinterested Administrators, (ii) if such a Quorum
is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested
Administrators so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion or
(iii) by the Common Security Holder of the Trust, that, based upon the facts
known to the Administrators, counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time
such determination is made, such Indemnified Person acted in bad faith or in a
manner that such Indemnified Person did not believe to be in the best interests
of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Indemnified
Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful. In
no event shall any advance be made in instances where the Administrators,
independent legal counsel or the Common Security Holder reasonably determine
that such Indemnified Person deliberately breached his duty to the Trust or its
Common or Capital Security Holders.


                                       38
<PAGE>

         (f) The Institutional Trustee, at the sole cost and expense of the
Sponsor, retains the right to representation by counsel of its own choosing in
any action, suit or any other proceeding for which it is indemnified under
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4, without affecting its right to
indemnification hereunder or waiving any rights afforded to it under this
Declaration or applicable law.

         (g) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, the other paragraphs of this Section 9.4 shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification and
advancement of expenses may be entitled under any agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors of the Sponsor or Capital Security
Holders of the Trust or otherwise, both as to action in his official capacity
and as to action in another capacity while holding such office. All rights to
indemnification under this Section 9.4 shall be deemed to be provided by a
contract between the Sponsor and each Indemnified Person who serves in such
capacity at any time while this Section 9.4 is in effect. Any repeal or
modification of this Section 9.4 shall not affect any rights or obligations then
existing.

         (h) The Sponsor or the Trust may purchase and maintain insurance on
behalf of any Person who is or was an Indemnified Person against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of
his status as such, whether or not the Sponsor would have the power to indemnify
him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 9.4.

         (i) For purposes of this Section 9.4, references to "the Trust" shall
include, in addition to the resulting or surviving entity, any constituent
entity (including any constituent of a constituent) absorbed in a consolidation
or merger, so that any Person who is or was a director, trustee, officer or
employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another
entity, shall stand in the same position under the provisions of this Section
9.4 with respect to the resulting or surviving entity as he would have with
respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.

         (j) The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or
granted pursuant to, this Section 9.4 shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, (i) continue as to a Person who has ceased to be an
Indemnified Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and
administrators of such a Person; and (ii) survive the termination or expiration
of this Declaration or the earlier removal or resignation of an Indemnified
Person.

         Section 9.5. Outside Businesses. Any Covered Person, the Sponsor and
the Institutional Trustee (subject to Section 4.1(c)) may engage in or possess
an interest in other business ventures of any nature or description,
independently or with others, similar or dissimilar to the business of the
Trust, and the Trust and the Holders of Securities shall have no rights by
virtue of this Declaration in and to such independent ventures or the income or
profits derived therefrom, and the pursuit of any such venture, even if
competitive with the business of the Trust, shall not be deemed wrongful or
improper. None of any Covered Person, the Sponsor or the Institutional Trustee
shall be obligated to present any particular investment or other



                                       39
<PAGE>


opportunity to the Trust even if such opportunity is of a character that, if
presented to the Trust, could be taken by the Trust, and any Covered Person, the
Sponsor and the Institutional Trustee shall have the right to take for its own
account (individually or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to others
any such particular investment or other opportunity. Any Covered Person and the
Institutional Trustee may engage or be interested in any financial or other
transaction with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor, or may act as
depositary for, trustee or agent for, or act on any committee or body of holders
of, securities or other obligations of the Sponsor or its Affiliates.

         Section 9.6. Compensation; Fee. The Sponsor agrees:

         (a) to pay to the Institutional Trustee from time to time such
compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder as the parties shall
agree from time to time (which compensation shall not be limited by any
provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express
trust); and

         (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
Institutional Trustee upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made by the Institutional Trustee in accordance with
any provision of this Declaration (including the reasonable compensation and the
reasonable expenses and disbursements of their respective agents and counsel),
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may be attributable to its
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

         The provisions of this Section 9.6 shall survive the dissolution of the
Trust and the termination of this Declaration and the removal or resignation of
the Institutional Trustee.

         No Trustee may claim any lien or charge on any property of the Trust as
a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.6.

                                   ARTICLE X.

                               TAX AND ACCOUNTING

reflect in reasonable detail each transaction of the Trust. The books of account
shall be maintained, at the Sponsor's expense, in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. The books of account and
the records of the Trust shall be examined by and reported upon (either
separately or as part of the Sponsor's regularly prepared consolidated financial
report) as of the end of each Fiscal Year of the Trust by a firm of independent
certified public accountants selected by the Administrators.



                                       40

         (b) The Administrators shall cause to be duly prepared and delivered to
each of the Holders of Securities Form 1099 or such other annual United States
federal income tax information statement required by the Code, if any,
containing such information with regard to the Securities held by each Holder as
is required by the Code and the Treasury Regulations. Notwithstanding any right
under the Code to deliver any such statement at a later date, the Administrators
shall endeavor to deliver all such statements within 30 days after the end of
each Fiscal Year of the Trust.

         (c) The Administrators, at the Sponsor's expense, shall cause to be
duly prepared at the principal office of the Sponsor in the United States, as
United States is defined in Section 7701(a)(9) of the Code (or at the principal
office of the Trust if the Sponsor has no such principal office in the United
States), and filed an annual United States federal income tax return on a Form
1041 or such other form required by United States federal income tax law, if
any, and any other annual income tax returns required to be filed by the
Administrators on behalf of the Trust with any state or local taxing authority.

         Section 10.3. Banking. The Trust shall maintain in the United States,
as defined for purposes of Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-7, one or more
bank accounts in the name and for the sole benefit of the Trust; provided,
however, that all payments of funds in respect of the Debentures held by the
Institutional Trustee shall be made directly to the Property Account and no
other funds of the Trust shall be deposited in the Property Account. The sole
signatories for such accounts (including the Property Account) shall be
designated by the Institutional Trustee.

         Section 10.4. Withholding. The Institutional Trustee or any Paying
Agent and the Administrators shall comply with all withholding requirements
under United States federal, state and local law. The Institutional Trustee or
any Paying Agent shall request, and each Holder shall provide to the
Institutional Trustee or any Paying Agent, such forms or certificates as are
necessary to establish an exemption from withholding with respect to the Holder,
and any representations and forms as shall reasonably be requested by the
Institutional Trustee or any Paying Agent to assist it in determining the extent
of, and in fulfilling, its withholding obligations. The Administrators shall
file required forms with applicable jurisdictions and, unless an exemption from
withholding is properly established by a Holder, shall remit amounts withheld
with respect to the Holder to applicable jurisdictions. To the extent that the
Institutional Trustee or any Paying Agent is required to withhold and pay over
any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any
Holder, the amount withheld shall be deemed to be a Distribution in the amount
of the withholding to the Holder. In the event of any claimed overwithholding,
Holders shall be limited to an action against the applicable jurisdiction. If
the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual Distributions
made, the Institutional Trustee or any Paying Agent may reduce subsequent
Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

         Section 10.5. Intention of the Parties. It is the intention of the
parties hereto that the Trust be classified for United States federal income tax
purposes as a grantor trust. The provisions of this Declaration shall be
interpreted to further this intention of the parties.

         Section 11.1. Amendments.

         (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Declaration or by any
applicable terms of the Securities, this Declaration may only be amended by a
written instrument approved and executed by the Institutional Trustee.

         (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article XI, an
amendment may be made, and any such purported amendment shall be valid and
effective only if:

                  (i) the Institutional Trustee shall have first received

                           (A) an Officers' Certificate from each of the Trust
                  and the Sponsor that such amendment is permitted by, and
                  conforms to, the terms of this Declaration (including the
                  terms of the Securities); and

                           (B) an opinion of counsel (who may be counsel to the
                  Sponsor or the Trust) that such amendment is permitted by, and
                  conforms to, the terms of this Declaration (including the
                  terms of the Securities); and

                  (ii) the result of such amendment would not be to

                           (A) cause the Trust to cease to be classified for
                  purposes of United States federal income taxation as a grantor
                  trust; or

                           (B) cause the Trust to be deemed to be an Investment
                  Company required to be registered under the Investment Company
                  Act.

         (c) Except as provided in Section 11.1(d), (e) or (h), no amendment
shall be made, and any such purported amendment shall be void and ineffective
unless the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities
shall have consented to such amendment.

         (d) In addition to and notwithstanding any other provision in this
Declaration, without the consent of each affected Holder, this Declaration may
not be amended to (i) change the amount or timing of any Distribution on the
Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required
to be made in respect of the Securities as of a specified date or change any
conversion or exchange provisions or (ii) restrict the right of a Holder to
institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such date.

         (e) Sections 9.1(b) and 9.1(c) and this Section 11.1 shall not be
amended without the consent of all of the Holders of the Securities.

of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities.

         (g) The rights of the Holders of the Capital Securities under Article
IV to appoint and remove the Institutional Trustee shall not be amended without
the consent of the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities.

         (h) This Declaration may be amended by the Institutional Trustee and
the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities without
the consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities to:

                  (i) cure any ambiguity;

                  (ii) correct or supplement any provision in this Declaration
         that may be defective or inconsistent with any other provision of this
         Declaration;

                  (iii) add to the covenants, restrictions or obligations of the
         Sponsor; or

                  (iv) modify, eliminate or add to any provision of this
         Declaration to such extent as may be necessary to ensure that the Trust
         will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes at all
         times as a grantor trust and will not be required to register as an
         "investment company" under the Investment Company Act (including
         without limitation to conform to any change in Rule 3a-5, Rule 3a-7 or
         any other applicable rule under the Investment Company Act or written
         change in interpretation or application thereof by any legislative
         body, court, government agency or regulatory authority) which amendment
         does not have a material adverse effect on the rights, preferences or
         privileges of the Holders of Securities;

         provided, however, that no such modification, elimination or addition
referred to in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) shall adversely affect in any
material respect the powers, preferences or special rights of Holders of Capital
Securities.

         Section 11.2. Meetings of the Holders of Securities; Action by Written
Consent.

         (a) Meetings of the Holders of any class of Securities may be called at
any time by the Administrators (or as provided in the terms of the Securities)
to consider and act on any matter on which Holders of such class of Securities
are entitled to act under the terms of this Declaration or the terms of the
Securities. The Administrators shall call a meeting of the Holders of such class
if directed to do so by the Holders of at least 10% in liquidation amount of
such class of Securities. Such direction shall be given by delivering to the
Administrators one or more calls in a writing stating that the signing Holders
of the Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the general or specific
purpose for which the meeting is to be called. Any Holders of the Securities
calling a meeting shall specify in writing the Certificates held by the Holders
of the Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and only those
Securities represented by such Certificates shall be counted for purposes of
determining whether the required percentage set forth in the second sentence of
this paragraph has been met.

         (b) Except to the extent otherwise provided in the terms of the
Securities, the following provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of the
Securities:



                                       43
<PAGE>

                  (i) notice of any such meeting shall be given to all the
         Holders of the Securities having a right to vote thereat at least 7
         days and not more than 60 days before the date of such meeting.
         Whenever a vote, consent or approval of the Holders of the Securities
         is permitted or required under this Declaration, such vote, consent or
         approval may be given at a meeting of the Holders of the Securities.
         Any action that may be taken at a meeting of the Holders of the
         Securities may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing
         setting forth the action so taken is signed by the Holders of the
         Securities owning not less than the minimum amount of Securities in
         liquidation amount that would be necessary to authorize or take such
         action at a meeting at which all Holders of the Securities having a
         right to vote thereon were present and voting. Prompt notice of the
         taking of action without a meeting shall be given to the Holders of the
         Securities entitled to vote who have not consented in writing. The
         Administrators may specify that any written ballot submitted to the
         Holders of the Securities for the purpose of taking any action without
         a meeting shall be returned to the Trust within the time specified by
         the Administrators;

                  (ii) each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act
         for it by proxy on all matters in which a Holder of Securities is
         entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or
         voting or participating at a meeting. No proxy shall be valid after the
         expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided
         in the proxy. Every proxy shall be revocable at the pleasure of the
         Holder of the Securities executing it. Except as otherwise provided
         herein, all matters relating to the giving, voting or validity of
         proxies shall be governed by the General Corporation Law of the State
         of Connecticut relating to proxies, and judicial interpretations
         thereunder, as if the Trust were a Connecticut corporation and the
         Holders of the Securities were stockholders of a Connecticut
         corporation; each meeting of the Holders of the Securities shall be
         conducted by the Administrators or by such other Person that the
         Administrators may designate; and

                  (iii) unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, or the
         terms of the Securities otherwise provides, the Administrators, in
         their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to
         meetings of Holders of Securities, including notice of the time, place
         or purpose of any meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any
         Holders of the Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent
         without a meeting, the establishment of a record date, quorum
         requirements, voting in person or by proxy or any other matter with
         respect to the exercise of any such right to vote; provided, however,
         that each meeting shall be conducted in the United States (as that term
         is defined in Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-7).

                                  ARTICLE XII.

                                     ANNEX I

                               TERMS OF SECURITIES

         Pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Amended and Restated Declaration of
Trust, dated as of May 15, 2003 (as amended from time to time, the
"Declaration"), the designation, rights, privileges, restrictions, preferences
and other terms and provisions of the Capital Securities and the Common
Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined herein
has the meaning set forth in the Declaration):

         1. Designation and Number.

         (a) 17,500 Fixed/Floating Rate Capital Securities of PXRE CAPITAL
Statutory Trust II (the "Trust"), with an aggregate stated liquidation amount
with respect to the assets of the Trust of seventeen million five hundred
thousand U.S. dollars ($17,500,000.00) and a stated liquidation amount with
respect to the assets of the Trust of $1,000.00 per Capital Security, are hereby
designated for the purposes of identification only as the "Capital Securities".
The Capital Security Certificates evidencing the Capital Securities shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration, with such changes
and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary
usage, custom or practice.

         (b) 542 Fixed/Floating Rate Common Securities of the Trust, with an
aggregate stated liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of
five hundred and forty-two thousand U.S. dollars ($542,000.00) and a stated
liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the Trust of $1,000.00 per
Common Security (the "Common Securities") will be evidenced by Common Security
Certificates substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the Declaration, with
such changes and additions thereto or deletions therefrom as may be required by
ordinary usage, custom or practice.

         2. Distributions.

         (a) Distributions will be payable on each Security for the period
beginning on (and including) the date of original issuance and ending on (but
excluding) May 15, 2008 at a rate per annum of 7.35% and shall bear interest for
each successive Distribution Period beginning on (and including) May 15, 2008,
and each succeeding Distribution Payment Date, and ending on (but excluding) the
next succeeding Distribution Payment Date (each, a "Distribution Period") at a
rate per annum equal to the 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described below, plus
4.10% (the "Coupon Rate"), applied to the stated liquidation amount thereof,
such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the
Institutional Trustee. Distributions in arrears for more than one quarterly
period will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the applicable
Distribution Rate (to the extent permitted by law). Distributions, as used
herein, include cash distributions, any such compounded distributions and any
Additional Sums payable on the Debentures unless otherwise noted. A Distribution
is payable only to the extent that payments are made in respect of the
Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional
Trustee has funds available therefor. In the event that any date on which a
Distribution is payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment of
the Distribution payable on such date shall be made on the next succeeding day
which is a Business




                                      I-1
<PAGE>


Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any such delay),
except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding calendar year, such
payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case
with the same force and effect as if made on the date such payment was
originally payable. The amount of the Distribution payable (i) for any
Distribution Period commencing on or after the date of original issuance but
before May 15, 2008 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months, and (ii) for the Distribution Period commencing on or after May
15, 2008 and each succeeding Distribution Period will be calculated by applying
the Distribution Rate to the stated liquidation amount outstanding at the
commencement of the Distribution Period and multiplying each such amount by the
actual number of days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360. All
percentages resulting from any calculations on the Securities will be rounded,
if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage point, with
five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or
.09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655), and all dollar amounts used
in or resulting from such calculation will be rounded to the nearest cent (with
one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         "3-Month LIBOR" means the London interbank offered interest rate for
three-month, U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Debenture Trustee in the
following order of priority:

                  (1) the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for U.S.
         dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that appears on Telerate
         Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related Determination
         Date (as defined below). "Telerate Page 3750" means the display
         designated as "Page 3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate Service or such
         other page as may replace Page 3750 on that service or such other
         service or services as may be nominated by the British Bankers'
         Association as the information vendor for the purpose of displaying
         London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits;

                  (2) if such rate cannot be identified on the related
         Determination Date, the Debenture Trustee will request the principal
         London offices of four leading banks in the London interbank market to
         provide such banks' offered quotations (expressed as percentages per
         annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for U.S. dollar
         deposits having a three-month maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time)
         on such Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided,
         3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations;

                  (3) if fewer than two such quotations are provided as
         requested in clause (2) above, the Debenture Trustee will request four
         major New York City banks to provide such banks' offered quotations
         (expressed as percentages per annum) to leading European banks for
         loans in U.S. dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such
         Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are provided,
         3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations; and

                  (4) if fewer than two such quotations are provided as
         requested in clause (3) above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month LIBOR
         determined with respect to the Distribution Period immediately
         preceding such current Distribution Period.


                                      I-2
<PAGE>

         If the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that
initially appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
related Determination Date is superseded on the Telerate Page 3750 by a
corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such Determination Date, then the
corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable page will be the applicable
3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days
(i.e., a business day in which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the particular Distribution
Period for which a Coupon Rate is being determined.

         "Interest Rate" means for the period beginning on (and including) the
date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) May 15, 2008 the rate
per annum of 7.35% and for each Distribution Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         "Maturity Date" means May 15, 2033.

         (b) Distributions on the Securities will be cumulative, will accrue
from the date of original issuance, and will be payable, subject to extension of
distribution payment periods as described herein, quarterly in arrears on August
15, November 15, February 15 and May 15 of each year, commencing on August 15,
2003 (each a "Distribution Payment Date") when, as and if available for payment.
The Debenture Issuer has the right under the Indenture to defer payments of
interest on the Debentures, so long as no Indenture Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, by deferring the payment of interest on the
Debentures for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods (each an "Extension
Period") at any time and from time to time, subject to the conditions described
below, during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable.
During any Extension Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures,
and interest on such accrued interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the
Distribution Rate in effect for each such Extension Period, compounded quarterly
(from the date such interest would have been payable were it not for the
Extension Period), to the extent permitted by law (such interest referred to
herein as "Additional Interest"). No Extension Period may end on a date other
than a Distribution Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period the
Debenture Issuer shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid on the
Debentures (together with Additional Interest thereon); provided, however, that
no Extension Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date and provided further,
however, that during any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer shall not,
and shall not permit any Affiliate of the Debenture Issuer controlled by the
Debenture Issuer to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or
redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of
the Debenture Issuer's or such Affiliates' share capital or capital stock (other
than payments of dividends or distributions to the Debenture Issuer or a
Subsidiary of the Debenture Issuer) or make any guarantee payments with respect
to the foregoing, or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or
premium, if any, on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the
Debenture Issuer or any Affiliate of the Debenture Issuer controlled by the
Debenture Issuer that rank pari passu in all respects with or junior in interest
to the Debentures (other than, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, (a)
repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares




                                      I-3
<PAGE>


or capital stock of the Debenture Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Debenture
Issuer in connection with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar
arrangement with or for the benefit of one or more employees, officers,
directors or consultants, in connection with a dividend reinvestment or
shareholder share purchase plan or in connection with the issuance of share
capital or capital stock of the Debenture Issuer or any Subsidiary of the
Debenture Issuer (or securities convertible into or exercisable for such share
capital or capital stock) as consideration in an acquisition transaction entered
into prior to the applicable Extension Period, (b) as a result of any exchange
or conversion of any class or series of the Debenture Issuer's share capital (or
any capital stock of a Subsidiary of the Debenture Issuer) for any class or
series of the Debenture Issuer's share capital (or, in case of a Subsidiary of
the Debenture Issuer, any class or series of such Subsidiary's capital stock) or
of any class or series of the Debenture Issuer's indebtedness for any class or
series of the Debenture Issuer's share capital (or, in case of indebtedness of a
Subsidiary of the Debenture Issuer, of any class or series of such Subsidiary's
indebtedness for any class or series of such Subsidiary's capital stock), (c)
the purchase of fractional interests in the Debenture Issuer's share capital (or
the capital stock of a Subsidiary of the Debenture Issuer) pursuant to the
conversion or exchange provisions of such share capital or capital stock or the
security being converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in
connection with any shareholders' rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock
or other property under any shareholders' rights plan, or the redemption or
repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, (e) any dividend in the form of shares,
stock, warrants, options or other rights where the bonus shares, dividend stock,
shares or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or other
rights are the same shares or stock as that on which the dividend is being paid
or ranks pari passu with or junior to such shares or stock and any cash payments
in lieu of fractional shares issued in connection therewith, or (f) payments
under the Guarantee). Prior to the termination of any Extension Period, the
Debenture Issuer may further extend such period, provided that such period
together with all such previous and further consecutive extensions thereof shall
not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the Maturity Date.
Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer may commence a
new Extension Period, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest or
Additional Interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except
at the end thereof, but each installment of interest that would otherwise have
been due and payable during such Extension Period shall bear Additional
Interest. During any Extension Period, Distributions on the Securities shall be
deferred for a period equal to the Extension Period. If Distributions are
deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on the date that the related
Extension Period terminates, to Holders of the Securities as they appear on the
books and records of the Trust on the record date immediately preceding such
date. Distributions on the Securities must be paid on the dates payable (after
giving effect to any Extension Period) to the extent that the Trust has funds
available for the payment of such distributions in the Property Account of the
Trust. The Trust's funds available for Distribution to the Holders of the
Securities will be limited to payments received from the Debenture Issuer. The
payment of Distributions out of moneys held by the Trust is guaranteed by the
Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

         (c) Distributions on the Securities will be payable to the Holders
thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the relevant
record dates. The relevant record dates shall be 15 days before the relevant
Distribution Payment Date. Distributions payable on any Securities that are not
punctually paid on any Distribution Payment Date, as a result of the Debenture
Issuer having failed to make a payment under the Debentures, as the case may be,
when due (taking into account any Extension Period), will cease to be payable to
the Person in whose name such Securities are registered on the relevant record
date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to the Person in
whose name such Securities are registered on the special record date or other
specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture. If any date on which
Distributions are payable on the Securities is not a Business Day, then payment
of the Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day
that is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of
any such delay) except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on such payment
date.



                                      I-4
<PAGE>

         (d) In the event that there is any money or other property held by or
for the Trust that is not accounted for hereunder, such property shall be
distributed Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of the Securities.

         3. Liquidation Distribution Upon Dissolution. In the event of the
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or termination of
the Trust (each a "Liquidation") other than in connection with a redemption of
the Debentures, the Holders of the Securities will be entitled to receive out of
the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of the Securities,
after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (to the extent not
satisfied by the Debenture Issuer), distributions equal to the lesser of (i) the
aggregate of the stated liquidation amount of $1,000.00 per Security plus
accrued and unpaid Distributions thereon to the date of payment, to the extent
the Trust shall have funds available therefor, and (ii) the amount of assets of
the Trust remaining available for contributions to Holders in liquidation of the
Trust (such amount being the "Liquidation Distribution"), unless in connection
with such Liquidation, the Debentures in an aggregate stated principal amount
equal to the aggregate stated liquidation amount of such Securities, with an
interest rate equal to the Distribution Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid
interest in an amount equal to the accrued and unpaid Distributions on, and
having the same record date as, such Securities, after paying or making
reasonable provision to pay all claims and obligations of the Trust in
accordance with the Statutory Trust Act, shall be distributed on a Pro Rata
basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.

         The Sponsor, as the Holder of all of the Common Securities, has the
right at any time to dissolve the Trust (including, without limitation, upon the
occurrence of a Special Event) and, after satisfaction of liabilities to
creditors of the Trust, cause the Debentures to be distributed to the Holders of
the Securities on a Pro Rata basis in accordance with the aggregate stated
liquidation amount thereof.

         If a Liquidation of the Trust occurs as described in clause (i), (ii),
(iii) or (v) in Section 7.1(a) of the Declaration, the Trust shall be liquidated
by the Institutional Trustee as expeditiously as it determines to be possible by
distributing, after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust, to
the Holders of the Securities, the Debentures on a Pro Rata basis to the extent
not satisfied by the Debenture Issuer, unless such distribution is determined by
the Institutional Trustee not to be practical, in which event such Holders will
be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for distribution
to the Holders, after satisfaction of liabilities of creditors of the Trust to
the extent not satisfied by the Debenture Issuer, an amount equal to the
Liquidation Distribution. An early Liquidation of the Trust pursuant to clause
(iv) of Section 7.1(a) of the Declaration shall occur if the Institutional
Trustee determines that such Liquidation is possible by distributing, after
satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the Trust, to the Holders of the
Securities on a Pro Rata basis, the Debentures, and such distribution occurs.



                                      I-5
<PAGE>

         If, upon any such Liquidation the Liquidation Distribution can be paid
only in part because the Trust has insufficient assets available to pay in full
the aggregate Liquidation Distribution, then the amounts payable directly by the
Trust on such Capital Securities shall be paid to the Holders of the Securities
on a Pro Rata basis, except that if an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, the Capital Securities shall have a preference over the Common
Securities with regard to such distributions.

         After the date for any distribution of the Debentures upon dissolution
of the Trust (i) the Securities of the Trust will be deemed to be no longer
outstanding, (ii) upon surrender of a Holder's Securities certificate, such
Holder of the Securities will receive a certificate representing the Debentures
to be delivered upon such distribution (iii) any certificates representing the
Securities still outstanding will be deemed to represent undivided beneficial
interests in such of the Debentures as have an aggregate principal amount equal
to the aggregate stated liquidation amount with an interest rate identical to
the Distribution Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid interest equal to
accrued and unpaid distributions on, the Securities until such certificates are
presented to the Debenture Issuer or its agent for transfer or reissuance (and
until such certificates are so surrendered, no payments of interest or principal
shall be made to Holders of Securities in respect of any payments due and
payable under the Debentures; provided, however that such failure to pay shall
not be deemed to be an Event of Default and shall not entitle the Holder to the
benefits of the Guarantee), and (iv) all rights of Holders of Securities under
the Declaration shall cease, except the right of such Holders to receive
Debentures upon surrender of certificates representing such Securities.

         4. Redemption and Distribution.

         (a) The Debentures will mature on May 15, 2033. The Debentures may be
redeemed by the Debenture Issuer, in whole or in part at any Distribution
Payment Date on or after May 15, 2008, at the Optional Redemption Price. In
addition, the Debentures may be redeemed by the Debenture Issuer at the Special
Redemption Price, in whole but not in part, at any Distribution Payment Date,
upon the occurrence and continuation of a Special Event within 120 days
following the occurrence of such Special Event at the Special Redemption Price,
upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to holders of such
Debentures so long as such Special Event is continuing. The Sponsor shall
appoint a Quotation Agent, which initially shall be U. S. Bank National
Association, for the purpose of performing the services contemplated in or by
reference in, the definition of Special Redemption Price. Any error in the
calculation of the Special Redemption Price by the Quotation Agent or the
Debenture Trustee may be corrected at any time by notice delivered to the
Sponsor and the holders of the Capital Securities. Subject to the corrective
rights set forth above, all certificates, communications, opinions,
determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or
obtained for the purposes of the provisions relating to the payment and
calculation of the Special Redemption Price on the Debentures or the Capital
Securities by the Debenture Trustee, the Quotation Agent or the Institutional
Trustee, as the case may be, shall (in the absence of willful default, bad faith
or manifest error) be final, conclusive and binding on the holders of the
Debentures and the Capital Securities, the Trust and the Sponsor, and no
liability shall attach (except as provided above) to the Debenture Trustee, the
Quotation Agent or the Institutional Trustee in connection with the exercise or
non-exercise by any of them of their respective powers, duties and discretion.

         "Comparable Treasury Issue" means with respect to any Special
Redemption Date the United States Treasury security selected by the Quotation
Agent as having a maturity comparable to the Fixed Rate Period Remaining Life
that would be utilized, at the time of selection and in accordance with
customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities
of comparable maturity to the Fixed Rate Period Remaining Life. If no United
States Treasury security has a maturity which is within a period from three
months before to three months after May 15, 2008, the two most closely
corresponding fixed, non-callable United States Treasury securities, as selected
by the Quotation Agent, shall be used as the Comparable Treasury Issue, and the
Treasury Rate shall be interpolated and extrapolated on a straight-line basis,
rounding to the nearest month using such securities.

         "Comparable Treasury Price" means (a) the average of five Reference
Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Special Redemption Date, after excluding the
highest and lowest such Reference Treasury Dealer Quotations, or (b) if the
Quotation Agent obtains fewer than five such Reference Treasury Dealer
Quotations, the average of all such Quotations.

         "Federal Reserve" means the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System and any successor federal agency.

         "Fixed Rate Period Remaining Life" means, with respect to any

that, as a result of the occurrence of a change in law or regulation or written
change (including any announced prospective change) in interpretation or
application of law or regulation by any legislative body, court, governmental
agency or regulatory authority, there is more than an insubstantial risk that
the Trust is or, within 90 days of the date of such opinion, will be considered
an Investment Company that is required to be registered under the Investment
Company Act which change or prospective change becomes effective or would become
effective, as the case may be, on or after the date of the issuance of the
Debentures.

         "Maturity Date" means May 15, 2033.

         "Optional Redemption Date" shall mean the date fixed for the redemption
of Capital Securities, which shall be August 15, November 15, February 15 or May
15 on or after May 15, 2008.

          "Optional Redemption Price" means 100% of the principal amount of the
Debentures being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Debentures

determined by the Quotation Agent, of the bid and asked prices for the
Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed in each case as a percentage of its
principal amount) quoted in writing to the Debenture Trustee by such Reference
Treasury Dealer at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the third Business Day
preceding such Redemption Date.

         "Special Event" means a Tax Event or an Investment Company Event.

months) at the Treasury Rate, plus (B) accrued and unpaid interest (including
Additional Interest) on the Debentures to such Special Redemption Date, or (b)
if the Special Redemption Date occurs on or after May 15, 2008, 100% of the

any official administrative pronouncement (including any private letter ruling,
technical advice memorandum, field service advice, regulatory procedure, notice
or announcement including any notice or announcement of intent to adopt such
procedures or regulations (an "Administrative Action")) or judicial decision
interpreting or applying such laws or regulations, regardless of whether such
Administrative Action or judicial decision is issued to or in connection with a
proceeding involving the Debenture Issuer or the Trust and whether or not
subject to review or

<PAGE>



appeal, which amendment, clarification, change, Administrative Action or
decision is enacted, promulgated or announced, in each case on or after the date
of original issuance of the Debentures, there is more than an insubstantial risk
that: (i) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of the date of such opinion,
subject to United States federal income tax with respect to income received or
accrued on the Debentures; (ii) interest payable by the Debenture Issuer on the
Debentures is not, or within 90 days of the date of such opinion, will not be,
deductible by the Debenture Issuer, in whole or in part, for United States
federal income tax purposes; or (iii) the Trust is, or will be within 90 days of
the date of such opinion, subject to more than a de minimis amount of other

the average for the week immediately prior to the date of calculation, appearing
in the most recently published statistical release designated H.15 (519) or any
successor publication which is published weekly by the Federal Reserve and which
establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted
to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury Constant Maturities," for the
maturity corresponding to the Fixed Rate Period Remaining Life (if no maturity
is within three months before or after the Fixed Rate Period Remaining Life,
yields for the two published maturities most closely corresponding to the Fixed
Rate Period Remaining Life shall be determined and the Treasury Rate shall be
interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding
to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor release) is not
published during the week preceding the calculation date or does not contain
such yields, the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to
maturity of the Comparable Treasury Issue, calculated using a price for the
Comparable Treasury Issue (expressed as a percentage of its principal amount)
equal to the Comparable Treasury Price for such Special Redemption Date. The
Treasury Rate shall be calculated by the Quotation Agent on the third Business
Day preceding the Special Redemption Date.

         (b) Upon the repayment in full at maturity or redemption in whole or in
part of the Debentures (other than following the distribution of the Debentures
to the Holders of the Securities), the proceeds from such repayment or payment
shall concurrently be applied to redeem Pro Rata at the applicable Optional
Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price, as applicable, Securities having
an aggregate liquidation amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures so repaid or redeemed; provided, however, that holders of such
Securities shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice of such
redemption (other than at the scheduled maturity of the Debentures).

         (c) If fewer than all the outstanding Securities are to be so redeemed,
the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro Rata and
the Capital Securities to be redeemed will be redeemed Pro Rata from each Holder
of Capital Securities.

         (d) The Trust may not redeem fewer than all the outstanding Capital
Securities unless all accrued and unpaid Distributions have been paid on all
Capital Securities for all quarterly Distribution periods terminating on or
before the date of redemption.

         (e) Redemption or Distribution Procedures.

                  (i) Notice of any redemption of, or notice of distribution of
         the Debentures in exchange for, the Securities (a
         "Redemption/Distribution Notice") will be given by the Trust by mail to
         each Holder of Securities to be redeemed or exchanged not fewer than 30
         nor more than 60 days before the date fixed for redemption or exchange
         thereof which, in the case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for
         redemption of the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the
         date of redemption or exchange and the dates on which notices are given
         pursuant to this paragraph 4(e)(i), a Redemption/Distribution Notice
         shall be deemed to be given on the day such notice is first mailed by
         first-class mail, postage prepaid, to Holders of such Securities. Each
         Redemption/Distribution Notice shall be addressed to the Holders of
         such Securities at the address of each such Holder appearing on the
         books and records of the Trust. No defect in the
         Redemption/Distribution Notice or in the mailing thereof with respect
         to any Holder shall affect the validity of the redemption or exchange
         proceedings with respect to any other Holder.

                  (ii) If the Securities are to be redeemed and the Trust gives
         a Redemption/ Distribution Notice, which notice may only be issued if
         the Debentures are redeemed as set out in this paragraph 4 (which
         notice will be irrevocable), then, provided that the Institutional
         Trustee has a sufficient amount of cash in connection with the related
         redemption or maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee
         will pay the relevant Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption
         Price, as applicable, to the Holders of such Securities by check mailed
         to the address of each such Holder appearing on the books and records
         of the Trust on the Optional Redemption Date. If a
         Redemption/Distribution Notice shall have been given and funds
         deposited as required then immediately prior to the close of business
         on the date of such deposit Distributions will cease to accrue on the
         Securities so called for redemption and all rights of Holders of such
         Securities so called for redemption will cease, except the right of the
         Holders of such Securities to receive the applicable Optional
         Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price specified in paragraph
         4(a), but without interest on such Optional Redemption Price or Special
         Redemption Price. If any date fixed for redemption of Securities is not
         a Business Day, then payment of any such Optional Redemption Price or
         Special Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on the next
         succeeding day that is a Business Day (and without any interest or
         other payment in respect of any such delay) except that, if such
         Business Day falls in the next calendar year, such payment will be made
         on the immediately preceding Business Day, in each case with the same
         force and effect as if made on such date fixed for redemption. If
         payment of the Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price in
         respect of any Securities is improperly withheld or refused and not
         paid either by the Trust or by the Debenture Issuer as guarantor
         pursuant to the Guarantee, Distributions on such Securities will
         continue to accrue at the Distribution Rate from the original Optional
         Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date to the actual date of
         payment, in which case the actual payment date will be considered the
         date fixed for redemption for purposes of calculating the Optional
         Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price. In the event of any
         redemption of the Capital Securities issued by the Trust in part, the
         Trust shall not be required to (i) issue, register the transfer of or
         exchange any Security during a period beginning at the opening of
         business 15 days before any selection for redemption of the Capital
         Securities and ending at the close of business on the earliest date on
         which the relevant notice of redemption is deemed to have been given to
         all Holders of the Capital Securities to be so redeemed or (ii)
         register the transfer of or exchange any Capital Securities so selected
         for redemption, in whole or in part, except for the unredeemed portion
         of any Capital Securities being redeemed in part.

<PAGE>

                  (iii) Redemption/Distribution Notices shall be sent by the
         Administrators on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect of the Capital
         Securities, the Holders thereof and (B) in respect of the Common
         Securities, the Holder thereof.

                  (iv) Subject to the foregoing and applicable law (including,
         without limitation, United States federal securities laws), and
         provided that the acquiror is not the Holder of the Common Securities
         or the obligor under the Indenture, the Sponsor or any of its
         subsidiaries may at any time and from time to time purchase outstanding
         Capital Securities by tender, in the open market or by private
         agreement.

         5. Voting Rights - Capital Securities.

         (a) Except as provided under paragraphs 5(b) and 7 and as otherwise
required by law and the Declaration, the Holders of the Capital Securities will
have no voting rights. The Administrators are required to call a meeting of the
Holders of the Capital Securities if directed to do so by Holders of at least
10% in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities.

         (b) Subject to the requirements of obtaining a tax opinion by the
Institutional Trustee in certain circumstances set forth in the last sentence of
this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities, voting separately as a class, have the right to direct the time,
method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Institutional Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the
Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including the right to direct the
Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, to (i) exercise the remedies
available under the Indenture as the holder of the Debentures, (ii) waive any
past default that is waivable under the Indenture, (iii) exercise any right to
rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be
due and payable or (iv) consent on behalf of all the Holders of the Capital
Securities to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the
Debentures where such consent shall be required; provided, however, that, where
a consent or action under the Indenture would require the consent or act of the
holders of greater than a simple majority in aggregate principal amount of
Debentures (a "Super Majority") affected thereby, the Institutional Trustee may
only give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the
Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities outstanding which the relevant Super Majority represents of the
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding. If the Institutional
Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures after the Holders of a
Majority in liquidation amount of such Capital Securities have so directed the
Institutional Trustee, to the fullest extent permitted by law, a Holder of the
Capital Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against the
Debenture Issuer to enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the
Debentures without first instituting any legal proceeding against the
Institutional Trustee or any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if an Event of Default has



                                      I-11
<PAGE>


occurred and is continuing and such event is attributable to the failure of the
Debenture Issuer to pay interest or principal on the Debentures on the date the
interest or principal is payable (or in the case of redemption, the Optional
Redemption Date or the Special Redemption Date, as applicable), then a Holder of
record of the Capital Securities may directly institute a proceeding for
enforcement of payment on or after the respective due dates specified in the
Debentures, to such Holder directly of the principal of or interest on the
Debentures having an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate
liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder. The Institutional
Trustee shall notify all Holders of the Capital Securities of any default
actually known to the Institutional Trustee with respect to the Debentures
unless (x) such default has been cured prior to the giving of such notice or (y)
the Institutional Trustee determines in good faith that the withholding of such
notice is in the interest of the Holders of such Capital Securities, except
where the default relates to the payment of principal of or interest on any of
the Debentures. Such notice shall state that such Indenture Event of Default
also constitutes an Event of Default hereunder. Except with respect to directing
the time, method and place of conducting a proceeding for a remedy, the
Institutional Trustee shall not take any of the actions described in clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii) above unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an
opinion of tax counsel to the effect that, as a result of such action, the Trust
will not be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal
income tax purposes.

         In the event the consent of the Institutional Trustee, as the holder of
the Debentures, is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment,
modification or termination of the Indenture, the Institutional Trustee shall
request the direction of the Holders of the Securities with respect to such
amendment modification or termination and shall vote with respect to such
amendment, modification or termination as directed by a Majority in liquidation
amount of the Securities voting together as a single class; provided, however,
that where a consent under the Indenture would require the consent of a
Super-Majority, the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent at the
direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the
Securities outstanding which the relevant Super-Majority represents of the
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures outstanding. The Institutional
Trustee shall not take any such action in accordance with the directions of the
Holders of the Securities unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an
opinion of tax counsel to the effect that, as a result of such action, the Trust
will not be classified as other than a grantor trust for United States federal
income tax purposes.

         A waiver of an Indenture Event of Default will constitute a waiver of
the corresponding Event of Default hereunder. Any required approval or direction
of Holders of the Capital Securities may be given at a separate meeting of
Holders of the Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all
of the Holders of the Securities in the Trust or pursuant to written consent.
The Institutional Trustee will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of
the Capital Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action
by written consent of such Holders is to be taken, to be mailed to each Holder
of record of the Capital Securities. Each such notice will include a statement
setting forth the following information (i) the date of such meeting or the date
by which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution
proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote
or of such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions
for the delivery of proxies or consents. No vote or consent of the Holders of
the Capital Securities will be required for the Trust to redeem and cancel
Capital Securities or to distribute the Debentures in accordance with the
Declaration and the terms of the Securities.



                                      I-12
<PAGE>

         Notwithstanding that Holders of the Capital Securities are entitled to
vote or consent under any of the circumstances described above, any of the
Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor
shall not entitle the Holder thereof to vote or consent and shall, for purposes
of such vote or consent, be treated as if such Capital Securities were not
outstanding.

         In no event will Holders of the Capital Securities have the right to
vote to appoint, remove or replace the Administrators, which voting rights are
vested exclusively in the Sponsor as the Holder of all of the Common Securities
of the Trust. Under certain circumstances as more fully described in the
Declaration, Holders of Capital Securities have the right to vote to appoint,
remove or replace the Institutional Trustee.

         6. Voting Rights - Common Securities.

         (a) Except as provided under paragraphs 6(b), 6(c) and 7 and as
otherwise required by law and the Declaration, the Common Securities will have
no voting rights.

         (b) The Holders of the Common Securities are entitled, in accordance
with Article IV of the Declaration, to vote to appoint, remove or replace any
Administrators.

         (c) Subject to Section 6.7 of the Declaration and only after each Event
of Default (if any) with respect to the Capital Securities has been cured,
waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to
last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount
of the Common Securities, voting separately as a class, may direct the time,
method, and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Institutional Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the
Institutional Trustee under the Declaration, including (i) directing the time,
method, place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Debenture Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Debenture
Trustee with respect to the Debentures, (ii) waiving any past default and its
consequences that is waivable under the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right
to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall
be due and payable; provided, however, that, where a consent or action under the
Indenture would require a Super Majority, the Institutional Trustee may only
give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of
at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the
relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures outstanding. Notwithstanding this paragraph 6(c), the Institutional
Trustee shall not revoke any action previously authorized or approved by a vote
or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities. Other than with respect to
directing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Institutional Trustee or the Debenture Trustee as set forth
above, the Institutional Trustee shall not take any action described in (i),
(ii) or (iii) above, unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of
tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States federal income
tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust on account of
such action. If the Institutional Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the
Declaration to the fullest extent permitted by law, any Holder of the Common
Securities may institute a legal proceeding directly against any Person to
enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration, without first
instituting a legal proceeding against the Institutional Trustee or any other
Person.



                                      I-13
<PAGE>

         Any approval or direction of Holders of the Common Securities may be
given at a separate meeting of Holders of the Common Securities convened for
such purpose, at a meeting of all of the Holders of the Securities in the Trust
or pursuant to written consent. The Administrators will cause a notice of any
meeting at which Holders of the Common Securities are entitled to vote, or of
any matter upon which action by written consent of such Holders is to be taken,
to be mailed to each Holder of the Common Securities. Each such notice will
include a statement setting forth (i) the date of such meeting or the date by
which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution proposed
for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote or of
such matter upon which written consent is sought and (iii) instructions for the
delivery of proxies or consents.

         No vote or consent of the Holders of the Common Securities will be
required for the Trust to redeem and cancel Common Securities or to distribute
the Debentures in accordance with the Declaration and the terms of the
Securities.

         7. Amendments to Declaration and Indenture.

         (a) In addition to any requirements under Section 11.1 of the
Declaration, if any proposed amendment to the Declaration provides for, or the
Institutional Trustee, Sponsor or Administrators otherwise propose to effect,
(i) any action that would adversely affect the powers, preferences or special
rights of the Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Declaration or
otherwise, or (ii) the Liquidation of the Trust, other than as described in
Section 7.1 of the Declaration, then the Holders of outstanding Securities,
voting together as a single class, will be entitled to vote on such amendment or
proposal and such amendment or proposal shall not be effective except with the
approval of the Holders of at least a Majority in liquidation amount of the
Securities, affected thereby; provided, however, if any amendment or proposal
referred to in clause (i) above would adversely affect only the Capital
Securities or only the Common Securities, then only the affected class will be
entitled to vote on such amendment or proposal and such amendment or proposal
shall not be effective except with the approval of a Majority in liquidation
amount of such class of Securities.

         (b) In the event the consent of the Institutional Trustee as the holder
of the Debentures is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment,
modification or termination of the Indenture or the Debentures, the
Institutional Trustee shall request the written direction of the Holders of the
Securities with respect to such amendment, modification or termination and shall
vote with respect to such amendment, modification, or termination as directed by
a Majority in liquidation amount of the Securities voting together as a single
class; provided, however, that where a consent under the Indenture would require
a Super Majority, the Institutional Trustee may only give such consent at the
direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the
Securities which the relevant Super Majority represents of the aggregate
principal amount of the Debentures outstanding.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, no amendment or modification may be
made to the Declaration if such amendment or modification would (i) cause the
Trust to be classified for purposes of United States federal income taxation as
other than a grantor trust, (ii) reduce or otherwise adversely affect the powers
of the Institutional Trustee or (iii) cause the Trust to be deemed an Investment
Company which is required to be registered under the Investment Company Act.



                                      I-14

         (d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Declaration, the right of any
Holder of the Capital Securities to receive payment of distributions and other
payments upon redemption or otherwise, on or after their respective due dates,
or to institute a suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates, shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such
Holder. For the protection and enforcement of the foregoing provision, each and
every Holder of the Capital Securities shall be entitled to such relief as can
be given either at law or equity.

         8. Pro Rata. A reference in these terms of the Securities to any
payment, distribution or treatment as being "Pro Rata" shall mean pro rata to
each Holder of the Securities according to the aggregate liquidation amount of
the Securities held by the relevant Holder in relation to the aggregate
liquidation amount of all Securities then outstanding unless, in relation to a
payment, an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case any
funds available to make such payment shall be paid first to each Holder of the
Capital Securities Pro Rata according to the aggregate liquidation amount of the
Capital Securities held by the relevant Holder relative to the aggregate
liquidation amount of all Capital Securities outstanding, and only after
satisfaction of all amounts owed to the Holders of the Capital Securities, to
each Holder of the Common Securities Pro Rata according to the aggregate
liquidation amount of the Common Securities held by the relevant Holder relative
to the aggregate liquidation amount of all Common Securities outstanding.

         9. Ranking. The Capital Securities rank pari passu with and payment
thereon shall be made Pro Rata with the Common Securities except that, where an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the rights of Holders of the
Common Securities to receive payment of Distributions and payments upon
liquidation, redemption and otherwise are subordinated to the rights of the
Holders of the Capital Securities with the result that no payment of any
Distribution on, or Optional Redemption Price (or Special Redemption Price) of,
any Common Security, and no other payment on account of redemption, liquidation
or other acquisition of Common Securities, shall be made unless payment in full
in cash of all accumulated and unpaid Distributions on all outstanding Capital
Securities for all distribution periods terminating on or prior thereto, or in
the case of payment of the Optional Redemption Price (or Special Redemption
Price) the full amount of such Optional Redemption Price (or Special Redemption
Price) on all outstanding Capital Securities then called for redemption, shall
have been made or provided for, and all funds immediately available to the
Institutional Trustee shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of
all Distributions on, or the Optional Redemption Price (or Special Redemption
Price) of, the Capital Securities then due and payable.

         10. Acceptance of Guarantee and Indenture. Each Holder of the Capital
Securities and the Common Securities, by the acceptance of such Securities,
agrees to the provisions of the Guarantee, including the subordination
provisions therein and to the provisions of the Indenture.

         11. No Preemptive Rights. The Holders of the Securities shall have no
preemptive or similar rights to subscribe for any additional securities.

                      [FORM OF REVERSE OF CAPITAL SECURITY]

         Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be payable at an
annual rate equal to 7.35% beginning on (and including) the date of original
issuance and ending on (but excluding) May 15, 2008 and at an annual rate for
each successive Distribution Period beginning on (and including) August 15,
2008, and each succeeding Distribution Payment Date, and ending on (but
excluding) the next succeeding Distribution Payment Date, equal to 3-Month
LIBOR, determined as described below, plus 4.10% (the "Coupon Rate"), applied to
the stated liquidation amount of $1,000.00 per Capital Security, such rate being
the rate of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the Institutional
Trustee. Distributions in arrears will bear interest thereon compounded
quarterly at the Distribution Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law).
The term "Distributions" as used herein includes cash distributions and any such
compounded distributions and any Additional Sums payable on the Debentures
unless otherwise noted. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that
payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee
and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. As
used herein, "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days
(i.e., a business day in which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the commencement of the
relevant Distribution Period. In the event that any date on which a Distribution
is payable on this Capital Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the
Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which
is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any
such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the
payment was originally payable. The amount of the Distribution payable (i) for
any Distribution Period commencing on or after the date of original issuance but
before May 15, 2008 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months, and (ii) for the Distribution Period commencing on or after May
15, 2008 and each succeeding Distribution Period will be computed on the
Distribution Rate to the stated liquidation amount outstanding at the
commencement of the Distribution Period and multiplying each such amount by the
actual number of days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360.

         "3-Month LIBOR" as used herein, means the London interbank offered
interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Debenture
Trustee in the following order of priority: (i) the rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum) for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity
that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page
3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate Service or such other page as may replace Page
3750 on that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by
the British Bankers' Association as the information vendor for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits); (ii) if
such rate cannot be identified on the related Determination Date, the Debenture
Trustee will request the principal London offices of four leading banks in the
London interbank market to provide such banks' offered quotations (expressed as
percentages per annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on
such Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations; (iii) if fewer than two such
quotations are provided as requested in clause (ii) above, the Debenture Trustee
will request four major New York City banks to provide such banks' offered
quotations (expressed as percentages per annum) to leading European banks for
loans in U.S. dollars as of 11:00 a.m.




                                     A-1-5
<PAGE>


(London time) on such Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are
provided, 3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations; and (iv)
if fewer than two such quotations are provided as requested in clause (iii)
above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month LIBOR determined with respect to the
Distribution Period immediately preceding such current Distribution Period. If
the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that initially
appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination Date is superseded on the Telerate Page 3750 by a corrected rate
by 12:00 noon (London time) on such Determination Date, then the corrected rate
as so substituted on the applicable page will be the applicable 3-Month LIBOR
for such Determination Date.

         "Interest Rate" means for the period beginning on (and including) the
date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) May 15, 2008 the rate
per annum of 7.35% and for each Distribution Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All percentages resulting from any calculations on the Capital
Securities will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655),
and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital
Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance
and will be payable quarterly in arrears on August 15, November 15, February 15
and May 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2003. The Debenture Issuer has
the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures,
so long as no Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, by
extending the interest payment period for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods
(each an "Extension Period") at any time and from time to time on the
Debentures, subject to the conditions described below, during which Extension
Period no interest shall be due and payable. During any Extension Period,
interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such accrued
interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Distribution Rate in effect
for each such Extension Period, compounded quarterly from the date such interest
would have been payable were it not for the Extension Period, to the extent
permitted by law (such interest referred to herein as "Additional Interest"). No
Extension Period may end on a date other than a Distribution Payment Date. At
the end of any such Extension Period the Debenture Issuer shall pay all interest
then accrued and unpaid on the Debentures (together with Additional Interest
thereon); provided, however, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the
Maturity Date. Prior to the termination of any Extension Period, the Debenture
Issuer may further extend such period, provided that such period together with
all such previous and further consecutive extensions thereof shall not exceed 20
consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the Maturity Date. Upon the
termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer may commence a new
Extension Period, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest or
Additional Interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except
at the end thereof, but each installment of interest that would otherwise have
been due and payable during such Extension Period shall bear Additional
Interest. During any Extension Period, Distributions on the Capital Securities
shall be deferred for a period equal to the Extension Period. If Distributions
are deferred, the





                                     A-1-6
<PAGE>


Distributions due shall be paid on the date that the related Extension Period
terminates, to Holders of the Capital Securities as they appear on the books and
records of the Trust on the record date immediately preceding such date.
Distributions on the Capital Securities must be paid on the dates payable (after
giving effect to any Extension Period) to the extent that the Trust has funds
available for the payment of such distributions in the Property Account of the
Trust. The Trust's funds available for Distribution to the Holders of the
Capital Securities will be limited to payments received from the Debenture
Issuer. The payment of Distributions out of moneys held by the Trust is
guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

         The Capital Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the
Declaration.

                          [FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY]

         Distributions payable on each Common Security will be payable at an
annual rate equal to 7.35% beginning on (and including) the date of original
issuance and ending on (but excluding) May 15, 2008 and at an annual rate for
each successive Distribution Period beginning on (and including) May 15, 2008,
and each succeeding Distribution Payment Date, and ending on (but excluding) the
next succeeding Distribution Payment Date, equal to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as
described below, plus 4.10% (the "Coupon Rate"), applied to the stated
liquidation amount of $1,000.00 per Common Security, such rate being the rate of
interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee.
Distributions in arrears will bear interest thereon compounded quarterly at the
Distribution Rate (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term
"Distributions" as used herein includes cash distributions and any such
compounded distributions and any Additional Sums payable on the Debentures
unless otherwise noted. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that
payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee
and to the extent the Institutional Trustee has funds available therefor. As
used herein, "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days
(i.e., a business day in which dealings in deposits in U.S. dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the commencement of the
relevant Distribution Period. In the event that any date on which a Distribution
is payable on this Common Security is not a Business Day, then a payment of the
Distribution payable on such date will be made on the next succeeding day which
is a Business Day (and without any interest or other payment in respect of any
such delay), except that, if such Business Day is in the next succeeding
calendar year, such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding Business
Day, in each case with the same force and effect as if made on the date the
payment was originally payable. The amount of the Distribution payable (i) for
any Distribution Period commencing on or after the date of original issuance but
before May 15, 2008 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve
30-day months, and (ii) for the Distribution Period commencing on or after May
15, 2008 and each succeeding Distribution Period will be calculated by applying
the Distribution Rate to the stated liquidation amount outstanding at the
commencement of the Distribution Period and multiplying each such amount by the
actual number of days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360.

         "3-Month LIBOR" as used herein, means the London interbank offered
interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Debenture
Trustee in the following order of priority: (i) the rate (expressed as a
percentage per annum) for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month maturity
that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page
3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate Service or such other page as may replace Page
3750 on that service or such other service or services as may be nominated by
the British Bankers' Association as the information vendor for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits); (ii) if
such rate cannot be identified on the related Determination Date, the Debenture
Trustee will request the principal London offices of four leading banks in the
London interbank market to provide such banks' offered quotations (expressed as
percentages per annum) to prime banks in the London interbank market for U.S.

will request four major New York City banks to provide such banks' offered
quotations (expressed as percentages per annum) to leading European banks for
loans in U.S. dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Determination Date.
If at least two such quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR will be the
arithmetic mean of such quotations; and (iv) if fewer than two such quotations
are provided as requested in clause (iii) above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month
LIBOR determined with respect to the Distribution Period immediately preceding
such current Distribution Period. If the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a
three-month maturity that initially appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00
a.m. (London time) on the related Determination Date is superseded on the
Telerate Page 3750 by a corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such
Determination Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable
page will be the applicable 3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.



                                     A-2-3
<PAGE>


         "Interest Rate" means for the period beginning on (and including) the
date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) May 15, 2008 the rate
per annum of 7.35% and for each Distribution Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All percentages resulting from any calculations on the Common
Securities will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred-thousandth
of a percentage point, with five one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655),
and all dollar amounts used in or resulting from such calculation will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Common
Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance
and will be payable quarterly in arrears on August 15, November 15, February 15
and May 15 of each year, commencing on August 15, 2003. The Debenture Issuer has
the right under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures,
so long as no Indenture Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, by
extending the interest payment period for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods
(each an "Extension Period") at any time and from time to time on the
Debentures, subject to the conditions described below, during which Extension
Period no interest shall be due and payable. During any Extension Period,
interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such accrued
interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Distribution Rate in effect
for such Extension Period, compounded quarterly from the date such interest
would have been payable were it not for the Extension Period, to the extent
permitted by law (such interest referred to herein as "Additional Interest"). No
Extension Period may end on a date other than a Distribution Payment Date. At
the end of any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer shall pay all
interest then accrued and unpaid on the Debentures (together with Additional
Interest thereon); provided, however, that no Extension Period may extend beyond
the Maturity Date. Prior to the termination of any Extension Period, the
Debenture Issuer may further extend such period, provided that such period
together with all such previous and further consecutive extensions thereof shall
not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the Maturity Date.
Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer may commence a
new Extension Period, subject to the foregoing requirements. No interest or
Additional Interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period, except
at the end thereof, but each installment of interest that would otherwise have
been due and payable during such Extension Period shall bear Additional
Interest. During any Extension Period, Distributions on the Common Securities
shall be deferred for a period equal to the Extension Period. If Distributions
are deferred, the





                                     A-2-4
