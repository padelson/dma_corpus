SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT 

  

THIS SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ ") dated as of May 10,
2011, is made by and among IDEX Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("
_Buyer_ "), CVI Laser, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "
_Company_ "), the Persons listed on the signature pages hereto under the
heading "Sellers" (collectively referred to herein as " _Sellers_ " and
individually as a " _Seller_ "), and Norwest Equity Partners VII, LP, as the
Seller Representative (as such term is defined in _Section X.A_ of this
Agreement). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings set forth in _XII_. 

   

RECITALS 

 

WHEREAS, Sellers collectively own all of the issued and outstanding Class A
Units and Class B Units (collectively, the " _Units_ ") of the Company as of
the date of this Agreement. 

  

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, Buyer
desires to acquire from Sellers, and Sellers desire to sell to Buyer, all of
the Units which are issued and outstanding and owned by Sellers as of the
Closing Date. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

I.  

   

PURCHASE AND SALE 

  

 A. Calculation of Purchase Price. 

  

 1\. At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Closing Payment Certificate_ ") setting forth (i) its good faith estimate of Cash On Hand (such estimate is referred to as the " _Estimated Cash On Hand_ "), (ii) its good faith estimate of the Net Working Capital Amount (such estimate is referred to as the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Amount_ "), (iii) its good faith estimate of the Closing Date Indebtedness (such estimate is referred to as the " _Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness_ "), (iv) the aggregate amount of Company Transaction Expenses, (v) the Transaction Payment Amount and (vi) wire instructions for the accounts to which funds are to be wired. 

  

 2\. For purposes hereof, the " _Purchase Price_ " means an amount equal to (A) $400,000,000, _plus_ (B) the Estimated Cash On Hand (which amount may be negative),  _minus_ (C) the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, _plus_ (D) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Target Net Working Capital Amount,  _minus_ (E) the amount, if any, by which the Target Net Working Capital Amount exceeds the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount, _minus_ (F) without duplication, the aggregate amount, if any, of Company Transaction Expenses to be paid by Buyer at the Closing (as detailed in the Closing Payment Certificate), _minus_ (G) the Transaction Payment Amount, _minus_ (H) the Escrow Amount, _minus_ (I) the Seller Representative Holdback. 

  

 B. Purchase and Sale of Securities. As of the Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and convey to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase and acquire from each Seller, all of the Units held by such Seller as such ownership is set forth on _Schedule IV.D_. The consideration to be paid to each Seller in exchange for such Sellers Units shall be an amount of cash equal to such Sellers allocable share of the Purchase Price as set forth on _Schedule B_ (which _Schedule B_ shall be updated at and as of the Closing), which shall be subject to adjustment in accordance with  _Section E_ hereof. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to the Disbursing Agent on behalf of Sellers an amount equal to the Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds so that the Disbursing Agent can pay such cash to each Seller pursuant to the terms of the Disbursing Agent Agreement. 

  

 C. Assumption of Certain Liabilities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree: (a) that the liabilities and other obligations set forth on  _Schedule I.C_ (the " _Assumed Liabilities_ ") are known to Buyer and shall continue to be liabilities and obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries from and after the Closing, (b) that the amounts of the Assumed Liabilities set forth on _Schedule I.C_ reflect the Companys estimate of the amounts of such Assumed Liabilities as of the date hereof (or, if otherwise indicated on such _Schedule I.C_, as of the date so indicated), (c) that the actual amount of such Assumed Liabilities as of the date hereof (or such otherwise indicated date), both on an individual and aggregate basis, may differ from the actual amounts thereof both as of the date of such estimate and, if different, as of the date hereof, and, additionally, such amounts may change over time and (d) that in no event shall the Assumed Liabilities, or any variations to or changes in the amounts of the  Assumed Liabilities (including as between estimated amounts and actual amounts), be subject to any purchase price adjustment under _Section I.E_, indemnification under  _IX_ , or any other recourse against any Seller pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 D. The Closing; Payment for Units, Indebtedness and Company Transaction Expenses; Tax Benefits. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1\. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP located at 355 South Grand Avenue, Los Angeles, California 90071 at 10:00 a.m. (Albuquerque time) on the second Business Day following satisfaction or waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in _II_  (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) or on such other date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and the Seller Representative. The date on which the Closing shall occur is referenced herein as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

  

 2\. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, the parties hereto shall consummate the following transactions as of the Closing:  

   

 Buyer shall deliver the Purchase Price to the Disbursing Agent in accordance with  _Section B_ in exchange for the Units held by each Seller;  

   

 Buyer shall deliver the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent in accordance with  _Section I.F_; 

   

 Buyer shall repay, or cause to be repaid, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries set forth on _Schedule 0_ , in each case, in such amounts as are then outstanding as of immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with the terms thereof (and to the extent available, any payoff letters with respect thereto), by wire transfer of immediately available funds (the " _Indebtedness Payoff Amount_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding its inclusion on _Schedule 0_, Buyer may elect to assume all obligations under (and shall not then be required to repay or cause to be repaid) the Industrial Revenue Bonds, series 1998, issued by the City of Albuquerque, New Mexico; and  

   

 Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, on behalf of Sellers and the Company, the Company Transaction Expenses (as detailed in the Closing Payment Certificate) by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts specified in the Closing Payment Certificate. 

  

 3\. Sellers acknowledge that they will have no claims against Buyer with respect to (i) payments that have been actually wired by Buyer to the Disbursing Agent pursuant to _Section 0_ or to the Seller Representative pursuant to _Section E.3_, in each case upon receipt by such Person, or (ii) any division of such payments among Sellers thereafter, except, in each case, to the extent any payments by Buyer are insufficient to satisfy its obligations under, or otherwise result in a breach or violation of, the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 4\. Any Tax benefit arising from the payment of the Indebtedness Payoff Amount (exclusive of the step-up in basis of the assets attributable thereto) and any Company Transaction Expenses shall be allocated to Sellers. 

  

 E. Final Cash On Hand, Net Working Capital and Indebtedness Calculations. 

  

 1\. _Determination_. As promptly as possible, but in any event within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Seller Representative will deliver to Buyer an audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of the Determination Moment (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), prepared, at Buyers expense, in accordance with GAAP applied consistently with the Companys Accounting Practices and Procedures, and a reasonably detailed statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth the Seller Representatives calculations of Cash On Hand, the Closing Date Indebtedness and the Net Working Capital Amount prepared based on the Closing Balance Sheet. From the Closing until the delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, the Seller Representative and its auditors, accountants and other representatives shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to the Companys and its Subsidiaries auditors, accountants, facilities, personnel, books and records and other documents in connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. In connection with the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet, KPMG LLP will perform a review of the inventory of the Company and its Subsidiaries consistent with the standard inventory work performed by KPMG LLP in connection with an audit, as set forth on _Schedule E_, which review will be performed at Buyers sole expense and the results of which will be included in the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent of any inconsistency between generally accepted auditing standards (" _GAAS_ ") necessary to issue financial statements in accordance with GAAP and _Schedule 1.05_, the  GAAS requirements shall control. After delivery of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, Buyer and its accountants shall be permitted reasonable access during normal business hours to review the work papers, if any, of the Seller Representative (including any work papers of the Seller Representatives accountants) related to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet and the Closing Statement, subject to such confidentiality restrictions as the Seller Representative or its accountants shall reasonably request. Buyer and its accountants may make inquiries of the Seller Representative and its accountants regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the Closing Statement arising in the course of its review thereof, and the Seller Representative shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such accountants to, cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If Buyer has any objections to the Closing Statement, Buyer shall deliver to the Seller Representative a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the item in dispute, the amount thereof in dispute and the basis for its objections thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not delivered to the Seller Representative within 30 days after delivery of the Closing Statement (or if access to the work papers as described above is requested, within 30 days after such access is granted), the Closing Statement shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto. The Seller Representative and Buyer 

   ##### 

  

    

shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any objections set forth in the
Objections Statement (and all such discussions related thereto shall, unless
otherwise agreed by the Seller Representative and Buyer, be governed by Rule
408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (and any applicable similar state
rule)), but if they do not reach a final resolution within 15 days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller Representative and
Buyer shall submit such dispute to PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP (the "
_Independent Auditor_ "). If any dispute is submitted to the Independent
Auditor, each party will furnish to the Independent Auditor such work papers
and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues as
the Independent Auditor may request and are available to that party or its
independent accountants (including information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) and each party shall be afforded the opportunity to present the
Independent Auditor material relating to the determination and to discuss the
determination with the Independent Auditor. The Independent Auditor shall not
act as an arbitrator and shall resolve only those matters that remain in
dispute after the 15-day resolution period. It is the intent of Buyer and the
Company that the process set forth in this  _Section I.E_ and the activities
of the Independent Auditor in connection herewith are not intended to be and,
in fact, are not arbitration and that no formal arbitration rules shall
be followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The
Seller Representative and Buyer shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Independent Auditor to resolve all such disagreements as
soon as practicable but in no event later than 30 days after submission of
the disputed issues to the Independent Auditor. The resolution of the dispute
by the Independent Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on the
parties hereto. The Closing Statement shall be modified if necessary to
reflect such determination. The fees and expenses of the Independent Auditor
shall be allocated to be paid by Buyer, on the one hand, and/or the
Seller Representative (which amount may be paid from the Seller
Representative Holdback), on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party, as determined by the
Independent Auditor. 

  

 2\. _Adjustments_.  

  

 _Cash On Hand Adjustment_. If the Cash On Hand as finally determined pursuant to  _Section I.E.1_ above is greater than the Estimated Cash On Hand, Buyer or the Company shall pay to each Seller such Sellers Percentage Share of such excess in accordance with _Section I.E.3_. If the Cash On Hand as finally determined pursuant to _Section I.E.1_ above is less than the Estimated Cash On Hand, Buyer shall be paid such shortfall in accordance with  _Section I.E.3_. 

  

 _Net Working Capital Adjustment_. If the positive difference between Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section I.E.1_ above and the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is greater than $1,000,000, Buyer or the Company shall pay to each Seller such Sellers Percentage Share of such excess over $1,000,000 in accordance with _Section I.E.3_. If the absolute value of the negative difference between Net Working Capital Amount as finally determined pursuant to _Section I.E.1_ above and the Estimated Net Working Capital Amount is greater than $1,000,000, Buyer shall be paid such excess over $1,000,000 in accordance with _Section I.E.3_. 

  

 _Closing Date Indebtedness Adjustment_. If the Closing Date Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to _Section I.E.1_ above is less than the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, Buyer or the Company shall pay to each Seller such Sellers Percentage Share of such shortfall in accordance with _Section I.E.3_. If the Closing Date Indebtedness as finally determined pursuant to _Section I.E.1_ above is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Indebtedness, Buyer shall be paid such excess in accordance with _Section I.E.3_. 

  

 3\. _Final Adjustment Amount_. Without duplication, all amounts owed pursuant to  _Sections 0_, _0_ , and _0_ shall be aggregated, and the net amount (if any) owed by Buyer to Sellers, on the one hand, or from the Escrow Fund to Buyer, on the other hand, shall be referred to as the " _Final Adjustment Amount_ "; it being understood and agreed that if the net effect pursuant to this _Section I.E.3_ is an increase in the total consideration payable by Buyer, then Buyer shall make a cash payment to the Disbursing Agent in an amount equal to such Final Adjustment Amount, and if the net effect pursuant to this _Section I.E.3_ is a decrease in the total consideration payable by Buyer, then the Seller Representative shall cause to be paid to Buyer from the Escrow Fund an aggregate amount equal to the Final Adjustment Amount; provided that to the extent such Final Adjustment Amount to be paid to Buyer exceeds the Escrow Fund, each Seller shall pay to Buyer such Sellers Percentage Share of such excess. The Final Adjustment Amount shall be treated as an adjustment to the total consideration paid by  Buyer. Payment of the Final Adjustment Amount shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Buyer, in the case of any payment to Buyer, and the Seller Representative, in the case of any payment to the Sellers, within five business days after the date of final determination.  

  

 F. Escrow Amount. The " _Escrow Amount_ " shall initially be an aggregate amount equal to $20,000,000, subject to replenishment pursuant to the terms of this _Section F_, and shall be released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. In the event that the Final Adjustment Amount (a) decreases the Purchase Price, (b) is paid to Buyer from the Escrow Fund in accordance with _Section I.E.3_, and (c) is greater than $3,000,000 in the aggregate, then, within 15 days of the payment of the Final Adjustment Amount by the Escrow Agent, the Seller Representative shall deliver to the Escrow Agent from the Seller Representative Holdback an amount equal to the amount by which the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds $3,000,000 (the " _Replenishment Amount_ "); _provided_ that in no event shall the Replenishment Amount delivered by the Seller Representative reduce the funds remaining in the Seller Representative Holdback to an amount less than $1,000,000 (the " _Holdback Floor_ "); _provided_ _further_ that in no event shall the Replenishment Amount delivered by the Seller Representative exceed $2,000,000 in the aggregate (the " _Replenishment Cap_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, neither the Seller Representative nor the Sellers shall have any 

   ##### 

  

    

obligation to replenish the Escrow Fund (i) in the event that the Final
Adjustment Amount is $3,000,000 or less in the aggregate or (ii) for
any portion of the Final Adjustment Amount paid to Buyer from the Escrow Fund
in excess of the Replenishment Cap. 

  

II.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall restrict the ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries from terminating the employment of a Company Employee after the Closing in accordance with applicable law. 

  

 2. For purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting under Buyer Plans, as hereafter defined, each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her period of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, before the Closing Date, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan, except to the extent that such credit would result in a duplication of benefits and except for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan not maintained or contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Buyer Plans_ " means the employee benefit and compensation plans and programs maintained by Buyer and its Affiliates after the Closing Date for the benefit of Company Employees, but specifically excluding each Employee Benefit Plan and Foreign Plan.

   ##### 

  

 

provided that such expenses shall not be taken into account to the extent
such recognition would result in a duplication of benefits. 

   

 3. No Person (including any Company Employee, any Employee Benefit Plan, Foreign Plan or any trustee or beneficiary thereof) shall (i) have any rights under this Agreement as a third-party beneficiary or (ii) have any express or implied rights or remedies of any nature under or by reason of this Section 5.03, and no provision in this Agreement shall constitute an amendment of any Employee Benefit Plan or Foreign Plan. 

  

 4. The parties hereto acknowledge that prior to the Closing, the Company shall make a payment to each Company Employee who participates in the Companys 2011 annual performance bonus and sales program in an amount equal to the pro rata portion (calculated based on the number of days from January 1, 2011 through and including the Closing Date divided by 365) of such Company Employees 2011 annual performance bonus and sales program performance or, as applicable, sales bonus, based on one hundred percent (100%) achievement of the performance objectives under the Companys 2011 annual performance bonus and sales program, for which such Company Employee would have been eligible and had such Company Employee remained employed by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, through December 31, 2011 and such performance, or, as applicable, sales objectives been  achieved. For the avoidance of doubt, the payments made pursuant to this _Section VII.F.4_ do not include or reflect any amounts payable to Company Employees as part of the Transaction Payment Amount. 

  

 5. Subject to applicable Legal Requirements, the parties shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, mutually cooperate in undertaking all reasonably necessary or legally required provision of information to, or consultations, discussions or negotiations with, any union, works council, labor organization or other employee representative group regarding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 G. Payment of Dividend. To the extent, and only to the extent, that (a) following the Closing, the Company receives any amounts in cash in the form of dividends, repatriations, returns of capital, recapitalization proceeds or other distributions (collectively, " _Distributions_ ") from any of its Subsidiaries and (b) prior to the Closing, the payment of such Distribution (i) was authorized by such Subsidiary and (ii) if required by the laws of the jurisdiction in which such Subsidiary is organized, received approval from, or otherwise was submitted for approval to, the governmental authority in such jurisdiction which oversees or otherwise regulates the payment of such Distributions, then the Company shall pay as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 20 days) after receipt thereof by the Company, to the Seller Representative on behalf of Sellers an amount equal to the amount of any Distribution (net of any foreign withholding taxes or U.S. federal or state income taxes payable after the Closing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such Distribution, taking into account on a with and without basis any reduction in Tax liability (including, without limitation, foreign tax credits) available to Buyer, any of its Subsidiaries, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such taxes payable) (a " _Dividend Payment_ ") received by the Company.  _Schedule VII.G_, which shall be updated at and as of the Closing, sets forth a list of all such Distributions and, to the extent known, the amount of the anticipated Dividend Payment with respect thereto (and if not known, a good faith estimate thereof). The Seller Representative shall pay to each Seller an amount equal to such Sellers Percentage Share of any Dividend Payment (less any costs incurred by the Seller Representative in making such payments) by wire transfer of immediately available funds. 

  

 H. Confidentiality. Sellers have had access to, and have gained knowledge with respect to the Business, including without limitation trade secrets, financial results and information, processes and techniques, technical production and cost data, methods of doing business and information concerning customers and suppliers, and other valuable and confidential information relating to the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the "Confidential Information"). Sellers acknowledge that unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the Confidential Information, whether before or after the Closing, will cause irreparable damage to the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company and Buyer subsequent to the Closing. The parties also agree that covenants by Sellers not to make unauthorized disclosures of the Confidential Information are essential to the growth and stability of the business of the Company, the Subsidiaries of the Company and Buyer. Each Seller severally agrees that he or she will not use or disclose any Confidential Information obtained in the course of his, her or its, as the case may be, past connection with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than (a) information generally available to the public through sources other than Sellers, (b) information acquired after the Closing on a non-confidential basis from a third party source that is not prohibited from disclosing such information to such Person, (c) information independently developed by such Seller without the use of or reference to any Confidential Information, (d) in connection with the performance of obligations, if any, as an employee of the Corporation or Subsidiary of the Company, (e) to defend or participate in the defense of actions as to which the indemnification provisions of _Section 9.02(a)_, or in connection with Tax reporting and related Tax matters associated with the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company, or (f) as required by law or order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

 B. Indemnification for the Benefit of Buyer. 

  

 1. Subject to provisions of this IX, from and after the Closing, Buyer, its Subsidiaries, the Company and its Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") shall be indemnified by Sellers to the extent provided in this _IX_ against any Losses which the Buyer Indemnified Parties suffer as a result of (i) any breach by any Seller of any representation and warranty of such Seller contained in _III_ , (ii) any breach by the Company of any representation and warranty of the Company contained in _IV_ or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of the Company hereunder at or prior to the Closing; provided that Losses attributable to Taxes described in  _Section IX.B.1(iii)_ shall be indemnified pursuant to that provision only, (iii) any Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for (A) any taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (a " _Pre-Closing Tax Period_ "), (B) any taxable period beginning before or on and ending after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ ") to the extent allocable pursuant to  _Section XI.C.2_ to the period ending on or before the Closing Date and (C) the sale by Sellers of the Units, but in the case of  

   ##### 

  

 

each of clauses (A), (B) and (C) only to the extent that such Taxes exceed
the Net Tax Reserve Amount, (iv) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant
or agreement, set forth in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by
a Seller, or (v) the matters set forth on _Schedule IX.B.1(v)_ (the "
_Specific Indemnification Items_ "). 

   

 2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except in the case of Losses attributable to (i) Taxes described in _Section IX.B.1(iii)_, (ii) breaches of the representations and warranties contained in _Section III.C_ (Ownership of the Units), (iii) breaches of the representations and warranties contained in subsection (a) of _Section IV.D_ (Capitalization and Related Matters), or (iv) the non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or,  agreement set forth in this Agreement to be fulfilled by a Seller (collectively, the " _Special Losses_ "), the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive recourse against the Sellers under this _Section B_ shall be from the Escrow Fund and Sellers shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment out of the Escrow Fund for any such Losses suffered by any Buyer Indemnified Party. For any Special Losses suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Party in excess of the product of (x) the remaining balance in the Escrow Fund and (y) such Sellers proportionate ownership of the Company as set forth on _Schedule 4.04_ (in the case of clause (ii) above) or after the expiration of the Escrow Fund, Sellers shall be severally, but not jointly, liable for the payment of (A) such Sellers Percentage Share of any such Special Losses (in the case of clauses (i), (iii) and (iv) above) or (B) the amount of such Special Losses (in the event of clause (ii) above). Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the representations and warranties contained in _III_ that relate specifically and solely to a particular Seller are the obligations of that particular Seller only and the other Sellers shall not be responsible therefore. The particular Seller making any such representation or warranty contained in this Agreement shall be solely responsible for any Losses the Buyer Indemnified Parties suffer as a result of any breach of any such representations and warranties by such Seller, and the full amount of any such Losses shall, to the extent paid to Buyer from the Escrow Fund, be promptly paid by such Seller directly to the Seller Representative, which shall thereafter pay such amount to each other Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by such other Seller, in accordance with such other Sellers Percentage Share (less such other Sellers Percentage Share of any costs incurred by the Seller Representative in making such payments). In no event, except in the case of Special Losses, shall the aggregate liability of any Seller for all Losses claimed by the Buyer Indemnified Parties against such Seller under _Sections IX.B.1_ and _2_  exceed such Sellers Percentage Share of the Escrow Fund. 

  

 3. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers shall not have any liability under _Sections IX.B.1(i)_ and _(ii)_ above, unless the aggregate of all Losses relating thereto for which Sellers would be liable, but for this Section, exceeds on a cumulative basis $2,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ ") and then only to the extent such Losses exceed the Deductible; _provided_ that the Deductible shall not apply to Losses based upon, attributable to or resulting from (i) breaches of the representations and warranties contained in _Section III.C_ (Ownership of the Units), subsection (b) of _Section IV.B_ (Subsidiaries), subsections (a)(ii) and (c) of _Section IV.D_ (Capitalization and Related Matters) and _Section IV.H_ (Tax Matters) and (ii) the Specific Indemnification Items, each of which shall be indemnifiable by the Sellers from the first dollar of such Losses;  _provided_ , _further_ , that Sellers aggregate liability under _Section IX.B.1_ and _2_ shall in no event exceed $20,000,000 (the " _Cap_ "), except in the case of Losses attributable to breaches of the representations and warranties contained in (A) _Section III.C_ , which liability, for each Seller, shall not exceed an amount equal to the aggregate proceeds received by such Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (B) clause (ii) of Section _IV.D.1_ (Capitalization and Related Matters), which liability for each Seller shall equal such Sellers Percentage Share of such Losses up to, but in no event exceeding, an amount equal to the aggregate proceeds received by such Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 4. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the Sellers shall not be liable to, or indemnify, the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses (i) to the extent and only to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of actions taken by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates from and after the Closing Date, (ii) to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of any Assumed Liabilities, (iii) to the extent that such Losses result from or arise out of any reduction in, or limitation on the use of, any net operating loss carryover or credit carryover or similar Tax attribute of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to a Pre-Closing Period, except to the extent such reduction or limitation results in a Tax liability which is subject to indemnification pursuant to _Section IX.B.1(iii)_, or (iv) with respect to any amount that was taken into account in the final determination of Net Working Capital, Closing Date Indebtedness, Company Transaction Expenses or the Transaction Payment Amount pursuant to  _Section I.E_ hereof. This _Section IX.B_ constitutes the Buyer Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than in the case of fraud and the adjustment provisions of _I_ ). 

  

 5. Nothing contained herein shall modify any obligations under common law of the Buyer Indemnified Parties to mitigate Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 6. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties had already recovered Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 C. Indemnification for the Benefit of the Sellers. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1. From and after the Closing Date, Buyer and the Company shall jointly and severally indemnify Sellers and their respective officers, directors, partners, members, employees, agents, representatives (excluding the Seller Representative, solely in its capacity as the Seller Representative and not as a Seller), successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") against any Losses which the Seller Indemnified Parties suffer as a result of (i) any breach of any representation or warranty of Buyer under this Agreement or any certificate delivered by or on behalf of Buyer hereunder, or (ii) any non- fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement to be performed by Buyer and/or, from and after the Closing, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 2. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the aggregate liability of Buyer and the Company under _Section IX.C.1_ shall in no event exceed the Cap. 

  

 3. This _Section IX.C_ constitutes the Seller Indemnified Parties sole and exclusive remedy for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising from this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (other than in the case of fraud and the adjustment provisions of _I_ ). 

  

 4. Nothing contained herein shall modify any obligations under common law of the Seller Indemnified Parties to mitigate Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event which would reasonably be expected to give rise to Losses subject to indemnification hereunder. 

  

 5. The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover any Losses relating to any matter arising under one provision of this Agreement to the extent that the Seller Indemnified Parties had already recovered Losses with respect to such matter pursuant to other provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 D. Special Rule for Fraud. Notwithstanding anything in this _IX_ to the contrary, in the event of any breach of a representation or warranty by any party hereto that constitutes fraud, by or on behalf of any Seller or the Company (prior to Closing) in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, on the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, then (a) the limitations set forth in _Section IX.B.2_, _Section IX.B.3_ or  _Section IX.C.2_ (as the case may be) shall not apply to any Loss that the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as the case may be, may suffer, sustain or become subject to, as a result of, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any such breach;  _provided_ that in no event shall the aggregate liability for Losses under this _Section IX.D_ for each Seller, exceed the aggregate proceeds received by such Seller in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) none of such Losses shall count towards the satisfaction of the Deductible. 

  

 E. Manner of Payment. Any indemnification payment pursuant to this _XI_ shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from the applicable indemnifying party to an account designated by each applicable indemnified party within 20 days after the determination thereof. Any payments required to be made by Sellers in satisfaction of claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section IX.B.1_ and _B.2_ shall be paid first from the Escrow Fund, to the extent of the available funds in the Escrow Fund. 

  

 F. Defense of Third-Party Claims. 

  

 1. Any Person making a claim for indemnification under _Section IX.B_ or  _Section IX.C_ (an " _Indemnitee_ ") shall notify the indemnifying party (an " _Indemnitor_ ") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving notice of any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation, demand or other claim against the Indemnitee (if by a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable) and the basis thereof in reasonable detail (such written notice, an " _Indemnification Notice_ "); _provided_   _that_ the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent and only to the extent that such failure shall have caused the damages for which the Indemnitor is obligated to be greater than such damages would have been had the Indemnitee given the Indemnitor prompt notice hereunder.  

  

 2. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim giving rise to an Indemnitees claim for indemnification at such Indemnitors expense, or at its option assume the defense thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnitor shall not have the right to assume control of the defense of such claim, and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to all Indemnitees arising out of the same or similar set of circumstances in connection with such defense, if such claim (i) involves a criminal allegation by a governmental authority, (ii) involves a claim, which, if adversely determined, would be reasonably expected to materially affect the ability of Buyer and the Company to operate the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course and consistent with past practices, (iii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Loss (including the cost of defense) which exceeds one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of the excess of (x) the amount, if any, then remaining in the Escrow Fund, over (y) the amount of Losses (including costs of defense) which could reasonably be expected to be paid in satisfaction of any pending but unresolved claims for indemnification, (iv) involves, in the opinion of counsel of the Indemnitee, a conflict of interest between the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee, (v) in the written opinion of independent counsel, is not being vigorously defended by the Indemnitor such claim, or (vi) involves any matter described in item 2 of _Schedule 9.02(a)(v)_ (clauses (i) through (vi), the " _Exception Claims_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the contrary, (1) all costs of any such defense or any settlement by the Seller Representative, including reasonable attorneys fees, accountants fees and any other reasonable fees and expenses related to any such defense, shall be indemnifiable  

   ##### 

  

 

 Losses and shall be paid from the Escrow Fund and (2) the Indemnitor shall
not assume control of the defense of any third-party claim unless the
Indemnitor shall agree in writing to indemnify the Indemnitee for  all
Losses attributable to such third-party claim subject to the terms of this
Agreement, including the limitations set forth in _Section IX.B.2_, _Section
IX.B.3_ and  _Section C.2_ (as the case may be). 

   

 3. If (i) the Indemnitor shall not assume the defense of any such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, (ii) such claim is an Exception Claim or (iii) Indemnitor fails to agree to indemnify the Indemnitor for all Losses attributed to such third-party claim (subject to the terms of this Agreement, including the limitations set forth in _Section IX.B.2_ , _Section IX.B.3_ and _Section C.2_ (as the case may be)), in each case, the Indemnitee may defend against such matter as it deems appropriate at the expense of the Indemnitor;  _provided_ _that_ the Indemnitor shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitor and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnitee or the Escrow Fund under this _IX_ ; _provided_   _further_ that the Indemnitee may not settle any such matter, other than an Exception Claim that does not solely involve monetary damages, without the written consent of the Indemnitor (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) if the Indemnitee is seeking or will seek indemnification hereunder with respect to such matter.  

  

 4. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; _provided_ , _however_ , that the fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee and shall not be recoverable from such Indemnitor under this _IX_. If the Indemnitor assumes the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any amount required to be paid by the Indemnitee that exceeds, where the Indemnitee has unreasonably withheld or delayed consent in connection with the proposed compromise or settlement of a third-party claim where the remedy is solely monetary damages and no equitable remedy and where the settlement includes as a term thereof a full release of the Indemnitee, the amount for which that third-party claim could have been settled pursuant to that proposed compromise or settlement. If the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such claims; _provided_   _that_ the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing to defend such claim. In all cases, the Indemnitee shall provide its reasonable cooperation with the Indemnitor in defense of claims or litigation, including by making employees, information and documentation reasonably available. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this  _Section F_ and _Section XI.C.7_, the provisions of _Section XI.C.7_ shall govern. 

  

 G. Determination of Loss Amount. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under _Section IX.B_ or _Section IX.C_ shall be calculated net of (i) solely in the case of Losses attributable to any foreign Subsidiary of the Company, any Tax Benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates as a result of such Loss, (ii) any reserves set forth in the Closing Balance Sheet and/or the Closing Statement and included in the Net Working Capital Amount relating specifically to the matter with respect to which such Loss relates and (iii) any insurance proceeds (net of retrospective premium payments or prospective premium increases) or other amounts under indemnification agreements actually received by the Indemnitee on account of such Loss. If, after an indemnification payment is made to the Indemnitee in respect of a Loss attributable to any foreign Subsidiary of the Company, the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates receives a Tax Benefit on account of such Loss that was not fully deducted from such indemnification payment, Buyer or the indemnified Seller (as applicable) shall, or shall cause the recipient of such undeducted Tax Benefit to, promptly pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount of such undeducted Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such undeducted Tax Benefit is actually realized by such recipient. For purposes of this _Section IX.G_, " _Tax Benefit_ " shall mean any refund of Taxes to be paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would be paid by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, in each case computed at the highest marginal tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. Buyer or the indemnified Seller (as applicable) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance or other recovery is made by any Indemnitee with respect to any Loss for which any such Person has received indemnity payments hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the actual recovery shall be made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to such Indemnitee. The Indemnitors shall be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitees in respect of any Losses indemnified by the Indemnitors. 

  

 H. Termination of Indemnification. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall terminate when the applicable representation or warranty or covenant or agreement terminates pursuant to _Section IX.A_; _provided_ , _however_ , that such obligations to indemnify and hold harmless shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the party to be indemnified shall have, prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, previously made a claim by delivering a written notice (stating in reasonable detail the nature of, and factual and legal basis for, any such claim for indemnification, and the provisions of this Agreement upon which such claim for indemnification is made) to the indemnifying party. 

  

 I. Limitation on Recourse. No claim shall be brought or maintained by Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any officer, director or employee (present or former) of any Seller in its capacity as such or any Affiliate of any Seller unless a party to this Agreement as a Seller, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or contained in this Agreement or any exhibit or schedule hereto or any certificate delivered hereunder. 

  

 J. Characterization of Payments. For Tax purposes, the parties agree to treat all payments made under this _IX_ as adjustments to the total consideration payable by Buyer for the Units. All such payments relating to foreign Subsidiaries of the Company shall be treated as adjustments to the consideration allocable to such foreign Subsidiaries, and all such payments relating to the U.S. operations of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company shall be treated as an adjustment to the consideration allocable to
the assets directly held within the Company (and not within any Subsidiary of
the Company).

SELLER REPRESENTATIVE 

  

 A. Designation. Each of the Sellers does hereby designate Norwest Equity Partners, VII, LP as the " _Seller Representative_ " to serve as the representative of the Sellers with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be performed by the Seller Representative. Should the Seller Representative resign or be unable to serve, the Seller Representative shall appoint a single substitute agent to take on the responsibility of the Seller Representative hereunder, whose appointment shall be effective on the date of the Seller Representatives resignation or incapacity. 

  

 B. Authority. Each of the Sellers, by the execution of this Agreement, hereby irrevocably appoints the Seller Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney in fact for such Seller for all purposes of this Agreement, including the full power and authority on such Sellers behalf (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated herein and any post-Closing matters; (ii) to pay the Sellers expenses incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of this Agreement (whether incurred before, on or after the date of this Agreement); (iii) to disburse any funds received hereunder to such Seller and each other Seller; (iv) to endorse and deliver any certificates or instruments representing the Units and execute such further instruments of assignment as Buyer or the Company shall reasonably request; (v) to execute and deliver on behalf of such Seller any amendment or waiver in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements or documents contemplated hereby as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or desirable; (vi) to prepare, revise, supplement, update or amend any schedule, exhibit or other document required to be delivered by or under this Agreement, including _Schedule I.B_ , (vii) to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Escrow Agreement (with such modifications or changes therein as to which the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, shall have consented) and to agree to and enter into any such amendments or modifications thereto as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, determines to be desirable; (viii) to take all actions necessary to cause, as necessary, the Escrow Fund to be replenished in accordance with _Section I.F_ hereof; (ix) to take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Seller in connection herewith; (x) to do each and every act and exercise any and all rights which such Seller(s) collectively are permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement; and (xi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver the Escrow Agreement and all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, schedules, exhibits, letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all action that the Seller Representative, in its sole and absolute discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and all other agreements and documents referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith and therewith, including, retaining counsel, accountants and other experts, incurring fees and expenses, asserting or pursuing any claim, action, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ ") against Buyer, the Company and/or any Seller, defending any Claims by the Buyer Indemnified Parties or third-party claims pursuant to _IX_ hereof, consenting to, compromising or settling any such Claims, conducting negotiations with Buyer, the Company and their respective representatives regarding such Claims, it being understood that the Seller Representative shall not have any obligation to take any such actions, and shall not have any liability for any failure to take any such actions. Each of the Sellers agrees that such agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable without the consent of the Seller Representative and shall survive the death, incapacity, bankruptcy, dissolution or liquidation of any Seller. All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative (to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller Representative shall not take any such action where (x) any single Seller would be held solely liable for a Loss (without such Sellers consent) or (y) such action materially and adversely affects the substantive rights or obligations of one Seller, or group of the Sellers, without a similar proportionate effect upon the substantive rights or obligations of all Sellers, unless each such disproportionately affected Seller consents in writing thereto. 

  

 C. Authority; Indemnification. Each Seller agrees that Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to rely on any action taken or omission to act by the Seller Representative, on behalf of such Seller, pursuant to _Section X.B_ above (an " _Authorized Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each Seller as fully as if such Seller had taken such Authorized Action. In no event shall Buyer or the Company, any of their Affiliates, have any liability to any Seller for any action taken or omission to act by the Seller Representative. Buyer agrees, for itself and the Company, that the Seller Representative, in its capacity as the Seller Representative, shall have no liability to Buyer or the Company for any Authorized Action, to the extent that such Authorized Action was taken or omitted in good faith and not in a manner constituting fraud or willful misconduct. Each Seller hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Representative against all expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with any action, suit or proceeding to which the Seller Representative is made a party by reason of the fact it is or was acting as the Seller Representative pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and any expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in connection with the performance of its duties hereunder. 

  

 D. Seller Representative Holdback. The Seller Representative shall not be entitled to any fee, commission or other compensation for the performance of its services hereunder, but shall be entitled to the payment of all expenses incurred as the Seller Representative (it being understood that in no event shall Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates be liable for any such payment and, except as set forth below, the Escrow Fund shall not be used to make any such payments). In connection with the foregoing, on or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver $4,000,000 (the " _Seller Representative Holdback_ ") to the Seller Representative to be used by the Seller Representative to (a) pay any expenses incurred by the Seller Representative in its capacity as the Seller Representative, including, but not limited to, any attorneys, accountants and other experts fees and (b) to replenish the Escrow Fund, as applicable, from the Seller Representative Holdback in accordance with _Section I.F_. Immediately following the first to occur of (x) the payment of the Final Adjustment Amount by the Escrow Agent and, as applicable, the Replenishment Amount, if any, by the Seller Representative, or (y) the final determination that the Final Adjustment Amount is equal to zero, the Seller Representative will distribute to the Sellers their applicable pro rata portion (based on their Percentage Share of the Seller Representative Holdback) of the amount by which the unused amounts of the Seller Representative Holdback 

   ##### 

  

 

exceed the Holdback Floor, without any interest (the " _Initial
Holdback Distribution_ "). Following the Initial Holdback Distribution, at
such time as the Seller Representative determines, in its sole discretion,
that the Seller Representative will not incur any additional expenses in its
capacity as representative, then the Seller Representative will distribute to
the Sellers their applicable pro rata portion (based on their Percentage Share
of the Seller Representative Holdback) of the remaining unused amounts of
the Seller Representative Holdback, if any, without interest. In connection
with defending any third-party claims pursuant to _Section IX.F_, the Seller
Representative shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Escrow Fund at any
time upon written request from the Seller Representative for costs and
expenses (including, legal fees, disbursements and expenses) incurred by the
Seller Representative in its representative capacity. Buyer shall cause the
Escrow Agent to pay any amount requested by the Seller Representative as
promptly as practicable, but in no event more than five business days after
the Seller Representative request therefor, which request shall include wire
transfer instructions. 

   

 E. Exculpation. The Seller Representative shall not have by reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller, except in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Seller. The Seller Representative shall not be liable to any Seller for any action taken or omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any other document entered into in connection herewith, except that the Seller Representative shall not be relieved of any liability imposed by law for willful misconduct. The Seller Representative shall not be liable to Sellers for any apportionment or distribution of payments made by the Seller Representative in good faith, and if any such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error the sole recourse of any Seller to whom payment was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other Sellers any payment in excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The Seller Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Seller Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any Seller by virtue of the failure or refusal of the Seller Representative for any reason to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of its other duties hereunder, except for actions or omissions constituting fraud or willful misconduct. 

  

 F. Survival. All of the indemnities, immunities and powers granted to the Seller Representative under this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and/or any termination of this Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

Accordingly, none of the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Sellers makes any representations or warranties whatsoever with respect to such estimates, projections and other forecasts and plans (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts). Except in the case of fraud, Buyer agrees that none of the Sellers (other than as otherwise set forth herein) nor any of their Affiliates will have or be subject to any liability to Buyer, the Company or any other Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer, or

 C. Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and Sellers for certain tax matters following the Closing Date: 

  

 1. _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. 

   

 The Seller Representative shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods which are not filed or otherwise due as of the Closing Date. At least 15 days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is filed, the Seller Representative shall submit such Tax Return to Buyer for its review and comment, and the Seller Representative shall make such revisions to such Tax Return as are reasonably requested by Buyer and received by Seller at least ten days prior to the date on which such Tax Return is filed (but Seller Representative shall be under no obligation to accept any comments that relate to positions taken on such Tax Return that are prepared in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and otherwise consistent with past practice). At least five days before the date on which any such Tax Return is due, the Seller Representative shall deliver such Tax Return to Buyer for filing. Buyer shall timely file or cause to be timely filed such Tax Return and shall pay all Taxes reflected on such Tax Return, subject to Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to _Section IX.B.1(iii)_ for the portion of such Taxes owing in excess of the Net Tax Reserve Amount. 

   

 Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared in accordance with the past practice of the Company and its Subsidiaries (except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements), and timely file or cause to be timely filed, all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all Straddle Periods. At least 15 days prior to the date on which each such Tax Return is filed, Buyer shall submit such Tax Return to the Seller Representative for its review and approval, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such approval may be withheld if such Tax Return has not been prepared in accordance with past practice (except to the extent otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements) and the filing of such Tax Return is reasonably expected by the Seller Representative to adversely affect the Tax liability, the amount received under this Agreement or the indemnification obligation, in each case, of any Seller. Buyer shall pay all Taxes reflected on such Tax Returns, subject to Buyers right to indemnification pursuant to _Section IX.B.1(iii)_ for the portion of such Taxes owing in excess of the Net Tax Reserve Amount. 

  

 2. _Straddle Periods_. With respect to any Straddle Period, the portion of any Tax that is allocable to the taxable period that is deemed to end on the Closing Date will be: (i) in the case of real property Taxes, personal property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes, deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date. 

  

 3. _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds that are received by Buyer (other than those attributable to net operating losses carry backs from periods after the Closing), the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that relate to Taxes for either the Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period (to the extent allocable pursuant to _Section XI.C.2_ to the period ending on or before the Closing Date) shall be for the account of Sellers to the extent not already credited in Sellers favor as part of the calculation of the Net Working Capital Amount, and Buyer shall pay over to the Seller Representative any such refund within 15 days after receipt thereof, net of reasonable expenses of collection and, where applicable, all Tax liability incurred in respect of such refunds. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any refunds are received by the Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing in respect of foreign withholding Taxes or U.S. federal or state income Taxes imposed on any dividends or other distributions received by the Company from any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing or imposed on any Dividend Payments described in _Section VII.G_ (including, without limitation, any excess withheld amounts refunded upon establishment of eligibility for reduced withholding rates under an applicable Tax treaty), such refunds shall be paid over to the Seller Representative within 15 days after receipt thereof.  

  

 4. _Cooperation on Tax Matters_.  

   

 Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, Sellers and the Seller Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this _Section XI.C_ and any audit, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Company and its Subsidiaries, Sellers and the Seller Representative agree (A) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the 

   ##### 

  

   

Company and its Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to
the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers or the Seller Representative, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any Tax authority, and (B) to
give the other party at least 30 days  written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party
so requests, the Company and its Subsidiaries, or Sellers or the Seller
Representative, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to
take possession of such books and records. 

   

 Buyer and the Seller Representative further agree, upon request, to provide the other party with all information (in their respective possession) that either party may be required to report pursuant to Code §6043A and all Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. 

  

 5. _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. All tax-sharing agreements or similar agreements with respect to or involving the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any liability thereunder. 

  

 6. _Transfer Taxes_. The cost of any documentary, stamp, stock transfer, or similar Tax imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries or one or more Sellers as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer Taxes_ "), and any penalties or interest with respect to such Transfer Taxes, shall be borne equally by Sellers (as Company Transaction Expenses) and by Buyer. The Seller Representative agrees to cooperate with Buyer and the Company in the filing of any Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying any information in its possession reasonably requested by Buyer and the Company that is reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns and promptly remitting to Buyer any invoices for such Transfer Taxes that are received by Sellers. 

  

 7. _Contest Provisions_. The Seller Representative and Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, shall promptly notify each other upon receipt by such party of written notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits, proceedings or similar events with respect to Taxes relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or to that portion of a Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date (any such inquiry, claim assessment, audit, proceeding or similar event, a " _Tax Matter_ "). If Sellers have any continuing indemnification obligations under _Section IX.B.1(iii)_, or under _Section IX.B.1(ii)_ for breach of any representations or warranties in _Section IV.H_ (Taxes), then the Seller Representative shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Matter (unless the amount of liability with respect to such Tax Matter could reasonably be expected to exceed 125% of the excess of (i) the amount remaining under the Cap over (ii) the amount which could reasonably be expected to be paid in satisfaction of any pending but unresolved claims for indemnification, in which event Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis and Buyer shall not resolve such Tax Matter without the Seller Representatives written consent). Whenever the Seller Representative controls the conduct and resolution of a Tax Matter, the Seller Representative shall keep Buyer informed of all developments on a timely basis; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any of the issues raised in such Tax Matter could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on Taxes of the Company or its Subsidiaries for a taxable period beginning (or the portion of a Straddle Period beginning) after the Closing Date, then the Seller Representative shall afford Buyer the opportunity to control jointly the conduct and resolution of the portion of such Tax Matter which could have an adverse impact on such Taxes in such period or portion thereof. If the Seller Representative has the right to control the conduct and resolution of a Tax Matter but elects in writing not to do so within 15 days of receiving notice of such Tax Matter, then Buyer shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax Matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that whenever Buyer has the right to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Matter pursuant to this sentence, that Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative informed of all developments on a timely basis and Buyer shall not resolve such Tax Matter in a manner that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on Sellers indemnification obligations under this Agreement without the Seller Representatives written consent. Each party shall bear its own costs for participating in any Tax Matter. 

  

 8. _Tax Treatment of Transaction_. Consistent with Situation 2 of Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432, the parties hereto agree to treat, for U.S. federal income Tax purposes, the transfer of interests by Sellers to Buyer as follows: (i) as to Sellers, as a transfer of interests by Sellers to Buyer; (ii) as to Buyer, as if the Company had distributed in liquidation of the Company to each Seller its respective pro rata share of the Companys assets and as if Buyer had purchased each Sellers respective pro rata share of the assets received from the Company. The parties hereto further agree that (A) the transfer of the interests shall result in a termination of the partnership for purposes of Section 708 of the Code and (B) the taxable year of the Company shall close as of the end of the day on the Closing Date.  

  

 9. _Allocation_. Buyer and Sellers hereby agree that the Purchase Price (together with all amounts treated as consideration for U.S. federal income tax purposes) shall be allocated among the assets acquired pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any similar provision of state, local or foreign law, as appropriate) and in accordance with the methodology set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto (the " _Allocation_ "). The Allocation shall be delivered by Buyer to Seller Representative within 150 days after the Closing Date for Seller Representatives approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall work in 

   ##### 

  

 

good faith to resolve any disputes relating to the Allocation. If Buyer and
the Seller Representative are unable to resolve any such dispute within 30
days of Seller Representatives receipt of the Allocation, such dispute shall
be resolved promptly by the Independent Auditor, the costs of which shall be
borne equally by Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. To
the extent required by any applicable Legal Requirement, the  Allocation
shall be revised to reflect any adjustment of the total consideration
payable by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer and Sellers shall prepare
and file all Tax Returns and other statements in a manner consistent with the
Allocation and shall not make any inconsistent statement or adjustment on any
Tax Returns or otherwise during the course of an audit, investigation or
other dispute with a Tax authority; provided, however, that nothing
contained herein shall prevent Buyer or Sellers from settling any proposed
deficiency or adjustment by any Tax authority based upon or arising out of
the Allocation, and neither Buyer nor Sellers shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Tax
authority challenging such Allocation. 

   

 10. _Section 338 Election_. Buyer shall not make and shall not permit the Company to make an election under Section 338(g) of the Code or any corresponding elections under state or local Tax law, with respect to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement. During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2011, Buyer shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to operate their business consistent with past practice and shall not undertake any restructurings outside of the ordinary course which have the effect of increasing earnings and profits (other than earnings and profits generated in the ordinary course of business). For the avoidance of doubt, provided that any such restructurings are properly treated as tax-free under Code Section 332, 351 or 368 and do not have the effect of increasing earnings and profits, the foregoing shall not prevent Buyer from engaging in such transactions. 

  

 11. None of Buyer, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall amend any Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle Period without the consent of the Seller Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. For the avoidance of doubt, if such amendment would give rise to adverse Tax consequences to any Seller, it shall not be considered unreasonable for the Seller Representative to withhold its consent. 

  

 D. WARN. 

  

 1. Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN without complying in all material respects with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN. 

  

 2. Buyer agrees that it shall not, nor shall it permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, at any time prior to 90 days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN without complying in all material respects with the notice requirements and all other provisions of WARN. 

  

 E. Further Assurances. Subject to the limitations set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, from time to time, as and when requested by any party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as the requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
