Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer, (i) an unaudited balance
sheet of the Company as of the Closing Time (but excluding any effect of the
consummation of the Contemplated Transactions) and (ii) its calculation in
reasonable detail of Cash, Indebtedness, and Net Working Capital that
is derived therefrom together with any supporting documentation and the
Purchase Price resulting therefrom (together, the " _Closing Statement_ ");
_provided_ that, in the event Buyer or the Company does not provide any papers
or documents reasonably requested by Seller or any of its representatives
within five Business Days of request therefor (or such shorter period as may
remain in such 60 day period), such 60 day period will be automatically
extended by one Business Day for each additional day required for Buyer or
the Company to reasonably respond to such request; and _provided_ , _further_
, that the Net Working Capital set forth in the Closing Statement shall
include amounts for each of the line items set forth on the Net Working
Capital Calculation Schedule. The Closing Statement will be prepared in a
manner consistent with the definitions of the terms Cash, Indebtedness and Net
Working Capital and the accounting principles and practices referred to
therein. The Closing Statement will entirely disregard (i) any and all effects
on the Company (including the assets and liabilities of the Company) as a
result of the Contemplated Transactions or of any financing or
refinancing arrangements entered into at any time by Buyer or any other
transaction entered into by Buyer in connection with the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions, and (ii) any of the plans, transactions, funding,
payments or changes which Buyer initiates or makes or causes to be initiated
or made at or after the Closing with respect to the Company or their business
or assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to
Buyer or any of its assets or liabilities. 

 



-4- (b) Buyer will, and, from and after the Closing will cause the Company to, (i)
provide Seller and its representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the books, records (including work papers, schedules,
memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and employees of
the Company for purposes of their preparation of the Closing Statement, and
(ii) reasonably cooperate with Seller and its representatives in connection
with such preparation, including providing on a timely basis all other
information necessary or useful in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement as is requested by Seller or its representatives. Buyer
shall have the right to dispute any or all of information set forth in the
Closing Statement by delivering to Seller a statement (a " _Dispute
Statement"_ ), which will identify in reasonable detail those items to which
Buyer objects (the " _Disputed Items_ "). If a Dispute Statement is not
delivered to Seller within 30 days after Buyers receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Closing Statement as prepared by Seller will be final and
binding. In the event a Dispute Statement is delivered by Buyer to Seller,
Seller and Buyer will negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items,
but if they do not reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery
of the Dispute Statement to Seller (" _Negotiation Failure_ "), Seller and
Buyer will submit any unresolved Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm within
ten Business Days of the Negotiation Failure. In the event the parties submit
any unresolved Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party will submit a
Closing Statement, in the case of Seller, or a Dispute Statement, in the case
of Buyer, (which in the case of each party may be a Closing Statement or
Dispute Statement that, with respect to the unresolved Disputed Items (but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is
different than the Closing Statement initially submitted to Buyer, or the
Dispute Statement delivered to Seller, as applicable) together with such
supporting documentation as it deems appropriate (collectively, the " _Final
Statements_ "), to the Accounting Firm within 30 days after the date on which
such unresolved Disputed Items were submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution. The Accounting Firm will resolve such dispute by choosing, in its
entirety, either the Dispute Statement submitted by Buyer (as revised
in accordance with the preceding sentence, if revised at all) or the Closing
Statement submitted by Seller (as revised in accordance with the preceding
sentence, if revised at all), and will make no other resolution of such
dispute (including by combining elements of the respective Final Statements
submitted by the parties or by reviewing matters which were not submitted to
the Accounting Firm for resolution). Seller and Buyer will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to
resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any event within 30 days
after the date on which the Accounting Firm receives the Final Statements
prepared by Seller and Buyer. The Final Statement selected by the Accounting
Firm will be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties. Each party will
bear its own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such
dispute by the Accounting Firm. The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm
will be paid by the party whose Final Statement is not chosen by the
Accounting Firm in its resolution of the dispute; provided, however, that if
the Accounting Firm is engaged but the Disputed Items are resolved between
Seller and Buyer before the Accounting Firm completes its work, Buyer and
Seller will each pay 50% of the costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm. As
used herein, (a) the " _Final Closing Statement_ " shall mean the Closing
Statement (i) as adjusted to reflect any changes mutually agreed to by the
parties, (ii) in the event reviewed by the Accounting Firm, as determined by
the final, binding and non-appealable decision of the Accounting Firm and
(iii) in the event a Dispute Statement is 

 



-5-  not timely delivered by Buyer, the Closing Statement originally delivered by
Seller pursuant to _Section 1.05(a)_, in each case, pursuant to this _Section
1.05_ and (b) the amount set forth on the line item "Accounts Receivable 
Unaffiliated Third Parties" in the Net Working Capital section of the Final
Closing Statement is referred to herein as the " _Final Accounts
Receivable Balance_ ". The Final Accounts Receivable Balance is subject to
adjustment in accordance with _Section 6.06_.

(c) Following the determination of the Final Closing Statement in accordance
with _Section 1.05(b)_, the Purchase Price shall be recalculated (as set
forth in _Section 1.02(a)_) using the final amounts of Cash, Indebtedness and
Net Working Capital set forth thereon (the " _Final Purchase Price_ ") in
lieu of the estimated figures used to determine the Closing Payment:

 

(i) if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Closing Payment, then,
within five Business Days after such determination, Buyer will pay to the
account specified by Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to such excess; and

 

(ii) if the Final Purchase Price is less than the Closing Payment, then,
within five Business Days after such determination, Seller will pay to the
account specified by Buyer, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
an amount equal to such difference.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, any payments made pursuant to the foregoing
shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 

Section 1.06. _Realized Accounts Receivable Post-Closing Payment Adjustment_.

 

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 30 days after the 9 month
anniversary of the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer a
statement (the " _Realized Accounts Receivable Statement_ "), in reasonable
detail, of the Final Accounts Receivable Balance that were actually collected
by the Company on or prior to the 9 month anniversary of the Closing Date
(the " _Realized Accounts Receivable_ "). The Realized Accounts Receivable
Statement will be prepared in a manner consistent with the Companys
accounting principles and practices regarding accounts receivable in effect
prior to the Closing. Buyer will, and (from and after the Closing) will cause
the Company to, (i) provide Seller and its representatives with full access
during normal business hours to the books, records (including work papers,
schedules, memoranda and other documents), supporting data, facilities and
employees of the Company for purposes of Sellers preparation of the Realized
Accounts Receivable Statement, and (ii) cooperate fully with Seller and its
representatives in connection with such preparation, including providing on a
timely basis all other information necessary in connection with the
preparation of the Realized Accounts Receivable Statement as is requested by
Seller or its representatives. Buyer shall have the right to dispute any or
all of information set forth in the Realized Accounts Receivable Statement by
delivering to Seller a statement (an " _AR Dispute Statement_ "), which will
identify in reasonable detail those items to which Buyer objects (the " _AR
Disputed Items_ "). If an AR Dispute Statement is not delivered to Seller
within 30 days after Buyers receipt of the Realized Accounts Receivable
Statement, the Realized Accounts Receivable Statement as prepared by Seller
will be final and binding. In the event an AR

 



-6-  Dispute Statement is delivered by Buyer to Seller, Buyer and Seller will
negotiate in good faith to resolve the AR Disputed Items, but if they do not
reach a final resolution within 30 days after the delivery of the AR Dispute
Statement to Seller (an " _AR Negotiation Failure_ "), Buyer and Seller will
submit any unresolved AR Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm within ten
Business Days of the AR Negotiation Failure. The Accounting Firm shall be
mutually engaged by Seller and Buyer and shall have the privileges, powers and
immunities of an arbitrator. In the event the parties submit any unresolved AR
Disputed Items to the Accounting Firm, each party will submit a Realized
Accounts Receivable Statement, in the case of Seller, or an AR Dispute
Statement, in the case of Buyer, (which in the case of each party may be a
Realized Accounts Receivable Statement or AR Dispute Statement, as applicable
that, with respect to the unresolved AR Disputed Items (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, with respect to any other items), is different than the
Realized Accounts Receivable Statement initially submitted to Buyer, or the AR
Dispute Statement delivered to Seller, as applicable) together with such
supporting documentation as it deems appropriate (collectively, the " _Final
AR Statements_ "), to the Accounting Firm within 30 days after the date on
which such unresolved AR Disputed Items were submitted to the Accounting Firm
for resolution. The Accounting Firm will resolve such dispute by choosing, in
its entirety, the Final AR Statement proposed by either Seller or Buyer, and
will make no other resolution of such dispute (including by combining
elements of the Final AR Statements submitted by both parties). Seller and
Buyer will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Accounting Firm to resolve such dispute as soon as practicable, but in any

expenses of the Accounting Firm will be paid by the party whose Final AR

Firm completes its work, Buyer and Seller will each pay 50% of the costs and
expenses of the Accounting Firm. As used herein, the Realized Accounts
Receivable Statement, as adjusted to reflect any changes agreed to by the
parties and the decision of the Accounting Firm, in each case, pursuant to
this  _Section 1.06_, is referred to herein as the " _Final Realized
Accounts Receivable Statement_ " and the Realized Accounts Receivable as set
forth therein is referred to herein as the " _Final Realized
Accounts Receivable_ ".

Statement:

 

(i) if the Final Realized Accounts Receivable is greater than the sum of (x)
the Final Accounts Receivable Balance plus (y) US$100,000 (such sum, the "
_AR Ceiling_ "), then, within five Business Days after such determination,
Buyer will pay to the account specified by Seller, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount equal to the excess of the Final
Realized Accounts Receivable over the AR Ceiling; and

(ii) if the amount equal to (x) the Final Accounts Receivable Balance minus
(y) US$100,000 (such amount, the " _AR Floor_ ") is greater than the Final
Realized Accounts Receivable, then, within five Business Days after such
determination, Seller will pay to the account specified by Buyer, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the excess of the
AR Floor over the Final Realized Accounts Receivable.

 



-7- (c) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) any payments made pursuant to the
foregoing shall be deemed to be adjustments to the Purchase Price; and (ii)
this Section 1.06 sets forth the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer with
respect to any alleged Damages associated with any representations and
warranties or covenants of Seller set forth in this Agreement related to the
Final Accounts Receivable Balance and the Realized Accounts Receivable.

DandO Indemnified Persons as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at
least six years from the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to directors liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as
favorable to the DandO Indemnified Persons as the Companys existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing
Date. Buyer will not, or will cause the Company to not, cancel or change such
insurance policies in any respect.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer agrees to ensure that (i) the DandO
Indemnifying Parties shall be the indemnitors of first resort under each of
the applicable indemnity obligations described herein with respect to the
DandO Indemnified Persons (i.e., their obligations to the DandO Indemnified
Persons shall be primary and any obligation of Seller (or any Affiliate
thereof other than the Company) to provide advancement or indemnification for
the same DandO Costs incurred by the DandO Indemnified Persons are secondary),
and (ii) if Seller (or any Affiliate thereof other than the Company) pays or
causes to be paid, for any reason, any amounts otherwise indemnifiable
hereunder or under any other indemnification agreement (whether pursuant to
contract or otherwise) with such DandO Indemnified Persons, then (x) Seller (or
its Affiliates, as the case may be) shall be fully subrogated to all rights of
such DandO Indemnified Persons with respect to such payment and (y) Buyer
shall, or shall cause the Company to, fully indemnify, reimburse and hold
harmless such Seller (or its Affiliate, as the case may be) for all such
payments actually made by it. Buyer further agrees to cause the Company to
unconditionally and irrevocably waive, relinquish and release, and to
otherwise not exercise any rights that the Company may now have or hereafter
acquire against Seller (or Affiliate thereof) or any DandO Indemnified
Person that arise from or relate to the existence, performance or enforcement
of any indemnification obligations of a DandO Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise, including, without limitation, any right of
subrogation (whether pursuant to contract or common law), reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution or indemnification, or to be held harmless, and any
right to participate in any claim or remedy of a DandO Indemnified Person
against Seller (or any Affiliate thereof) or another DandO Indemnified Person,
whether or not such claim, remedy or right arises in equity or under contract,
statute or common law.

 



-18- Section 6.06. _Buyer Covenants Regarding Company Accounts Receivable._

 

(a) Buyer shall cause the Company to continue to manage and collect its
accounts receivable in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, until such time as
100% of the accounts receivable of the Company as of the Closing (the "

Specified Accounts Receivable, or (ii) other changes in payment terms, in
particular the due date for payment of such Specified Accounts Receivable.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall and shall
cause the Company to use their respective best efforts (at the expense of

limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer shall (and shall cause the
Company to) engage outside counsel to assist in the collection of the Final
Accounts Receivable Balance which are unpaid more than 45 days following the
Closing Date and, in the event a portion of the Final Accounts Receivable
Balance represented by a franchisee of the Company remains outstanding as of
the date that is six (6) months following the Closing Date, to the extent
requested by Seller in writing, the Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary in order to cause such specified franchisees franchise agreement
with the Company to be terminated. If any franchisees (each, a " _Specified
Franchisee_ " and collectively, the " _Specified Franchisees_ ") franchise
agreement with the Company is not terminated as contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence, then for purposes of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, Section 1.06), as of any date of
determination, the Final Accounts Receivable Balance will be automatically
reduced by the outstanding accounts receivable that remains uncollected from
all Specified Franchisees.

Section 6.07.  _Covenants Regarding Removing Intercompany Arrangements_.
Buyer and the Company will cooperate, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by Seller, in connection with the removal and unwinding of all
intercompany arrangements existing prior to the Closing (collectively, the "
_Intercompany Arrangements_ "). Notwithstanding the generality of the
foregoing, Buyer shall and, following the Closing shall cause the Company to,
provide all documentation, support and other assistance requested by Seller
in order to facilitate funds transfers, journal entries, and related matters
associated with the removal and unwinding of all Intercompany Arrangements,
including the funds transfers and other transactions detailed on  _Section
2.07(b)_ of the Disclosure Schedule.

doubt, the time limits in which a Claim may be brought set forth in Section
7.01 shall in all cases apply to any claims for breach of, or otherwise
arising under any Specified Covenant (the " _Specified Covenant Claims_ ").

 

Section 7.03. _Limitations to Liability_.

 

(a) Neither Seller nor IP Company shall be liable for any damages, losses,
claims, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) ("
_Damages_ ") that are suffered by Buyer or its Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Company) (i) in respect of any individual Claim (or series of
related Claims) unless the amount of Damages with respect thereto exceeds
US$127,500, and (ii) unless the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to
all Claims exceeds $1,800,000 and then for the entire amount of such Damages

maximum liability for all Claims for breaches of Fundamental Warranties or for
breaches of any Specified Covenants shall not exceed US$63,750,000 in the

Section 7.04. _Calculation of Damages_.

 

(a) The amount of any Damages payable hereunder shall be net of (i) any
amounts recovered or recoverable by Buyer or its Affiliates under applicable
insurance policies or from any other Person alleged to be responsible
therefor, and (ii) any Tax benefit realized or expected to be realized by
Buyer or its Affiliates arising from the incurrence or payment of any such
Damages. In computing the amount of any such Tax benefit, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall be deemed to fully utilize, at the highest marginal tax rate
then in effect, all Tax items arising from the incurrence or payment of any
Damages. If Buyer or its Affiliates receives any amounts under applicable
insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be responsible for any
Damages, subsequent to a payment by Seller or IP Company, then such Person
shall promptly reimburse Seller or IP Company, as applicable, for any payment
made or expense incurred by such Person in connection with providing such
payment up to the amount received by such Person, net of any expenses incurred
by such Person in collecting such amount.

 



-21- (b) Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate in accordance with
applicable law any Damages claimed under this Agreement. If Buyer mitigates
any Damages in respect of which Seller or IP Company has already made payment
to Buyer, Buyer shall pay to Seller or IP Company, as applicable, an amount
equal to the extent of the value of the benefit of such mitigation (less
reasonable costs of mitigation) within ten Business Days after the benefit is
received. Without limiting the foregoing, prior to making any Claim, if Buyer
or the Company is entitled to recover (whether by payment, set-off, discount,
credit, relief, insurance or otherwise) from a third party any or all of such
Damages, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to first pursue and
enforce such claim for Damages against such third party (and for
the avoidance of doubt, any actual recovery of Buyer, less reasonable costs
incurred in obtaining the recovery, shall reduce or satisfy any Claim for such
Damages to such extent and, for the avoidance of doubt, the time limits set
forth in  _Section 7.01_ shall be deemed satisfied in respect of any such
Claim to the extent Buyer has made such claim for Damages against such third
party within the limits prescribed by _Section 7.01_).

 

(c) Neither Seller nor IP Company shall be liable for any Damages relating to
any matter to the extent that (A) there is included in the Financial
Statements a specific liability or reserve relating to such matter or (B)
Buyer or its Affiliates have otherwise been compensated for such matter
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the License Agreement or the Employee
Lease Agreement, as applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, neither Seller
nor IP Company shall be liable under this Agreement, the License Agreement,
the Employee Lease Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby more than once in respect of the same Damages.

(d) In no event shall any punitive, special, consequential or incidental
damages, loss of future revenue or income, business interruption, cost of
capital, loss of business reputation or opportunity, or diminution in value be
included in the determination as to whether any Damage has occurred or as to
the amount of any Damage incurred.

 

Section 7.05. _Additional Limitations_.

subject to the facts, matters and circumstances Disclosed (but only to the
extent that, for the avoidance of doubt, such facts, matters and circumstances
are fairly disclosed therein), (ii) it shall be deemed to have knowledge of
all such facts, matters and circumstances Disclosed, and (iii) Seller shall
have no liability in respect of any such facts, matters or circumstances
hereunder.

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that it is not aware of any facts,
circumstances, matters or other information as of the date hereof, which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to a Claim.

 

(c) Neither Seller nor IP Company shall be liable for any Claim to the extent
that (x) the alleged breach which is the subject of the Claim is capable of
remedy, and is remedied within 30 days of the date on which notice of such
Claim is received by Seller or IP Company; or (y) such Claim arises or is
increased (in which case for the incremental part only) directly
or indirectly as a result of:

 



-22- (i) the passing of, or a change in, a law, interpretation of the law
or administrative practice of any Governmental Body in any case occurring on
or after the date of this Agreement (but which has not been publicly published
by the relevant Governmental Body as of the date of this Agreement);

 

(ii) an increase in the Tax rates or an imposition of Tax in each case not in

published by the relevant Governmental Body as of the date of this Agreement);

accounting policy or a change in the application of any accounting policy or
estimation technique in the preparation of financial statements, or any
difference in any of the foregoing as between the Company prior to the date
of this Agreement and Buyer and the Company following Closing (but which has
not been publicly published by the relevant Governmental Body as of the date
of this Agreement);

 

(iv) any act, omission, transaction or arrangement (A) carried out in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or at the request of or with
the approval of Buyer before or at Closing or (B) by or on behalf of Buyer or
its Affiliates on or after Closing (including any breach by Buyer of any of
its obligations under this Agreement); or

 

(v) any reorganization or change in ownership of any member of Buyer or its
Affiliates (including the Company) on or after Closing.

Damages claimed, Buyers calculation thereof and any supporting documentation
therefor.

(b) Any Claim shall, if it has not been previously satisfied, settled or

claim that is the subject of a notice given by Buyer pursuant to _Section

shall ensure that Seller and its representatives are given reasonable access
to the relevant records, information and management of the Company to
investigate, defend or otherwise participate in, as applicable, any Third
Party Claim.

 



-23- (d) Buyer shall not (and shall ensure that the Company, Buyers Affiliates and

liability or make any agreement, settlement or compromise with any Person or
Governmental Body in relation to any Third Party Claim the defense of which
has not been assumed by Seller, without the prior consultation with Seller;
_provided_ that the prior written consent of Seller, which consent shall not

settlement or compromise that does not include a release from all liabilities
and obligations of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the underlying
claim or that imposes injunctive or other equitable relief.

Affiliates or the Company.

 

(g) Buyer shall take reasonable measures to mitigate any Damages suffered by
it or its relevant Affiliates or the Company in respect of a third party
claim.

(h) This _Section 7.06_ (except subsection (g) hereof) shall not apply to any
Third Party Claim for or related to Taxes which such claims shall be governed
by Section 8.07.

Section 7.07. _Acknowledgment by Buyer_. Buyer acknowledges that it has
conducted, to its satisfaction, and is relying on, its own independent
investigation, analysis and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Company and Assigned Assets in entering into the Contemplated Transactions.

indefinite period of time. Buyer has been afforded full and open access to the
books and records, facilities and personnel of the Company for purposes of

own expense to control the prosecution and defense of any Pre-Closing Tax

representations, warranties or covenants of any party hereto set forth or
contained in this Agreement or any Exhibit or Schedule hereto or any
certificate delivered hereunder.

 

Section 11.17. _Prior Company Counsel_. Each of Buyer and Seller agrees that
it and the Company will take all steps necessary to ensure that any privilege
attaching as a result of Ropes and Gray LLP, Sheppard, Mullin, Richter and Hampton
LLP or other counsel from time to time retained by the Company prior to the
Closing (collectively, " _Prior Company Counsel_ "), whether or not in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, will survive the Closing and
will remain in effect; _provided_ that from and after the Closing such
privilege will be controlled by Seller and not the Company. In addition, each
of Buyer and Seller waives, and agrees to cause the Company to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with (i) Prior Company Counsel
representing Seller after the Closing and (ii) the communication by
Prior Company Counsel to Seller, in any such representation, of any fact
known to Prior Company Counsel, including in connection with any negotiation,
arbitration, mediation, litigation or other proceeding in any way related to a
dispute with either Buyer or the Company following the

 



-39-  Closing, and the disclosure of any such fact in connection with any process
undertaken for the resolution of such dispute. Each of Buyer and Seller
acknowledges that it and the Company has had the opportunity to discuss and
obtain adequate information concerning the significance and material risks of,
and reasonable available alternatives to, the waivers, permissions and other
provisions of this Agreement, including the opportunity to consult with
counsel other than Prior Company Counsel. This _Section 11.17_ is for the
benefit of Seller and Prior Company Counsel, and Prior Company Counsel is an
intended third-party beneficiary of this _Section 11.17_. This  _Section
11.17_ will be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section 11.17_ may be
amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of Seller and
each Prior Company Counsel affected thereby.
