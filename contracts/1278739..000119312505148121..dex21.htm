ARTICLE III



EXCHANGE OF SECURITIES, CANCELLATION OF INTERESTS



SECTION 3.01 _Effect on Share Capital_. __ At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Amalgamation, and without any action on the part of Parent,
Amalgamation Sub, the Company or the holders of any of their respective
securities:



(a) _Share Capital of Amalgamation Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share in
the share capital of Amalgamation Sub shall be converted into and become one
fully paid and nonassessable share in the share capital, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Amalgamated Company.



(b) _Cancellation of Parent or Amalgamation Sub Owned Share Capital_. Each
authorized but unissued share of Company Common Share Capital and each share
of Company Common Share Capital owned by Parent, Amalgamation Sub, or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be cancelled and retired without any consideration
with respect thereto.



(c) _Company Common Share Capital_. Each share of the Company Common Share
Capital issued immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to
be cancelled in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_ and any Dissenting Shares)
will, by virtue of the Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into the right to receive $4.50 in cash per
share without any interest thereon (as adjusted in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Price Per Share_ "), subject to appropriate adjustment for
any share dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange with  



 

13  respect to the Company Common Share Capital occurring after the date hereof
and before the Effective Time. As of the Effective Time, all such shares of
the Company Common Share Capital shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
share in the Company Common Share Capital immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive the aggregate Price Per Share attributable to the number of shares of
the Company Common Share Capital so owned.



(d) _Options to Purchase Company Common Share Capital_. Except as may be
otherwise agreed in writing among Parent, the Company and any holder of any
Option, upon consummation of the Amalgamation, each Option outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then exercisable or
vested) shall be terminated and cancelled immediately prior to the Effective
Time as set forth in this _Section 3.01(d)_. Each Option that has an exercise
price per share of Company Common Share Capital less than the Price Per Share
shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive, as soon as is
practicable (but in no event later than five (5) Business Days) after the
Effective Time from the Amalgamated Company a cash payment in an aggregate
amount equal to the product of (A) the excess of the Price Per Share over the
option exercise price per share of such Option and (B) the number of shares
of Company Common Share Capital subject to such Option (collectively, the "
_Option Exercise Payments_ "). Each Option that has an exercise price per
share equal to or greater than the Price Per Share will automatically be
cancelled, without any consideration, as of the Effective Time. As of the
Effective Time, each of the Company Stock Plans and any other plan, program or
arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock or equity of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary shall be terminated and cancelled (without any liability on the
part of the Amalgamated Company other than as expressly set forth in this
_Section 3.01(d)_ ). From and after the Effective Time, other than as
expressly set forth in this _Section 3.01(d)_ , no holder of an Option shall
have any rights in respect thereof other than to receive payment (if any)
for his, her or its Options as set forth in this _Section 3.01(d)_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.01(d)_ , (i) the
Amalgamated Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder of Options under
this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code, the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) or under any other
provision of applicable Law and (ii) to the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable holder of Options.



(e) _Warrants to Purchase Company Common Share Capital_. Except as may be
otherwise agreed in writing among Parent, the Company and any holder of any
Warrant, upon consummation of the Amalgamation, each Warrant outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether or not then exercisable or
vested) shall entitle the holder thereof to the right to receive, upon
exercise and payment of any applicable Warrant consideration, from the
Amalgamated Company, a cash payment in an aggregate amount equal to the
product of (A) the Price Per Share and (B) the number of shares of Company
Common Share Capital subject to such Warrant (collectively, the " _Warrant
Exercise Payments_ "). From and after the Effective Time, other than as
expressly set forth in this Section 3.01(e), no holder of a Warrant shall have
any rights in respect thereof other than to receive payment (if any) for his,
her or its Warrants as set forth in this _Section 3.01(e)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Section 3.01(e)_ ,  



 

14  (i) the Amalgamated Company shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable to any holder of Warrants
under this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under the Code or under any other provision of applicable Law and
(ii) to the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the applicable holder of Warrants.



SECTION 3.02 _Surrender and Payment_.



(a) _Paying Agent_. No later than fifteen (15) days after the date hereof,
Parent shall designate a paying agent to act for the record holders of shares
of the Company Common Share Capital in connection with the Amalgamation,
which paying agent shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Paying Agent_ "). Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent will
deposit the aggregate Price Per Share payable in accordance with  _Section
3.01(c)_ in trust with the Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders of
shares in the Company Common Share Capital. The Paying Agent will be
authorized, at the request of Parent, to invest the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 3.02_ in (i) investment grade money
market instruments, (ii) direct obligations of the United States of America,
(iii) obligations for which the full faith and credit of the United States of
America is pledged to provide for the payment of principal and interest, (iv)
commercial paper rated the highest quality by both Moodys Investors Services,
Inc. and Standard and Poors Corporation or (v) certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, in each case having maturities not to exceed 30
days and as designated by Parent, with any interest earned thereon being
payable to Parent.



(b) _Surrender of Certificates_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
and the Amalgamated Company will cause the Paying Agent to mail and/or
otherwise distribute to each holder of Shares of the Company Common Share
Capital (other than holders of shares representing Dissenting Shares
or representing shares contemplated by _Section 3.01(b))_ , a notice and
letter of transmittal and instructions in standard form for use in effecting
the cancellation of all such interests and the surrender of all certificates
for such shares ("Certificates"), if any, held by each such record holder.



(c) _Payment Procedures_. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate,
together with such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed, the
Paying Agent shall pay to the holder of shares of Company Common Share
Capital evidenced by such Certificate the aggregate Price Per Share
attributable to the number of shares of the Company Common Share Capital
represented by such Certificate, and such Certificate will then be cancelled.
Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 3.02(c)_
, each Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares and
Certificates representing shares covered by _Section 3.01(b)_ ) will represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the aggregate Price Per Share
relating thereto. No interest shall accrue or be paid in respect of cash
payable upon the surrender of Certificates. At the Effective Time, all
Certificates issued immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be cancelled, and holders of Certificates shall cease to have
any rights as shareholders of the Company, except as provided herein or under
applicable Law. If any payment of cash in respect of cancelled shares of the
Company Common Share Capital is to be paid to a Person other than the
registered holder of the  



 

15  shares represented by the Certificate or Certificates surrendered in
exchange therefor, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Certificate or Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
shares or establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has
been paid or is not payable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement: (i) the Parent, Amalgamated Company and Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise
deliverable to any holder of Company Common Share Capital under this Agreement
such amounts as are required to be deducted or withheld therefrom
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, Section 116 of the
Income Tax Act (Canada) or under any other provision of applicable Law; and
(ii) to the extent that such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to
the applicable holder of Company Common Share Capital.



(d) _No Transfer_. After the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of
shares of the Company Common Share Capital recorded in the register of
members of the Amalgamated Company. If, after the Effective Time, valid
Certificates are presented to the Amalgamated Company or to the Paying Agent,
they will be cancelled and exchanged for the aggregate Price Per Share
attributable to the number of shares of the Company Common Share Capital
represented by such Certificates as provided in _Section 3.02(c)_.



(e) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Amalgamated Company, upon any such Person providing to the Amalgamated
Company a bond or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to Parent against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Paying Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the aggregate Price Per Share attributable to the number of shares
of the Company Common Share Capital represented by such Certificate due to
such Person as provided in _Section 3.02(c)_ of this Agreement.



(f) _Termination of Paying Agent Funding_. Any portion of funds held by the
Paying Agent which have not been delivered to holders of Certificates
pursuant to this _Article III_ within six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall promptly be paid or delivered, as appropriate, to Parent, and thereafter
holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with the exchange
procedures set forth in and contemplated by this _Section 3.02_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat and
similar Laws) for payment of the Price Per Share in accordance with this
Agreement. 



(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
3.02_ , none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Amalgamated Company nor any
other party hereto shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law.



 

16 SECTION 3.03 _Register of Members._ As of the Effective Time, the register of
members of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Share Capital thereafter
on such register of members.



SECTION 3.04 _Dissenting Shares._ Notwithstanding _Section 3.01(c)_ hereof,
shares of the Company Common Share Capital issued immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Amalgamation or consented thereto in writing and who has otherwise properly
perfected such holders right to appraisal for such shares in accordance with
the Companies Act (and who has neither effectively withdrawn nor lost his,
her or its right to such appraisal) (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be
converted into a right to receive the Price Per Share pursuant to _Section
3.01(c)_ , and shall be cancelled and converted into only such rights as are
granted by Section 106 of the Companies Act. If after the Effective Time such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its right
to appraisal, such Dissenting Shares shall be treated as if they had been
converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive the Per Share Price
as provided in _Section 3.01(c)_ , without interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of shares of Company Common Share Capital, and any withdrawals of
such demands and other instruments received by the Company, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Except as required by the Companies Act, the Company
shall not make any payments with respect to any demand by the holder(s) of
Dissenting Shares for appraisal of their Dissenting Shares or offer to
settle or settle or otherwise negotiate any such demands.



SECTION 3.05 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Amalgamated Company
with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and directors
of the Company are hereby fully authorized in the name of the Company or
otherwise to take, and will use all good faith efforts to take, all such
lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.

license, use, lease and otherwise hold its assets and properties and to carry
on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly qualified as
a foreign entity to do business, and is in good standing, in
each jurisdiction where the character of its properties, owned or leased, or
the nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where

aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(b) _Section 4.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true

is recognized under applicable Law) in good standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has the requisite power to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each Company Subsidiary is duly
qualified as a foreign entity to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of its properties, owned or leased, or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or membership interests (as
applicable) of each of the Companys Subsidiaries are validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and are owned by the Company or by a wholly owned
Company Subsidiary, free and clear of all Encumbrances, and there are no
proxies outstanding with respect to such shares or membership interests.
_Section 4.01 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true and
complete list of each Person (other than Company Subsidiaries) in which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary owns any equity, membership, limited
liability company, partnership or similar interest in, or any option, warrant,
convertible security or other interest convertible into or exercisable or
exchangeable for any such interest (each, a " _Minority Interest_ "), in each
case specifying the percentage interest held by the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary. 



SECTION 4.02 _Organizational Documents; Minutes_. True and complete copies of
the Organizational Documents of the Company and each material Company
Subsidiary, as in effect on the date hereof, have been furnished by the
Company to Parent prior to the date hereof. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is in violation of any of the provisions of its
Organizational Documents. The Company has made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of the minutes (or, in the case of minutes that have not
yet been finalized, drafts thereof (if available)) of all meetings and
written consents of the shareholders, Board of Directors and each committee of
the Board of Directors (or equivalent) of the Company, in each case since the
inception of the Company (other than portions of minutes of the Company
relating to this Agreement and the process followed by the Company that
resulted in this Agreement, the terms of other acquisition proposals and any
discussion of valuation of the Company or such acquisition proposals or of
the negotiation of this Agreement or such acquisition proposals set forth in
such minutes).



SECTION 4.03 _Capitalization_. The authorized share capital of the Company
consists of $1,000,000 divided into 100,000,000 shares of Company Common Share
Capital and, as of July 21, 2005: (i) 39,084,613 shares of the Company Common
Share Capital were outstanding, all of which were validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable, (ii) no shares of the Company Common Share Capital were
held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (iii) 3,821,141 shares of
the Company Common Share Capital were reserved for issuance pursuant to the

(iv) options to purchase 3,225,978 shares of the Company Common Share Capital
were outstanding under the Company Stock Plans (collectively, the " _Options_
") and (v) warrants to purchase 219,942 shares of the Company Common Share
Capital were outstanding (collectively, the " _Warrants_ ").  



 

18  As of the date of this Agreement and as of the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Plans are and will be the only Company stock option or other
equity incentive plans in effect and the Options are and will be the only
stock options issued under the Company Stock Plans. The Company has previously
made available to Parent complete and correct copies of each Company Stock
Plan and the agreement for each Option and Warrant, including, in each case,
all amendments thereto. Since December 31, 2004, no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities or equity interests of the Company have been issued or
reserved for issuance, except in connection with the exercise, exchange or
conversion of the outstanding Options or Warrants. _Section 4.03 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true and complete listing of all
outstanding Options and Warrants, setting forth the names of the holders of
such Options and Warrants, the number of Options and Warrants so held and the
exercise prices and vesting schedules of such Options and Warrants (as
applicable). Except as set forth in this _Section 4.03_ , there are not now,
and at the Effective Time there will not be, any shares of the Company Common
Share Capital or other equity securities of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary issued or outstanding or any options, warrants, rights or exchange,
conversion or other rights with respect to any equity securities of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such agreement or commitment.
There is no commitment of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to distribute
to holders of any class of its capital stock, any dividends, distributions,
evidences of indebtedness or assets, or agreements, arrangements or
commitments obligating the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue or sell
any share capital of the Company or any share capital, capital stock or other
like equity interest in any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in
_Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , there are no
outstanding contracts of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any share capital, capital stock or other equity
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in
_Section 4.03 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , there are no outstanding
contracts of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any share capital, capital stock or other equity securities
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company has obtained all
consents and made all amendments, if any, to the terms of the Company Stock
Plans, each Warrant and each Option agreement, as applicable, that are
necessary to give effect to the provisions of _Sections 3.01(d)_ and  _(e)_.
All outstanding shares of Company Common Share Capital are duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and have been issued in
accordance with applicable Securities Laws and none of such shares were issued
in violation of any pre-emptive rights, rights of first offer or first
refusal or similar rights. All Options and Warrants have been duly authorized
and have been issued in accordance with applicable Securities Laws.



SECTION 4.04 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. The Company has
the requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Company and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly authorized by the Board of Directors of the Company and
no other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, except for
any required approval of the Amalgamation by the Companys shareholders as set
forth in _Section 4.21_ of this Agreement. This Agreement has been declared
advisable by the Board of Directors of the Company. This Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company and constitutes a valid and  



 

19  binding obligation of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms.
Except as set forth in _Section 4.05_ , or as set forth on _Section 4.04 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary (and none of their respective property or assets) is subject to or
obligated under any provision of (i) its respective Organizational Documents,
(ii) any Contract, (iii) any Permit or (iv) any Law or Governmental Order,
which would be breached, violated or defaulted (with or without due notice or
lapse of time or both) or in respect of which a right of termination or
acceleration or a loss of a material benefit or any Encumbrance on any of its
assets would be created or suffered by or result from the Companys execution
and performance of this Agreement, except as to clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above where any such breach, violation, right of termination or acceleration,
or Encumbrances, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Subject to the
completeness and accuracy of Parents representations in this Agreement, the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby by the Company

(including Permits granted or issued by any Telecommunications Operating
Authority) necessary under applicable Law to conduct their respective business

the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (A) there is no pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened action by or before
any Governmental Entity to revoke, cancel, suspend, modify or refuse to renew
any Company Permit and (B) to the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has

Subsidiary has failed to obtain any material Permit required for the conduct
of its business or failed to conduct its business in accordance the Company
Permits, or (iv) the Company or any Company Subsidiary is in material default
under or in violation of any Company Permit and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, there are no existing facts or circumstances (including the execution
of this Agreement and the consummation of the Amalgamation and the other

in such a proceeding in either case or that would prevent any Company Permit
from being renewed on a routine basis or in the ordinary course.



(c) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are not required to be Canadian
owned and controlled pursuant to the Telecommunications Act (Canada) and the
Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control Regulations
promulgated pursuant thereto, and the Radiocommunications Act (Canada) and
the Radiocommunications Regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.



SECTION 4.06 _Compliance with Laws_. Except as set forth in _Section 4.06 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is being conducted in compliance with applicable Laws,
except for violations or possible violations which could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Except as disclosed in _Section 4.06 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , no investigation, review or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(including any Telecommunications Operating Authority) with respect to the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries or their respective businesses in relation
to any alleged violation of Law is pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity (including any
Telecommunications Operating Authority) indicated an intention to conduct the
same, except for such investigations which could not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is a party to any
Governmental Order or written agreement, consent agreement or memorandum
of understanding with any Governmental Entity, or is a party to any
commitment letter or similar undertaking with any Governmental Entity that
materially restricts the conduct of its business or which could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.



 

21 SECTION 4.07 _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.



(a) Except as described on _Section 4.07(a)(1) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , the Company has timely filed all forms, reports, statements and
documents required to be filed by it with the SEC and the NNM (collectively,
together with any amendments thereto and any such forms, reports, statements
and documents the Company may file or be required under applicable Law to file
subsequent to the date hereof until the Closing, including the Proxy
Statement, the " _Company Reports_ "). Each Company Report (as
finally amended) (i) complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the Exchange Act or Securities Act, as appropriate, and the rules and
regulations of the NNM, as the case may be and (ii) did not at the time it was
filed contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary is required under the
Exchange Act, by contract or otherwise to file any form, report, schedule,
statement or other document with the SEC, the NNM or any other stock exchange.
Except as set forth in _Section 4.07(a)(2) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , prior to the date hereof neither the SEC nor its staff has
challenged, or alleged or asserted any deficiency in, the accuracy or
appropriateness of any of the financial reporting or other disclosure of the
Company or any predecessor of the Company, except for those challenges,
allegations or assertions that have been resolved.



(b) The Company is in material compliance with the applicable requirements of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _SOX Act_ ") that are currently
effective as to the Company, and any and all applicable rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC thereunder that are currently effective as to the
Company, except where such noncompliance could not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures in accordance with Rule
13a-15 of the Exchange Act.



(c) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each case,
any notes thereto) contained in the Company Reports was prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP (subject, in the case of unaudited financial statements to
normal year end adjustments, which adjustments are not expected to
be material) applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods indicated
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto), each was derived from the
books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and each
presented fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof, and their
consolidated results of operations, shareholders equity and cash flows for
the respective periods indicated therein, except as otherwise noted therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments
which are not expected to be material).



(d) Except as and to the extent set forth or reserved against on the most
recent consolidated balance sheet of the Company as reported in the Company
Reports filed prior to the date hereof, including the notes thereto, as of the
date hereof the Company has no liabilities or obligations of any nature
(whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise) that would be required to
be reflected on a balance sheet or in notes thereto prepared in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, except for liabilities or obligations incurred in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice since December 31, 2004,
disclosed in the notes to such balance sheet, incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, that could  



 

22  not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise listed in _Section 4.07(d) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule_. Except as set forth in the Companys
financial statements contained in the most recent Company Report preceding the
date of this Agreement, the Company has no material Indebtedness. Since April
30, 2003, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has been a party to
any asset securitization transaction or "off-balance sheet arrangement" (as
defined in Item 303(c) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Exchange Act).
The Company Common Share Capital is the only class of equity securities of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary that is registered or required under
applicable Law to be registered under the Exchange Act.



(e) Subject to any reserves set forth in Companys financial statements
contained in the most recent Company Report preceding the date of this
Agreement, the accounts receivable shown thereon represent _bona fide_ claims
against debtors for sales and other charges, and are not subject to discount
except for normal cash and immaterial trade discounts. The amount carried for
doubtful accounts and allowances disclosed in Companys financial statements
contained in the most recent Company Report preceding the date of this
Agreement, was calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP and in a manner
consistent with prior periods. The Company has used commercially reasonable
efforts to collect all of its accounts receivable in accordance with
applicable credit terms.



SECTION 4.08 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since March 31, 2005

ownership interests in the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, (v)
other than in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice
and not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate or

or benefits or establishment of any bonus, insurance, severance,
deferred compensation, pension, retirement, profit sharing, share option

employee benefit plan, or any other increase in the compensation payable or
to become payable to employees, officers, consultants or directors of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, (vi) any issuance or sale of any share,
notes, bonds or other securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
(other than pursuant to the exercise of outstanding Options or Warrants), or

Law, any adoption of, any amendment to or any termination of any Company

SECTION 4.09 _Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters_.



(a) True and complete copies of all documents relating to Company Benefit
Plans including all plan documents, trusts or other funding agreements and
summary plan descriptions, as applicable, the most recent actuarial report and
financial report and the three (3) most recent annual reports on IRS Form 5500
have been made available to Parent and each Company Benefit Plan is listed in
_Section 4.09(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term " _Company Benefit Plan_ " consists of any plan, Contract,
policy, program or arrangement (regardless of whether written or unwritten,
funded or unfunded, or foreign or domestic) which is sponsored by the Company
or any Company Subsidiary, or to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary
makes contributions or which covers any current or former employee of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary in his or her capacity as a current or
former employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary has any obligation with respect to
any current or former employee, including each retirement pension, profit
sharing, savings, bonus, stock purchase, stock option, deferred compensation
severance, insurance, death, medical, hospital, dental, vision care, drug,
sick leave, disability, salary continuation, vacation or other compensation,
or employee benefit plan or arrangement.



 

24 (b) All Company Benefit Plans are valid and binding and in full force and
effect and there are no material defaults thereunder. Each Company Benefit
Plan complies currently, and has complied in the past, in all material
respects in form and operation, with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and other applicable Law, except for failures to comply which could not
be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Any "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA maintained by the Company, which is intended
to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has, to the extent
applicable, received a determination letter from the IRS evidencing such
qualification. Each Company Benefit Plan which is required under its terms or
by the _Pension Benefits Standards Act_ , 1985 (Canada), as amended, and the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada), as amended, or other applicable Law to be
registered, has been so registered and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there
are no facts or circumstances which could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the registered status of any such Company Benefit Plan. Except as
otherwise disclosed in _Section 4.09(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ ,
the Company does not provide any retiree health and life benefits under any
Company Benefit Plan (excluding (i) continuation coverage required under the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 and (ii) to the extent
not material, any written arrangements for post-termination of employment
medical or life coverage between the Company and any individual). There is no
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened litigation, actions or
proceedings, by any Governmental Entity or otherwise relating to any Company
Benefit Plan, except for pending or threatened litigation, actions or
proceedings that could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has engaged in, or failed to engage in, a transaction with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is reasonably likely to subject the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 or 4980B of the Code or Section 502(i), 502(c), 502(1) and
601 through 608 of ERISA or equivalent provisions under applicable Canadian
Law.



(c) Other than as set forth in _Section 4.09(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , no Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA (including
any "multiemployer plan" as defined in ERISA) has been sponsored or
contributed to by the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate
during the six (6) year period immediately preceding the date of this
Agreement. No Company Benefit Plan is a multi-employer plan under the Pension
Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (Canada), as amended, and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and any equivalent provincial legislation and
regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, " _Canadian Pension Law_ ").



(d) All contributions required to be made, and claims and premiums to be paid,
under the terms of any Company Benefit Plan or pursuant to applicable Law
have been timely made in full and proper form, or reserves therefor on the
Companys financial statements contained in the most recent Company Report
preceding the date of this Agreement have been established, which reserves
are adequate in all material respects.



(e) Except as set forth in _Section 4.09(e) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , no Company Benefit Plan has been partially terminated or has been
subject to events which could be declared to constitute a partial termination
as provided under applicable Law that  



 

25  could be reasonably expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect.



(f) Except as set forth in _Section 4.09(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , (i) neither the Company, any Company Subsidiary nor any ERISA
Affiliate contributes to any Company Benefit Plans which are "multiemployer
plans" (within the meaning of Sections 3(37) or 4001(a)(3) of ERISA)
under Subtitle E of ERISA or has any liability under any such plan that
remains unsatisfied or (ii) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
maintain a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section 4063 or 4064
of ERISA. Except as set forth in _Section 4.09(f) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , no Company Benefit Plan is: (i) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA, (ii) a "voluntary
employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9)
of the Code or other funding arrangement for the provision of welfare benefits
(such disclosure to include the amount of any such funding), or (iii) self-
insured by the Company, or a Company Subsidiary. No individual performing
services in the United States who has been classified by the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate as a non-employee (such as an
independent contractor, leased employee or consultant) shall have a claim
against the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate for
eligibility to participate in any Company Benefit Plans if such individual is
later reclassified as an employee of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate,
which could reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(g) Except as set forth on _Section 4.09(g) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , as of the date hereof, there are no collective bargaining or
other labor union agreements to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party or by which any of them is bound and neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is currently engaged in any labor negotiation. Except as
set forth on _Section 4.09(g) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,_ to the
Knowledge of the Company, since December 31, 2004, neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has encountered any labor union organizing activity, or had
any actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or
lockouts.



(h) Except as set forth in _Section 4.09(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , there are no unfair labor practice charges, grievances or
complaints pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company threatened, by or on
behalf of any employee or group of employees of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than those which could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(i) Other than as set forth in _Section 4.09(i) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , there are no complaints, charges, orders, prosecutions, or claims
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending, or to the Knowledge of
the Company, threatened, to be brought or filed, with any Governmental Entity
based on, arising out of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the
employment or termination of employment or any individual by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary other than those which could not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



 

26 (j) Other than as set forth in _Section 4.09(j) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , the Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance with all
Laws governing employment and labor matters, including all such Laws relating
to wages, hours, vacation, collective bargaining, discrimination, civil
rights, human rights, safety and health, workers compensation, language of
work, workplace safety, employment standards, labor relations and the
collection and payment of withholding and/or Social Security Taxes and similar
Taxes and other withholdings and remittances, other than those instances of
noncompliance which could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(k) Other than as set forth in _Section 4.09(k) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has effectuated
(i) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act or equivalent provisions
under the _Canada Labour Code_ or provincial employment legislation) affecting
any site of employment or one or more facilities or operating units within
any site of employment of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; or (ii) a
"mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or equivalent provisions under the
_Canada Labour Code_ or provincial employment legislation) affecting any site
of employment or facility of the Company or any Company Subsidiary; nor has
the Company or any Company Subsidiary been engaged in layoffs or employment
terminations sufficient in number to trigger application of any similar
foreign Law. The Company and the Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with
the terms and provisions of the United States Immigration Reform and Control
Act of 1986, as amended, and all related regulations promulgated thereunder,
other than instances of noncompliance, which could not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.



(l) Within 15 days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent
with a list of the position, status (including whether any such employee is
on a leave of absence and expected date of return if known), length of service
and compensation of each employee of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as of the date of this Agreement.



(m) Except as set forth in _Section 4.09(m) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule_ , neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or other
related agreements by the Company or any Company Subsidiary nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will: (i)
entitle any employee, consultant or director of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to any bonus, fee, distribution, remuneration, severance pay,
unemployment compensation or any other payment, or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting other than as required by law, or increase the amount of
compensation due any such employee, consultant or director. Except as set
forth in _Section 4.09(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ , neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement or other related agreements by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, will: (i) result in any payments under any of
the Company Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section 280G of
the Code; or (ii) cause any payments under any Company Benefit Plan to be
nondeductible under Section 162(m) of the Code.



 

27 SECTION 4.10 _Contracts_.



(a) A list of all Contracts in effect on the date hereof which are material to
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, including all amendments, and
supplements thereto and modifications thereof, is set forth on _Section 4.10
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ (all such Contracts, together with any

warranties, individually or collectively, would cause the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.02(a)_ or _Section 8.03(a)_ not to be satisfied; and (v)
any event or proposed action that has caused, or is reasonably likely to
cause, the failure of such party to comply with or satisfy in any material

respective obligations pursuant to this Agreement and to effect the
consummation of the Amalgamation.

permitted herein, the Company agrees that (i) it and its executive officers
and directors shall not, (ii) the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Subsidiaries executive officers and directors shall not and (iii) it shall
use reasonable best efforts to ensure that its and the Company Subsidiaries
Representatives shall not (A) directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
knowingly encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer (including any proposal or offer to the Companys shareholders) that
constitutes, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, (B) directly or indirectly, engage in any negotiations or
discussions concerning, or furnish to any Person any information with respect

authorize or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or
authorize or cause the Company to execute or enter into any letter of intent
or Contract with respect to any Company Competing Transaction (an "
_Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or its Board of Directors
from (i) taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to shareholders in connection with the making or
amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer) or from making any legally
required disclosure to shareholders with regard to an Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) prior to the approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the Companys shareholders in accordance with this Agreement, providing
access to its properties, books and records, or providing information or data,
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Companys Board of Directors
receives from the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (except for such changes specifically necessary
in order for the Company to be able to comply with its obligations under this
Agreement and it being understood that the Company may enter into a
confidentiality agreement without a standstill provision or with a standstill
provision less favorable to the Company if it waives or similarly modifies
the standstill provision in the Confidentiality Agreement), (iii) prior to the
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Companys
shareholders in accordance with this Agreement, engaging in any negotiations
or discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal, subject to compliance with clause (ii) above, if
applicable, or (iv) prior to the approval of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by the Companys shareholders in accordance with this
Agreement, (A) withdrawing, modifying or changing in any adverse manner its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or (B) recommending a
Company Competing Transaction pursuant to an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal; if and only to the extent that, in connection with any
of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with its legal counsel and financial advisors, that (x) in the
case of clause (iv) above only, the Company Competing Transaction contemplated
 



 

44  by the Acquisition Proposal would, if consummated, constitute a Superior
Proposal and (y) in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above only, such
actions are necessary to determine whether the Company Competing Transaction
contemplated by the Acquisition Proposal would be consummated and, if
consummated, would constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal after the date
hereof, which notice shall include the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof, and
thereafter promptly notify Parent of any material changes to such Acquisition
Proposal. In the event the Company receives an Acquisition Proposal that is
not received in violation of this _Section 6.05_ , and the Company believes
that such proposal is likely to constitute a Superior Proposal, the Company
may request such information from the offering party that is reasonably
required (after consultation with the Companys legal counsel and financial
advisors) in order to determine whether or not such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or would if accepted constitute, a Superior Proposal. The
Company shall promptly provide Parent with a copy of any non-ministerial
written or electronic information that it is providing to another Person
pursuant to this _Section 6.05(a)_ unless Parent has already been provided
such information. In addition, the Company shall notify Parent promptly (and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) if at any time the Companys Board
of Directors has determined that any such Acquisition Proposal constitutes,
or would if accepted constitute, a Superior Proposal.



(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing:



(x) If the Company or the Board of Directors takes any action described in the
foregoing clause (a)(iv) in response to a Superior Proposal, then on the same
day the Company takes such action the Company also shall (i) notify Parent in
writing that the Companys Board of Directors is prepared to take such action,
specifying the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal (including a
copy of a draft in substantially final form of any relevant Acquisition
Agreement), and stating that the Company has complied to date with the other
terms of this _Section 6.05_ and (ii) by telephone call to Topsy Mathew at
919-8200-87493 and e-mail to Topsy Mathew
at Topsy.Mathew@in.standardchartered.com, summarize the notice provided
pursuant to clause (i) above (it being agreed that the requirements of this
clause (ii) shall be met if a message is left via e-mail and at such telephone
number or if such telephone call is placed and after a reasonable period of
time is not answered either in person or electronically). The Company shall
not, however, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(h)_ to
implement such Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the third
Business Day following such notice.



(y) If the Companys Board of Directors elects to withdraw or modify its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement and the Amalgamation, other than
in response to a Superior Proposal, then simultaneously with taking such
action the Company shall so notify Parent.



(c) The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.



 

45 (d) Any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.05_ by
any Representative of the Company (including any Representative of a Company
Subsidiary), whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.05_ by
the Company. 



SECTION 6.06 _Control of Operations._ Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall exercise,
consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control
and supervision over its operations.



SECTION 6.07 _Further Action; Consents; Filings._



(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties
hereto shall (and shall cause its respective Subsidiaries, if any, to) use
commercially reasonable efforts to take, as promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the actions set forth in the following clauses (i) and
(vi) and use reasonable best efforts to take, as promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, the actions set forth in the following
clauses (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v): (i) take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper
or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate and make
effective the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) obtain from Governmental Entities any consents, Permits,
waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to be obtained or made
by Parent or the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) promptly as practicable make all necessary filings, and
thereafter make any other required or appropriate submissions, with respect to
this Agreement and the Amalgamation required under (A) the rules and
regulations of the NNM, (B) the Exchange Act and any other applicable Federal
or state securities Laws, (C) the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust
Laws, (D) the rules and regulations promulgated by any Telecommunications
Operating Authority, and (E) any other applicable Law, (iv) defend any
lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative,
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Amalgamation or the
other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (v) provide notice, in the manner
provided below, pursuant to Section 721 of the Defense Production Act of 1950,
as amended, and the regulations and rules promulgated thereunder (" _Exon-
Florio_ ") in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the " _Exon-Florio Notification_ "), and (vi) execute and deliver
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Amalgamation and the
other transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of,
this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the
Companys Board of Directors shall (1) take all action reasonably necessary
to ensure that no Bermuda takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is
or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Amalgamation or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (2) if any Bermuda takeover
statute or similar statute becomes applicable to this Agreement, the
Amalgamation or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take
all action reasonably necessary to ensure that the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated  



 

46  as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on this
Agreement, the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or the
Company to agree to, or proffer to, divest or hold separate any material
assets or any material portion of its business in response to a condition
imposed upon consummation of the Amalgamation by a Governmental Entity
pursuant to applicable Antitrust Laws. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each party hereto shall give the other party hereto the
opportunity to participate in the defense of any litigation against it and/or
its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
parties hereto shall cooperate and consult with each other in connection with
the making of all filings referenced in this Section 6.07(a) for any mutual
consents, Permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders (and not any
other such filings), including by providing copies of all such documents to
the nonfiling parties and their advisors prior to filing, and none of the
parties shall file any such document if any of the other parties shall have
reasonably objected to the filing of such document. The Company and Parent
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all
information required for any application or other filing to be made pursuant
to the rules and regulations of any applicable Law (including all information
required to be included in the Proxy Statement) in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company shall promptly and
fully respond to any reasonable requests by Parent for information held or
reasonably obtainable without significant unreimbursed expense by the Company
relevant to the Exon-Florio Notification, including information relating to
foreign national or foreign government ownership or control of the Company.
Parent shall control the preparation of the Exon-Florio Notification, which
shall be jointly submitted by both parties after coordinating with one
another as far in advance as is reasonably practicable with respect to the
Exon-Florio Notification. Such coordination shall include Parent providing the
Company with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the draft
Exon-Florio Notification prepared by Parent and providing the Company with
reasonable assurances prior to filing of the Exon-Florio Notification with
respect to any factual or legal matters contained therein as to which the
Company has raised reasonable and good faith objection in writing to Parent.
The Company and Parent shall each provide to the other party copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Exon-Florio Notification, keep the other party apprised
of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries or requests
received from any Governmental Entity in connection with the Exon-Florio
Notification and shall promptly provide any supplemental information
requested by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Exon-Florio
Notification.



(b) Each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in _Section
6.07(a)_ to obtain all requisite approvals and authorizations for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Laws, use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) keep the other
party informed of any communication received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any other U.S., or
foreign Governmental Entity and of any communication received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby;  



 

47  and (iii) permit the other party to review any communication given by it to,
and consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference with,
the FTC, the DOJ or any such other Governmental Entity or, in connection with
any proceeding by a private party, with any other person, and to the extent
permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable Governmental Entity or
other person, give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate
in such meetings and conferences.



(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in _Sections 6.07 (a) and (b)_ , if any objections are asserted
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, under any
Antitrust Law or if any Suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by
the FTC, the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private
party challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as
violative of any Antitrust Law or which would otherwise prohibit or materially
impair or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, each of Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or Suits so as
to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including in respect of such objections or Suits that if not resolved could
reasonably be expected to prohibit or materially impair or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including selling,
holding separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting its business in a
manner which would resolve such objections or suits or agreeing to sell, hold
separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its business in a manner which
would resolve such objections or Suits or permitting the sale, holding
separate or other disposition of, any of its assets or the assets of its
Subsidiaries or the conducting of its business in a manner which would resolve
such objections or Suits.



 

(d) Subject to the obligations under _Section 6.07(c)_ , in the event that any
administrative or judicial action or proceeding is instituted (or threatened
to be instituted) by a Governmental Entity or private party challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or any other agreement
contemplated hereby or thereby each of Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the
Company shall cooperate in all respects with each other and use its
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement,
nothing in this _Section 6.07_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ so long as such party has up to then
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this _Section
6.07_.



(f) Each of the Company and Parent will give (or will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to third Persons, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
consents from third Persons necessary, proper or advisable (as
reasonably determined by Parent in good faith with respect to notices or
consents to be delivered or obtained by the Company) to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



 

48 (g) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in  _Section 6.07(a)_ and except in connection with HSR Act and
other applicable Antitrust Law notification and reporting processes and the
Exon-Florio Notification process, as soon as reasonably practicable after
execution of this Agreement (but in any event in accordance with requirements
under applicable Law), the Company shall prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, the necessary applications, requests, notices and other
filings, and thereafter shall timely make all other filings and notifications
and timely seek all such Required Company Governmental Approvals for the
consummation of the Amalgamation. Parent and Amalgamation Sub shall cooperate
with the Company to the fullest extent reasonably possible to provide all
necessary information for the preparation of the applications, including those
portions of such applications, which are required to be completed by the
Parent and/or Amalgamation Sub. The Company and the Parent and the
Amalgamation Sub shall prosecute, or cause to be prosecuted, such filings
with all due diligence and otherwise use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain grants of approval as expeditiously as practicable. The parties shall
promptly inform each other of material communications from any Governmental
Entity concerning this Agreement, the consummation of the Amalgamation or any
Company Permit and, except in connection with filings and notifications
related to the HSR Act and other Antitrust Law notification and reporting
processes, compliance with which would prohibit such action, permit the other
party to review in advance any proposed written communication or information
submitted to any such Governmental Entity. Each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts not to cause or permit any of its officers,
directors, partners, or other affiliates to take any action which could
reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect the submission of
any required filings or notifications or grant of such approvals.



SECTION 6.08 _Employee Benefits_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Amalgamated Company and its
Subsidiaries will honor in accordance with their terms all existing
employment, severance, consulting and salary continuation agreements between
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries, and any current or former
executive officer or director of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries, subject to any modifications thereto agreed to by any such
officer or director with the Amalgamated Company.



(b) At the Effective Time and for a period of at least one (1) year after the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Amalgamated Company to provide employee
benefits to employees of the Company who are retained by Parent or the
Amalgamated Company (including retirement benefits, health benefits,
severance policies and general employment policies and procedures), which are
no less favorable in the aggregate to the employees than the benefits that are
available under the Company Benefit Plans; _provided, however_ , that (i)
nothing in this  _Section 6.08(b)_ shall prevent the Amalgamated Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from making any change required by applicable Law,
(ii) the foregoing shall not result in any duplication of benefits; and (iii)
nothing herein shall entitle an employee to be retained by Parent or the
Amalgamated Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the Effective Time and
for a period of at least one (1) year after the Effective Time, Parent will
cause the Amalgamated Company to provide severance benefits to employees of
the Company who are retained by Parent or the Amalgamated Company that are no
less favorable than the severance benefits such employees were entitled to
receive immediately prior to the Effective Time.



 

49 (c) To the extent permitted under applicable Law, each employee of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries shall be given credit for all service with the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries (or service credited by the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries) under all employee benefit plans, programs, policies and
arrangements maintained by Parent or the Amalgamated Company (other than
benefit accrual under any defined benefit plan) to the extent that such
service was recognized for such purpose under the applicable Company Benefit
Plan. With respect to any medical or dental benefit plan of Parent or the
Amalgamated Company in which employees of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause
the Amalgamated Company to waive or cause to be waived any waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements, except to
the extent such waiting periods, exclusions or requirements were applicable at
the Effective Time under the applicable Company Benefit Plans, and to provide
that any covered expenses incurred on or before the Effective Time by an
employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries (or by a covered
dependent of such an employee) shall be taken into account for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
provisions under any such medical or dental benefit plan after the Effective
Time.



SECTION 6.09 _Maintenance of Certain Trademark Registrations_. In the event
that (a) title to any material Registered Company Owned Intellectual Property
remains in the name of any predecessor of the Company and (b) an executive

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



SECTION 7.01 _Preparation of the Proxy Statement; the Company
Shareholders Meeting._



(a) _Company Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall, as soon as practicable
following execution of this Agreement and in accordance with this Agreement
and promptly following clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its shareholders (the "
_Company Shareholders Meeting_ "), to be held as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, for the purpose of considering and taking
action upon the adoption of this Agreement and the Amalgamation. The Company
shall: (i) through its Board of Directors, recommend to its shareholders that
they adopt this Agreement and the Company shall include such recommendation in
the Proxy Statement; and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit
from its shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
the Amalgamation and pursuant to the Proxy Statement and shall take all other
actions necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of shareholders
required by the Companies Act for the Company to effect the Amalgamation;
_provided, however_ ,  



 

50  that the Board of Directors of the Company may fail to make or may withdraw,
modify or change such recommendation and/or may fail to use such
commercially reasonable efforts and take other actions if the Board shall
have determined in accordance with _Section 6.05_ that a Company Competing
Transaction constitutes a Superior Proposal. The Proxy Statement shall provide
for a vote by Company shareholders on this Agreement and the Amalgamation.
The Company agrees that, except as permitted by _Section 6.05_ and subject to
the requirements of applicable Law, its obligations pursuant to this _Section
7.01(a)_ shall not be affected by the commencement, public disclosure or
communication to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Company Competing
Transaction.



(b) _Proxy Statement_. As soon as practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement
with respect to the Company Shareholders Meeting in a form reasonably
acceptable to Parent (the " _Proxy Statement_ "), and use its reasonable
efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC and mailed to the
Companys shareholders. Parent, Amalgamation Sub and the Company shall
cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy Statement. Subject
to _Section 7.01(a)_ , the Proxy Statement shall contain (A) statements of
the Companys Board of Directors that it has (i) determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the
Amalgamation, are fair to and in the best interests of the shareholders of the
Company, (ii) declared the Amalgamation and this Agreement to be advisable
and (iii) recommend that the shareholders of the Company vote in favor of the
approval of the Amalgamation and the adoption of this Agreement, which
recommendations shall not be withdrawn, amended or modified in a manner
adverse to Parent or the Amalgamation Sub (unless withdrawn, modified or
changed in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.05_ ) and (B) the written
opinion of the Companys Financial Advisor referred to in _Section 4.17_. The
Proxy Statement shall comply as to form and content in all material respects
with the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. Parent and its counsel
shall be given an opportunity to review and comment upon the Proxy Statement
and any amendment or supplement thereto prior to the filing thereof with the
SEC, and the Company shall consider any such comments in good faith. The
Company agrees to promptly provide to Parent and its counsel copies of any
comments which the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its
staff, any request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to
the Proxy Statement or for additional information and any other correspondence
between the Company or any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or
the Amalgamation. Parent and Amalgamation Sub will promptly supply to the
Company in writing, for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, all information
concerning Parent and Amalgamation Sub required by Law to be included in the
Proxy Statement. The Company, Parent and Amalgamation Sub agree to promptly
correct any information provided by any of them for use in the Proxy
Statement which shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause
such Proxy Statement as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the Companys shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. The Company agrees to use
reasonable efforts, after consultation with the other parties hereto, to
respond promptly to any comments or requests for any amendments or
supplements received from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement and any preliminary version or amendment thereof, filed by it. Each
of Parent and Amalgamation Sub agree to use reasonable efforts to promptly
provide the Company with any information necessary to respond to any such  



 

51  comments or requests received from the SEC or its staff. The Company, Parent
and Amalgamation Sub shall use reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders at the earliest
practicable time, in accordance with applicable Law.



(c) _Adjournment of the Shareholders Meeting._ Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 7.01_ , at any time prior to the Shareholders
Meeting, the Shareholders Meeting may be adjourned in response to an
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal which did not result from a breach of
_Section 6.05_ and which the Companys Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys independent outside legal counsel
and independent financial advisors of national reputation, reasonably may be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal for such time as the Companys
Board of Directors reasonably may require (not to exceed ten (10) Business
Days) for the purpose of evaluating and negotiating such Acquisition Proposal
(all in accordance with _Section 6.05_ ) and furnishing information to the
Companys shareholders with respect to such Acquisition Proposal.



(d) _Cancellation of the Shareholders Meeting_. The Company shall not be
required to hold the Shareholders Meeting if this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.01_ before the Shareholders Meeting is held.



SECTION 7.02 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance._



(a) From and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent will, and Parent will cause
the Amalgamated Company to, indemnify and hold harmless, and will provide
advancement of expenses to, each person who is or was a director or officer of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary at or at any time prior to the
Effective Time (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ "), to the same extent such persons are indemnified or
have the right to the advancement of expenses as of the date of this Agreement
by the Company or the applicable Company Subsidiary pursuant to its
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement and in
accordance with applicable Law; _provided_ that the Indemnified Party to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is
ultimately and finally determined that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
to indemnification, and (ii) Parent will cause the Amalgamated Company to
fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to
any indemnification agreements (including those set forth in the Companys or
a Company Subsidiarys Organizational Documents as in effect on the date of
this Agreement) between the Company and any of the Indemnified Parties in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any
provision of this _Section 7.02(a)_ , neither Parent nor the Amalgamated
Company shall, in connection with any one such action or proceeding or
separate but substantially similar actions or proceedings arising out of the
same general allegations, be liable for reasonable fees and expenses of more
than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any
time for all Indemnified Parties. Parent shall be entitled to participate in
the defense of any such action or proceeding, and counsel for the
Indemnified Party shall, to the extent consistent with their professional
responsibilities, reasonably cooperate with Parent and any counsel designated
by Parent.



(b) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and  



 

52  assets to any Person in a single transaction or a series of transactions,
then, and in each such case, Parent will make or cause to be made proper
provision so that the successors and assigns of the Amalgamated Company or
Parent assume the indemnification obligations described herein for the benefit
of the Indemnified Parties, as a condition to such merger, consolidation or
transfer becoming effective. 



(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.02_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties and
his or her heirs, assigns and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition
to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.



(d) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall
cause the Amalgamated Company to maintain, at no expense to the beneficiaries
in effect the current directors and officers liability insurance policies ("
_D andO Policies_"), with one or more financially reputable insurance companies
selected by Parent or the Amalgamated Company in its commercially reasonable
discretion, providing coverage that is comparable in all material respects to
the DandO Policies maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time; _provided, however_ , that: (i) in no event shall the Amalgamated
Company be required to expend for annual premiums for any such DandO Policies an
amount in excess of two hundred percent (200%) of the annual premium paid for
the DandO Policies maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement
(the " _Premium Amount_ "); and (ii) that if the Amalgamated Company is unable
to obtain the insurance required by this _Section 7.02(d)_ , it shall obtain
as much comparable insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to the
Premium Amount. In lieu of the foregoing, the Amalgamated Company may purchase
six-year "tail" coverage covering acts or omissions of such persons prior to
the Effective Time on substantially similar terms to the directors and
officers liability insurance policy maintained by the Company at the date of
this Agreement.



(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Closing Date) is made against any Indemnified director or officer, on or prior
to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this
_Section 7.02(e)_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.



(f) This covenant is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Directors and Officers and their
respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification provided for
herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an
Indemnified Director or Officer is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract
or otherwise. 



(g) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain in effect
at all times from the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,
directors and officers liability insurance comparable as to amount and other
material terms of coverage with such insurance as in effect on the date of
this Agreement.



SECTION 7.03 _Public Announcements._ The initial press release concerning the
Amalgamation to be released in connection with the execution and delivery of
this  



 

53  Agreement shall be a joint press release approved by Parent and the Company
and, thereafter, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements
with respect to this Agreement or the Amalgamation and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such public statement unless the parties shall
have consulted in advance with respect thereto, except to the extent required
by applicable Law or the requirements of the rules and regulations of the NNM,
in which case the issuing party shall use all reasonable efforts to consult
with the other party before issuing any such release or making any such
public statement.

(b) The Company agrees that if this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(d)_ , _9.01(e_ ), _9.01(f)_ (other than due
to a breach of a representation and warranty as provided therein) or _9.01(h)_
(as applicable), then the Company shall pay to Parent, or as directed by
Parent, a fee equal to four million five hundred thousand  



 

58  dollars ($4,500,000) (the " _Termination Fee_ "). The Termination Fee shall

to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , an
Acquisition Proposal by a third party has been made to the Company or its
Board of Directors, or has been made directly to the Companys shareholders
generally, or has been publicly disclosed or announced, and (ii) thereafter
this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 9.01(b)_ and
within nine (9) months after the termination the Company shall consummate or
enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal
(for purposes of this _Section 9.05_ only, all references to "20%" in the
definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to
"50%") with such third party, then upon consummation of such Acquisition
Proposal the Company shall pay to Parent, or as directed by Parent, a fee
equal to four million five hundred thousand dollars ($4,500,000); _provided,
however_ , that such fee shall not be due and payable if, at the time of such

Proposal with such third party, then upon consummation of such Acquisition

Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay to Parent any amount when
due under _Section 9.05(b)_ , _9.05(c)_ or _9.05(d)_ , the Company shall also
pay to Parent its fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit of other
