 **SECURITIES PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Securities Purchase Agreement (this " **Agreement** ") is made as of
February 3, 2014, among HOLLY HUNT ENTERPRISES, INC., an Illinois corporation
(the " **Company** "), HHM1 LLC, an Illinois limited liability company ("
**HHM1** "), the Persons listed as Sellers on the signature page hereof (each
a " **Seller** " and collectively, jointly and severally, the " **Sellers** ")
and KNOLL, INC., a Delaware corporation (" **Buyer** "). Capitalized terms
used herein are defined in the text; an index of such terms is attached to the
end of this Agreement.

 



 

 **PREAMBLE**

 



 

Sellers are the owners of all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Companys capital stock (the " **Company Shares** ") and the issued and
outstanding membership interests of HHM1 (the " **HHM1 Equity** ," and
together with the Company Shares, the " **Shares** "). Sellers desire to sell
the Shares to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase the Shares from Sellers,
all upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein. Therefore,
the parties agree as follows with the intent to be legally bound.

 



 

 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

Article I 
_PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES; SELLER REPRESENTATIVE_

 



 

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. On the Closing Date and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sellers will sell to Buyer, and Buyer
will purchase from Sellers, all of Sellers rights, title and interest in and
to the Shares, free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) (as
defined in _Section 2.19_ below).

 



 

1.02 _Purchase Price_. The purchase price for the Shares (the " **Purchase
Price** ") is One Hundred Nine Million Eighty Thousand U.S. Dollars
($109,080,000), which amount consists of (i) the Earn-Out Payments (as defined
and payable pursuant to _Section 1.03_ below) and (ii) Ninety-Five Million
U.S. Dollars ($95,000,000), minus the amounts paid as interest under the Table
Notes (excluding any amount paid as interest after an Event of Default (as
defined in the Table Notes)), minus the aggregate amount of all Company Debt,
minus the aggregate amount of all Company Expenses that remain unpaid as of
immediately prior to the Closing (the " **Unpaid Company Expenses** ") (such
amount as adjusted in accordance with this _Section 1.02_, _Section 1.04_,
_Section 1.05_ and _Section 8.07_, the " **Closing Consideration** "). The
Closing Consideration is payable by Buyer at the Closing as follows:

 



 

(a) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately
available funds (i) to the Persons entitled thereto, the Company Debt
designated to be paid on the "Company Debt Schedule" attached hereto as
_Schedule 1.02(a)(i)_ and (ii) to the Persons entitled thereto, the Unpaid
Company Expenses in accordance with the "Unpaid Company Expenses Schedule"
attached hereto as _Schedule 1.02(a)(ii)_. All payments of Company Debt and
Company Expenses hereunder (including for the avoidance of doubt all amounts
under the 2012 Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc. Long Term Incentive Plan satisfied
before Closing) shall be deemed to be paid directly by the Company immediately
prior to the Closing and otherwise shall be

      
 

 



 

deemed to have been paid by the Company immediately prior to the Closing for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the term " **Company Debt** " shall mean the following items of the
Company Parties that remain outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Closing: (A) all outstanding indebtedness for money borrowed from any Person
including all principal and overdrafts, whether or not reflected on the face
of the Company Parties balance sheets, together with all prepayment premiums,
breakage costs or penalties and other amounts with respect to such
indebtedness prepaid or becoming due as a result of this transaction, (B) all
obligations in respect of purchase money liens and capitalized leases
(calculated in accordance with GAAP), (C) indebtedness evidenced by any note,
bond, debenture, mortgage or other similar debt instrument or debt security,
(D) all commitments to assure a financial institution against loss (including
contingent reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit or
similar instruments), (E) any payment obligation under any existing interest
rate, foreign exchange, commodities or other swap, hedge or other financial
derivative instruments or agreement, (F) any off balance sheet financing,
including synthetic leases and project financing, (G) the amount of any
guarantees of indebtedness of the type described in clauses (A) through (G)
above of any other Person and (H) all interest expense accrued but unpaid on
or related to any such foregoing obligation; provided, however,
notwithstanding the foregoing, Company Debt shall not include the line of
credit or letters of credit issued by The Northern Trust Company designated to
not be terminated on the "Company Debt Schedule" attached hereto as _Schedule
1.02(a)(i)_ (the " **Northern LCs** "). Sellers shall cause the Company
Parties to obtain such releases, termination statements and other
documentation required by Buyer to confirm the termination of all
documentation relating to the Company Debt. In addition, at the Closing,
Sellers shall provide collateral to secure the Northern LCs; provided,
however, that Buyer shall or shall cause the Company to replace or otherwise
collateralize the Northern LCs on or prior to December 31, 2016 and, at such
time, shall cause all collateral provided by Sellers with respect thereto to
be released and paid to Sellers; and

 



 

(ii) the term " **Company Expenses** " means all fees and expenses incurred by
or on behalf of any Company Party, the Seller Representative or any Seller (to
the extent that any Company Party is responsible for such fees and expenses)
in connection with or otherwise relating to or incurred in preparation for the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the negotiation,
preparation or execution of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
and the performance or consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including without limitation: (A) any settlement of outstanding
equity compensation, stay bonus, transaction bonus, severance pay or other
amount payable to any employee, director, consultant or other service provider
of the Company Parties as a result of the transactions contemplated hereby;
(B) any fees of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, brokers, finders and
other professional advisors, to the extent not satisfied prior to the Closing
Date; (C) any fees and expenses associated with obtaining necessary or
appropriate waivers, consents or approvals of any Governmental Authority or
other third party on behalf of any Company Party other than as set forth in
_Section 9.03_ hereof; (D) any fees or expenses associated with obtaining the
release and termination of any Liens; and (E) the costs and expenses of the
DandO Tail Insurance as provided in _Section 7.06_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.09(b)_, Sellers hereby assume, or shall cause the
Company Parties, from the proceeds of the Purchase Price, to terminate and
satisfy in full, the obligations of the Company Parties listed on the
"Excluded Liabilities Schedule" attached hereto as Schedule 1.02(b)
(collectively, " **Excluded Liabilities** ");

 



 

(c) Buyer shall pay the balance of the Closing Consideration (after giving
effect to any payments or deductions pursuant to subsections (a) through (b)
above), as follows: (i) Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000) of
such balance shall be paid in immediately available funds to the Sellers set
forth on _Exhibit A_, pro rata based on their ownership of HHMI Equity, to
the account specified by each such Seller, and (ii) the remaining balance in
the form of promissory notes issued (individually, a " **Table Note** " and
collectively, the " **Table Notes** "), each in the form attached as _Exhibit
A_, payable by Buyer to each of the Sellers. Each Table Note shall have an
initial principal amount equal to such remaining balance of the Closing
Consideration multiplied by each Sellers HHE Pro Rata Share, as provided on
_Schedule 1.02(c)_ attached hereto, and shall be payable to the account
specified by each such Seller. In addition, Buyer shall pay the Earn-Out
Payment (if any) as provided in _Section 1.03_ below. As used in this
Agreement, a Sellers " **HHE Pro Rata Share** " means the percentage
specified as such Sellers HHE Pro Rata Share on _Schedule 1.02(c)_.

 



 

1.03 _Earn-Out_.

 



 

(a) _Earn-Out_. Subject to _Section 8.07_ and subject to Closing, Buyer shall
make earn-out payments to each Seller, in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares, in accordance with this Section (the " **Earn-Out Payment** "), if,
and only if, the business of the Company Parties (the " **Business** ")
achieves the Net Sales Target as set forth in this _Section 1.03_.

 



 

(b) _Net Sales Target_. For purposes of this Agreement, (i) the annual Net
Sales Target is set forth on _Schedule 1.03_ for each of calendar years 2014,
2015 and 2016 (the " **Net Sales Target** "), and (ii) " **Net Sales** " shall
be determined in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner consistent with that
used by the Company Parties in preparing their historical financial
statements, as specifically defined on _Schedule 1.03_ attached hereto. As
used herein, " **GAAP** " means United States generally accepted accounting
principles or any successor system of accounting principles (such as
international financial reporting standards) as set forth from time to time in
the opinions and pronouncements of the Accounting Principles Board and the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and statements and
pronouncements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (or agencies with
similar functions of comparable stature and authority within the accounting
profession), as in effect at the applicable time of determination and applied
on a consistent basis.

 



 

(c) _Earn-Out Payments_. No later than February 15 of each calendar year 2015,
2016 and 2017, Buyer will prepare and deliver to the Seller Representative (i)
the Companys audited financial statements for the preceding fiscal year
ending December 31 (each, an " **Annual Financial Statement** "), and (ii) a
written statement setting forth the Buyers good faith calculation of the Net
Sales for the preceding calendar year based upon the Annual Financial
Statement and _Schedule 1.03_ (items (i) and (ii) shall be collectively
referred to as the " **Annual Statements** "). In the event the Net Sales
Target is achieved for the applicable Earn-Out Period, the Earn-Out Payment
shall be equal to the amounts set forth on Schedule 1.03. The

 



      
 

 



 

amount of Net Sales for the applicable calendar year shall be referred to
herein as the " **Annual Revenue Amount** ," and the twelve (12) month period
constituting the applicable calendar year shall be referred to herein as the "
**Earn-Out Perio** d".

 



 

(d) _No Proration; Catch-Up Payments_. The Earn-Out Payments will not be
prorated for partial achievement of the Net Sales Target but catch-up payments
will be permitted in calendar years 2016 and 2017 based on cumulative results
of the then current and previous year(s) (an example of the catch up payment
is set forth on Schedule 1.03).

 



 

(e) _Earn-Out Payment as Purchase Price_. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the achievement by the Company Parties of the Net Sales Targets is a
material factor in determining the valuation of the Company Parties by Buyer.
The Earn-Out Payment payable to Sellers pursuant to this _Section 1.03_ does
not constitute payment for services, but rather constitutes part of the
Purchase Price payable by Buyer in connection with the purchase of the Shares
and shall be treated as such for all purposes, including for Tax purposes.

 



 

(f) _Earn-Out Payment Not Transferable and Not a Security_. No Seller may
sell, exchange, transfer or otherwise dispose of his right to receive any
portion of the Earn-Out Payment, other than by the laws of descent and
distribution or succession. The right of a Seller to a portion of the Earn-Out
Payment, if any, shall not be represented by a certificate or other
instrument, shall not represent an ownership interest in Buyer or either of
the Company Parties and shall not entitle the Seller to any rights as a holder
of any equity security of Buyer or the Company Parties.

 



 

(g) _Earn-out Period Access to Information_. Within thirty (30) days after the
end of each quarter during each of the calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016,
Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Seller Representative
the unaudited quarterly financial statements of the Company Parties. Within
thirty (30) days after the end of each month during each of the calendar years
2014, 2015 and 2016, Buyer shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
Seller Representative a reasonably detailed report setting forth a good faith
estimate of the Company Parties consolidated Net Sales for the month then
ended, along with the supporting calculations therefor. Further, once a year
during the calendar years 2015, 2016, and 2017, the Seller Representative or
its designee shall have the right, at the expense of Sellers and upon
reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours, to conduct an
audit of the Company Parties for purposes of reviewing and analyzing (A) the
Net Sales performance of the Company Parties and (B) Buyers compliance with
the provisions of this _Section 1.03_. During any such audit, Buyer shall
make available, or cause to be made available, to the Seller Representative or
its designee all books, records, personnel and other assets of the Company
Parties that the Seller Representative or its designee reasonably requests in
connection with such audit; provided, that such audit does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Company Parties.

 



 

(h) _Dispute Resolution_.

 



 

(i) After the Buyers delivery of each Annual Statement, the Seller
Representative will have a period of twenty (20) Business Days within which to
review such Annual Statement together with the calculations therein (the "
**Review Period** "). As part of such

 



      
 

 



 

review, the Seller Representative and its advisors will have reasonable access
during normal business hours to Buyers work papers and to the preparers of
each Annual Statement and to the books and records on which each Annual
Statement is based. If the Seller Representative disagrees with the Buyers
calculation of an Annual Revenue Amount, it shall notify Buyer in writing of
such disagreement prior to the expiration of the Review Period, setting forth
a specific description of the basis of the disagreement and a statement
reflecting the adjustments to the Annual Revenue Amount which the Seller
Representative believes should be made (the " **Sellers  Objections**"). If
the Seller Representative does not provide a notice of the Sellers Objections
within the Review Period, the Sellers and the Seller Representative shall be
deemed to have accepted the calculation of the Annual Revenue Amount delivered
by Buyer, which shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Business Day** " shall
mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or day when banks are closed or
authorized to be closed in the State of Illinois.

 



 

(ii) If the Seller Representative does provide timely notice of the Sellers
Objections, Buyer and the Seller Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts for a period of twenty (20) Business Days (or such longer
period as they may mutually agree in writing) to resolve any disagreements
with respect to the calculation of the Annual Revenue Amount (the " **Earn-Out
Resolution Period** "). If, at the conclusion of the Earn-Out Resolution
Period, any items remain in dispute, then each of Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall submit their written position with respect to such items
remaining in dispute to an independent accounting firm of recognized national
or regional standing mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Seller
Representative for resolution of the unresolved Sellers Objections or, if
they cannot agree, a Big Four accounting firm chosen by lot (after elimination
of those Big Four accounting firms having relationships with the parties) (the
" **Auditor** "). The Seller Representative and Buyer agree to execute, if
requested by the Auditor, a reasonable engagement letter and the fees and
expenses of the Auditor shall be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and
the Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage that the aggregate
amount not awarded to the Sellers or Buyer bears to the aggregate amount
actually contested by the Seller Representative (on behalf of the Sellers) or
Buyer, as applicable. Buyer and the Seller Representative will cooperate with
the Auditor during its engagement. The Auditor will consider only those items
and amounts disputed on the Sellers Objections that Buyer and the Seller
Representative have not been able to resolve. The Auditor shall resolve such
disagreements as promptly as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30)
Business Days after the date on which such dispute is referred to the Auditor,
and determine whether and to what extent (if any) Annual Revenue Amount (as
determined pursuant to the foregoing requirements) requires adjustment. Such
determination shall be set forth in a written statement delivered to the
Seller Representative and Buyer. In making its determination, the Auditor
shall (A) be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including
without limitation the terms of this _Section 1.03_, and (B) not assign any
value with respect to a disputed amount that is greater than the highest value
for such amount claimed by either Buyer or the Seller Representative or that
is less than the lowest value for such amount claimed by either Buyer or the
Seller Representative. The determination of the Auditor shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the Sellers, the Seller Representative and Buyer,
absent manifest error. Buyer, the Company Parties, the Seller Representative
and the Sellers shall make available to the Auditor all relevant work papers,
books and records relating to the calculations submitted and all other
information reasonably requested by the Auditor. Each of Buyer and the Seller
Representative will be afforded the opportunity to present to the Auditor

 



      
 

 



 

any materials and position papers related to the determination and to discuss
the determination with the Auditor; provided that no party shall initiate
discussions with the Auditor without the other party being given an
opportunity to participate in such discussion and each party shall provide the
other party with copies of any such materials provided to the Auditor.

 



 

(iii) Within five (5) Business Days after the final determination of the
Annual Revenue Amount and the Earn-Out Payment pursuant to this _Section
1.03(h)_, Buyer shall pay in cash to each Seller his, her or its Pro Rata
Share of the applicable Earn-Out Payment, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated by the Seller
Representative.

 



 

(i) _Operation of the Business Following the Closing_. During the Earn-Out
Periods, Buyer and the Company Parties shall (i) operate the Business in good
faith, and (ii) not take actions with respect to the operation of the Business
for the purpose of decreasing or otherwise frustrating the ability to achieve
the maximum the Earn-Out Payment.

 



 

(j) _Acceleration Event_. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 1.03_ to
the contrary, if (i) a Sale of the Business (as defined below) is consummated
prior to the payment in full of the Earn-Out Payments or (ii) Holly Hunts
employment with the Company is terminated without Cause (as defined in the
Employment Agreement) by the Buyer or any Company Party or (iii) Holly Hunt
resigns from the Company due to a material breach by the Buyer or any Company
Party of the Employment Agreement (each, an " **Acceleration Event** "), then
Buyer will pay, within five (5) Business Days of such Acceleration Event, in
cash, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, to each Seller his, her
or its Pro Rata Share of any remaining Earn-Out Payments which have not yet
been paid, including any catch-up payments subject to _Section 1.03(d)_
hereof. For purposes of this _Section 1.03_, " **Sale of the Business** "
means any transaction or series of related transactions (whether structured as
a stock sale, merger, consolidation, reorganization, asset sale, joint
venture, issuance of equity securities or otherwise) after the date of this
Agreement that results in the sale, transfer or issuance (as applicable) to an
unaffiliated third party or group of third parties acting together of (x) all
or substantially all of the assets of the Business or the Buyer or (y) the
beneficial ownership of a majority of the issued and outstanding equity
interests of the Buyer or any of the Company Parties.

 



 

1.04 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) Not more than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
Representative will, in good faith, prepare, or cause to be prepared, a
statement which shall set forth a reasonably itemized calculation of the
estimated Working Capital of the Company Parties expected as of the opening of
business on the Closing Date based on the Company Parties then available
financial information, based on GAAP applied in a manner consistent with that
used by the Company Parties in preparing their historical financial
statements. The amount of Working Capital as estimated by the Sellers is
Twelve Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars ($12,250,000), which
amount is hereinafter referred to as the " **Estimated Working Capital**." At
the Closing, the Closing Consideration portion of the Purchase Price payable
at Closing will be adjusted on a dollar-for-dollar basis as follows: if
Estimated Working Capital exceeds Twelve Million Two Hundred Fifty Thousand
U.S. Dollars ($12,250,000) _plus_ Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S. Dollars
($250,000) (the " **Maximum Working Capital Target** "), then the

 



       
 

 



 

Closing Consideration will be increased by the amount of such excess; if
Estimated Working Capital is less than Twelve Million Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand U.S. Dollars ($12,250,000) _minus_ Two Hundred Fifty Thousand U.S.
Dollars ($250,000) (the " **Minimum Working Capital Target** "), then the
Closing Consideration will be decreased by the amount of such deficiency. As
used herein, " **Working Capital** " means (a) the current assets (but
excluding cash, cash equivalents and the Excluded Assets) specifically listed
on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto, _minus_ (b) the current liabilities (but
excluding the Company Debt, Company Expenses and income tax liabilities)
specifically listed on _Exhibit B_ attached hereto. By way of example,
_Exhibit B_ sets forth a balance sheet of the Company Parties as of the
Current Financial Statement Date (the " **Current Balance Sheet** ") and a
calculation of Working Capital as of such date as calculated therefrom.

 



 

(b) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative a consolidated balance sheet of the
Company as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (as the same may be
adjusted in accordance with this subsection, the " **Closing Balance Sheet**
"), which balance sheet will be prepared in a manner consistent with that used
in preparing the Current Balance Sheet, together with its calculation of
Working Capital as of the opening of business on the Closing Date (as the same
may be adjusted in accordance with this subsection, " **Closing Working
Capital** "). The Seller Representative will have twenty (20) Business Days
after receiving Closing Balance Sheet and calculation of Closing Working
Capital from Buyer to review the same and Buyers calculation of Closing
Working Capital, and the process and procedures set forth in clauses (i) and
(ii) of _Section 1.03(h)_ shall apply to such review process and the
resolution of any objection of Seller Representative to the Buyers
calculation of Closing Working Capital.

 



 

(c) All payments under this subsection will be made within thirty (30) days
after Closing Working Capital has been finally determined. All payments under
this subsection to the Sellers will be made by Buyer via wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the
Seller Representative.

 



 

(d) If Closing Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.04_, is:

 



 

(i) not more than the Maximum Working Capital Target or less than the Minimum
Working Capital Target, and:

 



 

(1) the Estimated Working Capital was not more than the Maximum Working
Capital Target or less than the Minimum Working Capital Target, no adjustment
to the Purchase Price will be made pursuant to this _Section 1.04(d)_;

 



 

(2) the Estimated Working Capital was more than the Maximum Working Capital
Target, then Sellers shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Estimated
Closing Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Working Capital Target; or

 



 

(3) the Estimated Working Capital was less than the Minimum Working Capital
Target, then Buyer shall pay to each Seller his, her or its Pro Rata Share of
the

 



      
 

 



 

amount by which the Minimum Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated
Closing Working Capital;

 



 

(ii) more than the Maximum Working Capital Target, and:

 



 

(1) the Estimated Working Capital was not more than the Maximum Working
Capital Target or less than the Minimum Working Capital Target, then Buyer
shall pay to each Seller his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the amount by which
Closing Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Working Capital Target;

 



 

(2) the Estimated Working Capital was less than the Minimum Working Capital
Target, Buyer shall pay to each Seller his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the
sum of: (A) the amount by which the Closing Working Capital exceeds the
Maximum Working Capital Target; and (B) the amount by which the Minimum
Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital;

 



 

(3) the Estimated Working Capital was more than the Maximum Working Capital
Target but less than the Closing Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to each
Seller his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the amount by which Closing Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital; or

 



 

(4) the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital, then
Seller shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Estimated Closing Working
Capital exceeds the Closing Working Capital;

 



 

(iii) less than the Minimum Working Capital Target, and

 



 

(1) the Estimated Working Capital was not more than the Maximum Working
Capital Target or less than the Minimum Working Capital Target, then Sellers
shall pay to Buyer the amount by which the Minimum Working Capital Target
exceeds Closing Working Capital;

 



 

(2) the Estimated Working Capital was less than the Minimum Working Capital
Target and is less than the Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall pay to each
Seller his, her or its Pro Rata Share of the amount by which Closing Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital;

 



 

(3) the Estimated Working Capital was less than the Minimum Working Capital
Target but is more than the Closing Working Capital, then Sellers shall pay to
Buyer the amount by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds Closing
Working Capital; or

 



 

(4) the Estimated Working Capital was more than the Maximum Working Capital
Target, Sellers shall pay to Buyer the sum of: (A) the amount by which the
Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Maximum Working Capital Target; and (B)
the amount by which the Minimum Working Capital Target exceeds the Closing
Working Capital.

 



      
 

 



 

1.05 _Cash and Deposit Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) As used herein, " **Closing Date Cash** " means the cash and cash
equivalents of the Company Parties as of the Closing (which shall not include
any portion of the Purchase Price paid by Buyer to the Company Parties at the
direction of Sellers), calculated (i) excluding issued but uncleared checks
and drafts of the Company Parties, and (ii) including the amount of any checks
and drafts deposited for the account of a Company Party but not yet cleared
(as used herein, "drafts" includes both written and electronic fund transfer
orders). Not more than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Seller Representative will, in good faith, prepare, or cause to be prepared, a
statement which shall set forth a reasonably itemized calculation of the
estimated Closing Date Cash of the Company Parties expected as of the opening
of business on the Closing Date based on GAAP applied in a manner consistent
with that used by the Company Parties in preparing their historical financial
statements. The amount of Closing Date Cash as estimated is hereinafter
referred to as " **Estimated Closing Date Cash**."

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Closing Consideration portion of the Purchase Price
payable at Closing will be adjusted on a dollar-for-dollar basis as follows:
if Estimated Closing Date Cash exceeds Three Million Five Hundred Thousand
U.S. Dollars ($3,500,000) (the " **Deposit Cash Requirement** "), then the
Closing Consideration will be increased by the amount of such excess; if
Estimated Closing Date Cash is less than the amount of the Deposit Cash
Requirement, then the Closing Consideration will be decreased by the amount of
such deficiency.

 



 

(c) Within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer will prepare and
deliver to the Seller Representative its calculation of Closing Date Cash as
of the opening of business on the Closing Date (as the same may be adjusted in
accordance with this subsection, " **Final Closing Date Cash** "). The Seller
Representative will have twenty (20) Business Days after receiving Buyers
calculation of the Final Closing Date Cash to review the Buyers calculation
of Final Closing Date Cash and raise any objections thereto, and the process
and procedures set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of _Section 1.03(h)_ shall
apply to such review process and the resolution of any objection of the Seller
Representative to Buyers calculation of Final Closing Date Cash.

 



 

(d) If Final Closing Date Cash, as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.05_, is (i) less than the Estimated Closing Date Cash, then
Sellers will pay to Buyer the amount of such deficiency or (ii) greater than
the Estimated Closing Date Cash, then Buyer will pay to Sellers the amount of
such excess. All payments under this subsection will be made within thirty
(30) days after Final Closing Date Cash has been finally determined. All
payments under this subsection to the Sellers will be made by Buyer via wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by the Seller Representative.

 



 

1.06 _Seller Representative_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date, each Seller, for itself or himself and
for its or his successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes
and appoints Holly Hunt as such Sellers agent and attorney-in-fact as Seller
Representative, with full power of substitution to act for and on behalf of
such Seller with respect to any claim or matter arising on

 



      
 

 



 

or after the Closing Date under the Transaction Documents (the " **Seller
Representative** "), and Holly Hunt hereby accepts such appointment. Each
Seller acknowledges that the appointment of Holly Hunt as the Seller
Representative is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked. All
decisions, actions, consents and instructions by the Seller Representative
shall be binding upon all of the Sellers, and no Seller shall have the right
to object to, dissent from, protest or otherwise contest the same. Buyer shall
be entitled to rely on any decision, action, consent, notice or instruction of
the Seller Representative as being the decision, action, consent or
instruction of the Sellers, and Buyer is hereby relieved from any liability to
any Person for acts done by them in accordance with any such decision, act,
consent or instruction. Immediately upon the approval of this Agreement by the
requisite vote or written consent of the Sellers, the Sellers shall jointly
and severally release, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates,
successors and assigns, from and against any and all losses, liabilities,
claims, actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees
and disbursements, arising out of and in connection with Seller
Representatives exercise of its authority pursuant to this _Section 1.06_.

 



 

(b) In furtherance of the appointment of the Seller Representative, each
Seller, fully and without restriction: (i) agrees to be bound by all notices
given and received and agreements and determinations made by and documents
executed and delivered by the Seller Representative under the Transaction
Documents; and (ii) authorizes the Seller Representative to (A) deliver to
Buyer all certificates and documents to be delivered to Buyer by Sellers
pursuant to the Transaction Documents, together with any certificates and
documents executed by Sellers and deposited with the Seller Representative for
such purpose, (B) dispute or refrain from disputing any claim made by Buyer
under the Transaction Documents and receive from Buyer service of process, (C)
negotiate and compromise any dispute which may arise under the Transaction
Documents and, if necessary, amend the Transaction Documents in order to give
effect to such compromise, (D) pay any amounts due Buyer from Sellers under
the Transaction Documents, (E) exercise or refrain from exercising any
remedies available to Sellers under the Transaction Documents, (F) sign any
releases or other documents with respect to any such dispute or remedy, (G)
waive any condition contained in the Transaction Documents, (H) give such
notices and instructions and do or refrain from doing such other things as the
Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, deems necessary or appropriate
to carry out the provisions of the Transaction Documents, (I) receive all
amounts payable by Buyer to Sellers under the Transaction Documents on behalf
of Sellers and, subject to the Seller Representatives other responsibilities
under this subsection, pay to each Seller such Sellers Pro Rata Share of such
amounts (unless otherwise provided in this Agreement), (J) pay out of funds
coming into the hands of the Seller Representative from Buyer all fees and
expenses of Sellers (and of the Seller Representative acting in such capacity)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, including without limitation the fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers and other professional advisors retained by or
on behalf of Sellers in connection with such transactions, (K) retain such
counsel, accountants and other professional advisors as the Seller
Representative reasonably deems necessary to assist it in the performance of
its duties hereunder and pay the fees, costs and expenses thereof out of the
funds coming into the hands of the Seller Representative, (L) retain out of
funds coming into the hands of the Seller Representative from or on behalf of
Buyer such amounts as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, deems
appropriate to be held as reserves for expected or potential future expenses
or liabilities of Sellers hereunder, and (M) take such actions with respect to
matters relating to Taxes that are contemplated by this Agreement. Except for
any

 



      
 

 



 

obligations for which Sellers are severally, but not jointly, liable, payments
made by the Seller Representative under this subsection will be considered to
be paid by all Sellers in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares. As
used in this Agreement, a Sellers " **Pro Rata Share** " means the percentage
specified as such Sellers Pro Rata Share on _Schedule 2.05_. No bond shall be
required of the Seller Representative, and the Seller Representative shall not
receive any compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or
from the Seller Representative after the Closing in connection with any
disputes or claims under Article VIII shall constitute notice to or from the
Sellers.

 



 

(c) If the Seller Representative resigns, ceases to be a legal entity (if
applicable), dies or becomes incapacitated, his, her or its successor will,
upon written notice to Buyer, be appointed within fifteen (15) days of such
event by Sellers owning a majority of the Shares immediately prior to the
Closing. The decisions and actions of any successor Seller Representative will
be, for all purposes, those of the Seller Representative as if originally
named herein. The death or incapacity of any Seller will not terminate the
authority and agency of the Seller Representative. Any successor Seller
Representative will provide Buyer with prompt written notice of its or his
appointment.

 



 

(d) Buyer will be entitled to rely exclusively on the Seller Representatives
authority for all purposes hereunder, including without limitation upon any
communication given or other action taken by the Seller Representative and
will not be liable to Sellers or any other Person for any action taken or not
taken in reliance upon the Seller Representative. Buyer will not be obligated
to inquire as to the authority of the Seller Representative with respect to
the taking of any action that the Seller Representative takes on behalf of
Sellers. Payment of the Purchase Price to the Seller Representative, or any
other amount due to Sellers hereunder, shall constitute payment to each Seller
by Buyer. Buyer shall have no obligation to distribute, or liability with
respect to the distribution of, the Purchase Price or any other payment, other
than to the Seller Representative, and shall have no liability for the
allocation of the Purchase Price or any other payment by the Seller
Representative among Sellers.

 



 

(e) The Seller Representative shall not be liable to the Sellers for actions
taken pursuant to this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, except to the
extent such actions shall have been determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have constituted willful misconduct or fraud. Except in cases
where a court of competent jurisdiction has made such a finding, the Sellers
shall jointly and severally release, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, claims,
actions, damages and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and
disbursements, arising out of and in connection with its activities as Seller
Representative under this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or otherwise.

 



 

1.07 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. Sellers and Buyer agree to join in making
elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any corresponding or
similar provision of state and local Governmental Rules with respect to
treating the purchase and sale of the Company Shares as an asset sale for Tax
purposes, and Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in the preparation and filing
of any IRS Forms 8023 and any other Tax forms or filings necessary to effect
such elections based on the Allocation Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit
C_ (the " **Allocation Schedule** "); provided that, subject to the terms of
this _Section 1.07_, the preparation and timely

 



      
 

 



 

filing of the IRS Form 8023 any other such Tax forms shall be the
responsibility of Buyer. No party shall take any action (i) inconsistent with
the treatment of these transactions as a "qualified stock purchase" within the
meaning of Section 338(d)(3) of the Code or (ii) which would otherwise make
elections under Section 338(h)(10) unavailable. Sellers and Buyer shall, in no
event later than five (5) days prior to the due date for filing IRS Form 8023
(Elections Under Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock
Purchases), exchange completed and executed copies of IRS Form 8023, required
schedules thereto, and any similar state and local forms requested by Buyer to
be filed. All such forms shall be drafted by Buyer and submitted to Sellers
for their review and approval, which shall not withheld or delayed so long as
such forms are in conformance with the Code and applicable Governmental Rules.
The Seller Representative and Buyer shall be responsible for revising the
Allocation Schedule upon the occurrence of any events requiring an adjustment
thereto under the Code, and such Allocation Schedule shall be so revised after
the final determination of Closing Working Capital and Final Closing Date Cash
solely to the extent necessary to reflect any difference between such amounts
and the related line items in the Allocation Schedule (along with any
resultant upward or downward adjustment to Goodwill). Except as may be
required pursuant to a final "determination" under Section 1313 of the Code,
none of the parties shall (i) take any Tax position inconsistent with the
allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule as finally determined (and
each of the parties shall reflect such allocation where relevant in all Tax
filings) or (ii) take, or fail to take, any action to the extent such action
or failure to act, as the case may be, is inconsistent with or would otherwise
prejudice any Section 338(h)(10) election.

 



 

Article II 
_REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY_

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure schedules attached hereto (it being understood that (x) each
disclosure schedule shall qualify the specifically identified sections or
subsections hereof to which such disclosure schedule relates (and shall not in

constituting, representations, warranties or covenants of the Company, HHM1 or
any Seller) and any other section or subsection hereof to the extent it is
readily apparent on its face that such disclosure is applicable to such other
sections and subsections (notwithstanding the omission of a reference or
cross-reference thereto) and (y) the mere inclusion of an item in the
disclosure schedule as an exception to a representation and warranty shall not
be deemed an admission or representation that such item represents a material
fact, event or circumstance or an admission of any liability or obligation to
any Person or that such item has or would reasonable be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect), the Company, HHM1 and the Sellers, jointly and
severally, each represents and warrants to Buyer as follows, as of the date

duly organized, validly existing and in good standing in its jurisdiction of
organization as set forth on _Schedule 2.01_. Each Company Party is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
all jurisdictions in which the ownership of its properties or the nature of

jurisdictions are listed on _Schedule 2.01_. Each Company Party is and at all
times has been in compliance with its organizational documents (correct and
complete copies of which have been delivered to Buyer). The Company Parties
have delivered to Buyer complete and correct copies of their stock ledger and

Company Party or any Seller to perform its or his or her obligations under the
Transaction Documents; provided that none of the following shall constitute,
or shall be considered in determining whether there has occurred, and no
event, circumstance, change or effect resulting from or arising out of any of
the following shall constitute, a Material Adverse Effect: (i) changes in
Governmental Rules or GAAP or official interpretations thereof which do not
have a disproportionate effect (relative to other participants in the industry

(ii) actions or omissions of the Company Parties or the Sellers taken with the
written consent of Buyer in contemplation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; (iii) the announcement of the execution of this Agreement or the
pendency of consummation of the transactions contemplated herein (including
the threatened or actual impact on relationships of any Company Party with
customers, vendors, suppliers or distributors); (iv) macroeconomic factors,

(including without limitation any disruption thereof or any decline in the
price of any security or market index), suspensions of trading, banking
moratoriums, natural disasters, war (whether or not declared), terrorism or
hostilities, or the escalation of war, terrorism or hostilities which, in each
case, do not have a disproportionate effect (relative to other participants in
the industry or markets in which the Company Parties compete) on the Company
Parties taken as a whole; or (v) the failure, in and of itself, of the Company
Parties to meet any published or internally prepared estimates of revenues,
earnings or other financial projections, performance measures or operating
statistics.

(or upon such execution and delivery will constitute) legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company or HHM1 enforceable against the Company or HHM1, as
applicable, in accordance with their respective terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar laws, or by equitable principles, relating to or
limiting the rights of creditors generally and (b) limitations imposed by law
or equitable

 



      
 

 



 

principles upon the availability of specific performance, injunctive relief or
other equitable remedies.

 



 

2.04 _No Breach, Default, Violation or Consent_. Except as set forth on
_Schedule 2.04_ , the execution, delivery and performance by the Company, HHM1
and Sellers of the Transaction Documents do not and will not:

 



 

(a) violate the organizational documents of any Company Party;

 



 

(b) breach or result in a default (or an event which, with the giving of

Permit;

regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended (the " **HSR Act** ");

 



 

except in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (f) above, for such matters as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company Parties or the Sellers ability to perform its
obligations under the Transaction Documents.

 



 

2.05 _Capitalization_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of thirty-five

or any Business Agreement.

 



 

(d) Except for the equity securities of the Subsidiaries disclosed on

partnership interest, joint venture interest or other equity interest in any
other Person.

Article VII 
_CERTAIN POST-CLOSING MATTERS_

 



 

7.01 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement_. As a material
inducement to cause Buyer to enter into this Agreement and consummate the
Closing, the applicable Sellers and Buyer agree as follows:

 



 

(a) _Non-Competition_. For a period commencing on the Closing Date and ending
four (4) years following the Closing Date (the " **Restricted Period** "),
Holly Hunt shall not, directly or indirectly, for herself or for any other
Person, own, manage, operate, control, participate in, serve as a director of,
consultant or advisor to, be employed by or render services for any Competing
Business (as defined below). Holly Hunts ownership of securities of one
percent (1%) or less of any class of securities of a public company shall not,
by itself, be considered to be in competition with the Company Parties or
Buyer or its Affiliates. As used herein, " **Competing Business** " means any
business activity of any Company Party or Buyer or its Affiliates during the
Restricted Period, which business activity, for illustration purposes only, is
anticipated to include the manufacturing, marketing, distributing or selling
of products or services associated with the furniture, leather, lighting,
flooring, carpeting, textiles and applications businesses; provided, however,
that, during the Restricted Period, Holly Hunt has actual knowledge, or
reasonably should have actual knowledge, of the fact that such Company Party
or Buyer or its Affiliates is engaging in such business activity.

 



 

(b) _Non-Solicitation_. During the Restricted Period, Holly Hunt shall not,
directly or indirectly, for herself or for any other Person: (i) employ,
solicit for employment or otherwise contract for the services of any
individual who is or was, during the preceding ninety (90) days, an employee
of any Company Party or Buyer or its Affiliates; (ii) otherwise induce or
attempt to induce any employee of any Company Party or Buyer or its Affiliates
to leave the employ of any Company Party or Buyer or its Affiliates, or in any
way interfere with the relationship between any Company Party or Buyer or its
Affiliates and any employee respectively thereof; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not (A) be violated by general advertising not specifically
targeted at employees of a Company Party or Buyer or its Affiliates or (B)
prohibit Holly Hunt or any of her Affiliates from hiring any person who at
such time was no longer employed by the Company Parties, the Buyer or any of
their Affiliates for a period of at least ninety (90) days, or (C) prohibit
Holly Hunt or any of her Affiliates from hiring Daniel Fierro; or (iii) (y)
induce any such supplier or customer to reduce its business or cease doing
business with any Company Party or Buyer or its Affiliates, or (z) interfere
in any way with the

 



      
 

 



 

relationship between any such supplier or customer and a Company Party or
Buyer or its Affiliates.

 



 

(c) _Non-Disparagement_. Buyer, the Company Parties, Holly Hunt and each
Seller hereby covenants and agrees that he/she/it will not publish or
otherwise issue or make or permit to be made, published or issued on
its/his/her behalf any public or private statements, directly or indirectly,
whether orally or in writing, regarding or relating, directly or indirectly,
to the Sellers, Holly Hunt, Buyer, the Company Parties, their Affiliates,
their officers, directors or shareholders, as applicable, that are either
unlawful, libelous, slanderous, tortious, defamatory, invasive of privacy,
disparaging or otherwise harmful to any such Person or his/her/its reputation
or personal, business or financial interests.

 



 

(d) _Enforcement_. Each party hereto acknowledges that a breach of its
covenants contained in this _Section 7.01_ will cause irreparable damage to
Buyer and the Company Parties or a Seller, as the case may be, the exact
amount of which would be difficult to ascertain, and that the remedies at law
for any such breach or threatened breach would be inadequate. Accordingly,
each party agrees that if such party breaches or threatens to breach any of
the covenants contained in this _Section 7.01_ , in addition to any other
remedy which may be available at law or in equity, the other parties shall be
entitled to specific performance and injunctive relief to prevent the breach
or any threatened breach thereof without bond or other security or a showing
that monetary damages will not provide an adequate remedy.

 



 

(e) _Scope of Covenants_. Each party further acknowledges that the time,
scope, geographic area and other provisions of this _Section 7.01_ have been
specifically negotiated by sophisticated commercial parties and agree that
they consider the restrictions and covenants contained in this _Section 7.01_
to be reasonable and necessary for the protection of the interests of the
Company Parties, Buyer and their respective Affiliates, and the Sellers, but
if any such restriction or covenant shall be held by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be void but would be valid if deleted in part or reduced in
application, such restriction or covenant shall apply with such deletion or
modification as may be necessary to make it valid and enforceable. The
restrictions and covenants contained in each paragraph of this _Section 7.01_
shall be construed as separate and individual restrictions and covenants and
shall each be capable of being severed without prejudice to the other
restrictions and covenants or to the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

7.02 _Seller Release_. Each Seller, on behalf of such Seller, anyone claiming
through such Seller (including such Sellers Affiliates) and the respective
heirs, executors, personal representatives, beneficiaries, successors and
assigns of each of the foregoing (collectively, the " **Releasing Parties**
"), hereby fully, finally and irrevocably releases, acquits and forever
discharges Buyer, the Company Parties, each Affiliate of any of the foregoing,
each current and former equity holder, director, officer, employee and agent
of any of the foregoing and the respective heirs, executors, personal
representatives, successors and assigns of each of the foregoing
(collectively, the " **Released Parties** "), of and from any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs and expenses of every kind and nature
whatsoever, past, present or future, at law or in equity, whether known or
unknown, contingent or otherwise, which any Releasing Party now has, ever had
or may have against any Released Party by reason of any matter, cause or thing
existing as of the Closing Date or arising out of events occurring or
conditions existing

 



      
 

 



 

on or prior to the Closing Date; provided that this release shall not apply to
(a) any claims that any Releasing Party may have against any Released Party
under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents or, in the case
of Seller who is an employee of a Company Party, claims for salary or wages
and benefits which are not past due as of the Closing Date and which are not
included in the Company Expenses, or (b) any claim for indemnification or
contribution by a Seller (or such Sellers heirs, successors, assigns,
executors, affiliates, directors, managers, officers, agents, employees,
members, partners, stockholders, equityholders and their respective
affiliates directors, managers, officers, agents, employees, members,
partners, stockholders, equityholders, successors and assigns), in his/her/its
capacity as a former officer, director, manager or fiduciary of the Company
Parties or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

7.03 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Sellers will be solely responsible for the following Taxes, except to the
extent such Taxes were accrued as a liability in Closing Working Capital
(collectively, " **Seller Tax Liabilities** "): (i) all Taxes imposed upon any
Company Party with respect to any taxable period ending on or before the
Closing Date (a " **Pre-Closing Tax Period** "); and (ii) with respect to any
taxable period or portion thereof beginning before and ending after the
Closing Date (a " **Straddle Period** "), all such Taxes which are allocable,
pursuant to subsection (c) below, to the portion of such taxable period ending
on the Closing Date. Sellers will receive the benefit of all Tax losses,
expenses, deductions and credits incurred by the Company Parties with respect
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods and, with respect to Straddle Periods, the benefit
of all Tax losses, expenses, deductions and credits incurred by the Company
Parties which are allocable, pursuant to subsection (c) below, to the portion
of such taxable period ending on the Closing Date; provided that Sellers are
entitled to such benefit only to the extent that such Tax losses, expenses,
deductions and credits can be used to reduce any Seller Tax Liability
(including obtaining a refund with respect to any period for which a Tax
Return has previously been filed), and Sellers are not entitled to any payment
or other compensation if any Company Party uses the remaining portion of any
such Tax loss, expense, deduction or credit to reduce its Tax liability with
respect to any Post-Closing Tax Period; provided, for federal income tax
purposes, the parties agree that, except as may be otherwise required pursuant
to a final "determination" under section 1313 of the Code, all deductions
(excluding depreciation or amortization of purchase price) attributable to
payments under the 2012 Holly Hunt Enterprises, Inc. Long Term Incentive plan
(other than payments under the LTIP Amendment) shall be for the account of the
Company and Sellers in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, neither the Buyer nor any
Company Party shall claim any such deduction in a Post-Closing Tax Period. If,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer, a Company Party, or any Affiliate
thereof actually receives a tax benefit on account of such a deduction in a
Post-Closing Tax Period, the Buyer shall promptly pay an amount equal to such
benefit to Sellers.

 



 

(b) Buyer or the Company Parties, as applicable, will be solely responsible
for the payment of all Taxes of the Company Parties which are attributable to
(i) any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date (a " **Post-Closing
Tax Period** ") and (ii) the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after
the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) In the case of any income Taxes that are payable with respect to a
Straddle Period, the portion of such income Taxes attributable to the portion
of such Straddle Period

 



      
 

 



 

ending on the Closing Date will be determined on the basis of a deemed closing
of the books and records of the Company Parties as of the close of business on
the Closing Date; provided that annual expenses such as depreciation shall be
prorated on a daily basis. In the case of any other Taxes that are payable
with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes attributable to
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date will be equal
to the product of all such Taxes multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Straddle Period from the commencement of
such period through and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; provided that
appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect specific events that can be
identified and specifically allocated as occurring on or prior to the Closing
Date or occurring after the Closing Date.

 



 

(d) The Sellers will prepare and file (or cause to be prepared and filed) in a
timely manner all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company Parties
(after giving effect to any valid extensions of the due date for filing any
such Tax Returns) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and shall pay all Taxes shown
thereon as due and owing and, to the extent required by law, Buyer shall
execute (or cause to be executed) such Tax Returns. Buyer will prepare and
file (or cause to be prepared and filed) in a timely manner all Tax Returns
required to be filed by the Company Parties (after giving effect to any valid
extensions of the due date for filing any such Tax Returns) for any Straddle
Period included in the Seller Tax Liabilities (such returns, the " **Buyer
Returns** "). The party responsible for preparing and filing a Tax Return will
submit such Tax Returns to other party for review and approval at least thirty
(30) days prior to the filing date (after giving effect to any valid
extensions). Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such Tax Returns, the
reviewing party will give the preparing party notice of any dispute with
respect to such Tax Returns. Buyer and the Seller Representative will promptly
attempt to resolve any disputes with respect to such Tax Returns; provided
that, if they are unable to do so within fifteen (15) days after delivery of
notice of the dispute, such disputed items will be resolved in the same manner
as disputes with respect to the calculation of Closing Working Capital under
_Section 1.03(h)_. Sellers will pay to Buyer on or before the date which is
the later of ten (10) days before the due date of any Buyer Returns (after
giving effect to any valid extensions), or five (5) days after the final
resolution of any dispute, the amount of the Seller Tax Liability as set forth
on such Buyer Return.

 



 

(e) The Sellers are entitled to all refunds (and credits in lieu of a refund)
net of Buyers out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining such refund
(including Tax on any refund or credit), if any, attributable to Taxes of the
Company Parties for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and the pre-Closing portion of
each Straddle Period and, if Buyer or any Company Party receives such a refund
or credit, it will deliver the same to the Seller Representative within ten
(10) days after its receipt thereof. Upon the request of the Seller
Representative and at Sellers expense, Buyer shall cause the Company Parties
to promptly file amended Tax Returns carrying back any net operating or other
losses, or credits, from the final Pre-Closing Tax Period and seeking a refund
of Taxes with respect to prior taxable years, so long as the Tax position
taken in such return is consistent with the Tax position taken by the Company
Parties in prior years and is otherwise in compliance with applicable
Governmental Rules.

 



 

(f) Neither Buyer nor any of the Company Parties will amend any Tax Returns
of, or file any additional Tax Returns with respect to, any of the Company
Parties for

 



      
 

 



 

any Pre-Closing Tax Period or the pre-Closing portion of any Straddle Period
without the Seller Representatives prior written consent, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld (it being understood that it would be
unreasonable to withhold consent to correct a manifest error or make a filing
that is clearly required by applicable Governmental Rule, and that, absent the
foregoing circumstances, it would be reasonable to withhold consent to a
filing that would increase a Seller Tax Liability). Buyer will not, and will
not permit any Company Party to, effect or cause to be effected any
extraordinary transactions or events on the Closing Date with respect to any
Company Party.

 



 

(g) The Seller Representative, on the one hand, and Buyer and the Company
Parties, on the other hand, will provide each other, at no charge, with such
cooperation and information as any of them may reasonably request of the
other(s) in filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund,
determining a liability for Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or
participating in or conducting any audit or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon another partys
request) the provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding, making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any materials provided hereunder and providing or executing the
appropriate power(s) of attorney as necessary to permit the appropriate party
to settle, resolve, control or participate, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, in any Tax-related dispute, claim, audit, examination or
proceeding. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after the
Closing, Buyer shall use its best efforts to cause each of the Company Parties
to fully cooperate with the Seller Representative in connection with the
preparation and filing of each Tax Return and any Tax-related audit or
controversy, the resolution or defense of which is controlled by the Seller
Representative. Buyer agrees to cause the Company Parties (i) to retain all
books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
Parties, relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and any extensions
thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give
the Seller Representative reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the Seller
Representative so requests, Buyer agrees to cause the Company to allow the
Seller Representative to take possession of such books and records.

 



 

(h) All Tax sharing agreements or similar arrangements with respect to or
involving any Company Party (except for any such agreements solely between
Company Parties) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the
Closing Date, no Company Party shall be bound thereby or have any liability
thereunder for amounts due in respect of periods ending on or before the
Closing Date or otherwise.

 



 

(i) If, subsequent to the Closing Date, Buyer, Sellers or any Company Party
receives notice of any audit, other administrative proceeding or inquiry or
judicial proceeding involving Taxes (" **Tax Contest** ") with respect to
which any Buyer Indemnified Party claims a right to indemnification under this
Agreement (a " **Tax Claim** "), then within fifteen (15) days after receipt
of such notice, Buyer shall notify Seller Representative, or Seller
Representative shall notify Buyer, as applicable, of such notice; provided,
however, that any failure on the part of Buyer to so notify Seller
Representative shall not limit any of the indemnification obligations of the
Sellers under Article VIII (except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the

 



      
 

 



 

defense of such Tax Claim). If the Tax Claim relates to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period, except for any Tax
Contest related to the Companys S corporation status, Seller Representative
shall have the right to control the conduct and resolution of such Tax
Contest, provided that Seller Representative shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed of all material developments on a timely basis and Seller
Representative shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on the Taxes of the
Company Parties or Buyer for any Post-Closing Tax Period without Buyers
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed. Buyer shall control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Claim
that Seller Representative does not control pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence; provided that Buyer shall keep Seller Representative
reasonably informed of all material developments on a timely basis and Buyer
shall not resolve such Tax Contest in a manner that could reasonably be
expected to have an adverse impact on the Seller Tax Liability or Sellers
indemnification obligations under this Agreement without Seller
Representatives written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Each party shall bear its own costs in connection with
this _Section 7.03(i)_. In the event of any conflict between this _Section
7.03(i)_ and the provisions of _Section 8.03_ , the provisions of this
_Section 7.03(i)_ shall control.

 



 

7.04 _Access to Information_. After the Closing, Buyer will cause the Company
Parties to make available to the Seller Representative, for any proper
purpose, any and all books and records of the Company Parties existing on the
Closing Date; provided that such access will be upon reasonable prior notice,
during normal business hours, at Sellers expense and conducted in a manner so
as not to unreasonably interfere with the Company Parties business. Buyer
will cause the Company Parties to hold all of such books and records for a
period of six (6) years from the Closing Date unless, at least sixty (60) days
prior to disposing of the same, Buyer offers in writing to surrender them to
the Seller Representative.

 



 

7.05 _Employment_.

 



 

(a) Buyer will cause the Company Parties to continue the employment of all
Company Party employees on terms at least as favorable as in existence as of
the Closing Date, including without limitation base wages, salaries and
employee benefits, with no terminations for a period of one hundred twenty
(120) days following the Closing (subject to the Company Parties right to
terminate the employment of employees in the ordinary course of business for
cause).

 



 

(b) In addition, Buyer will cause the Company Parties to, as of the Closing
Date and continuing through the end of calendar year 2014, (i) recognize such
employees employment service with the Company Parties and/or the Subsidiaries
(including credit for service with predecessor employers as currently
recognized under the applicable plan) for participation, vesting and benefit
eligibility purposes under any 401(k) plan, vacation and leave policies that
the Company Parties and/or any of their Subsidiaries may provide to such
employees to the extent credited for the same purpose under a similar Plan
prior to the Closing Date, and except as would result in any duplication of
benefits or compensation, (ii) in the plan year in which the Closing occurs,
recognize any deductible, co-payment, out-of-pocket maximum or similar
requirement under the Company Parties and/or any Subsidiarys health plans to
the extent of amounts previously credited for such purposes under the
comparable plans,

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) in the plan year in which the Closing occurs, not apply to such
employees any waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions or
requirements to show evidence of good health contained in any of the Company
Parties and/or any Subsidiarys health plans to the extent waiting periods,
pre-existing condition exclusions or requirements were satisfied under the
corresponding Plans and (iv) recognize and honor in full all accrued but
unused vacation as of the Closing Date.

 



 

7.06 _Directors and Officers Liability_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Company Parties shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under the Company
Parties constituent documents or under applicable law, the individuals who on
or prior to the Closing Date were directors, managers, officers, employees or
agents of the Company Parties or any of the Subsidiaries with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request
of the Company parties or any of the Subsidiaries at any time on or prior to
the Closing Date. For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, Buyer shall
not, and shall not permit the Company Parties or any Subsidiary to, amend,
repeal or modify any provision in the Company Parties or any Subsidiaries
constituent documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification of such
Persons prior to the date of such amendment, repeal or modification, it being
the intent of the parties that such Persons shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation and indemnification to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable law. Sellers agree to purchase, at their cost and expense, a six
(6) year tail insurance policy to provide a source of funding for the Company
Parties indemnification obligations under this _Section 7.06_ (the " **D andO
Tail Insurance**"). All rights to indemnification as provided in any
indemnification agreements with any current or former directors, managers,
officers, employees or agents of the Company Parties or any of the
Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters
occurring at or prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing. In addition,
the Company Parties shall pay the expenses of any such indemnitee to the
extent provided in the Company Parties constituent documents or as permitted
under applicable law; provided that the Person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances to the extent required by
applicable law.

 



 

(b) In the event Buyer, the Company Parties or any of the Subsidiaries, or any
of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to any Person, Buyer shall ensure that proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer, the
Company Parties or the Subsidiaries (as applicable) assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 7.06_.

 



 

(c) This _Section 7.06_ , which shall survive the Closing and shall continue
for the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit any natural person
referenced in this _Section 7.06_ , each of whom may enforce the provisions of
this _Section 7.06_ (whether or not parties to this Agreement). The
obligations of the Buyer and the Company Parties under this _Section 7.06_
shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect
any indemnitee to whom this _Section 7.06_ applies without the express written
consent of such affected indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.06_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.06_ ).

 



      
 

 



 

7.07 _Seller Representation_. Each of the parties hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, managers, members, stockholders,
partners, officers, employees and Affiliates, that Vedder Price P.C. may serve

negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Vedder Price P.C. (or
any successor) may serve as counsel to the Seller Group or any director,
manager, member, stockholder, partner, officer, employee or Affiliate of the
Seller Group, in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or any Transaction Document or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby notwithstanding such

Subsidiaries, and the Seller Representative and Buyer hereby consents thereto
and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of the Seller

records related to such transaction will become property of (and be controlled
by) the Sellers, and neither Buyer nor the Company Parties or any of the
Subsidiaries shall retain any copies of such records or have any access to
them.

 



 

7.08 _Grant of Restricted Stock_. As soon as reasonably practicable following

reduced and limited to that amount necessary to prevent the recognition by a
Company Party of a loss on the merchandise sale, with such loss being measured
against the direct cost of the merchandise. In addition, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, it is understood and agreed that
Holly Hunt is the founder of the Company and solely personal records, archives

Note.

 



 

Article VIII 
_INDEMNIFICATION_

 



 

8.01 _Indemnification by Sellers_. The Sellers will jointly and severally
defend, indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and (after the Closing) the Company
Parties and their respective Affiliates, equity holders, directors, officers,
employees and agents, and the heirs, successors and assigns of each (each a "
**Buyer Indemnified Party** ") from and against any and all claims (including
without limitation any Proceeding, whether instituted by a third party against
a Buyer Indemnified Party or by a Buyer Indemnified Party for the purpose of
enforcing its rights hereunder), damages, losses, liabilities, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs and expenses (including without limitation
reasonable attorneys and consultants fees and expenses and including any
such reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
investigating, defending against or settling any of the foregoing)
(collectively, " **Losses** "), as and when incurred, that result from, or
arise out of or in connection with:

 



 

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Article II (a "
**Company Warranty Breach** ") or Article III (a " **Seller Warranty Breach**
");

 



 

(b) any default by the Company (prior to the Closing) or Sellers in the
performance or observance of any of their covenants or agreements hereunder or
under any other Transaction Document;

 



 

(c) any Company Debt, Unpaid Company Expense or Excluded Liability that is not
satisfied at Closing; and

 



 

(d) any matter described on _Schedule 8.01(d)_.

 



 

In addition, if Holly Hunt Do Brasil Importacao E Comercio De Mobiliarios LTDA
(" **HH Brasil** ") generates an operating loss (as reflected in the income
statement of HH Brasil prepared in a manner consistent with that used by HH
Brasil in preparing its historical financial statements) in excess of One
Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($100,000) for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2014, Sellers will jointly and severally indemnify and hold harmless the

 



      
 

 



 

Company Parties against, and reimburse the Company Parties for, any such
excess up to but not exceeding the next Four Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars
($400,000) of operating losses. In the event the Seller Representative
disagrees with the determination of the operating loss prepared by the Company
Parties, Seller Representative may, at the expense of Sellers, conduct an
audit of the income statement of HH Brasil. Any amounts owed by Sellers
pursuant to this Section will be paid within ten (10) days of final
determination of the operating loss of HH Brasil.

 



 

8.02 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer will defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers and their respective Affiliates, equity holders, directors,
officers, employees and agents (each a " **Seller Indemnified Party** ") from
and against any and all Losses, as and when incurred, that constitute, or
arise out of or in connection with:

 



 

(a) any misrepresentation or breach of warranty under Article IV (a " **Buyer
Warranty Breach** ");

 



 

(b) any default by Buyer or (after the Closing) the Company Parties in the
performance or observance of any of its covenants or agreements hereunder or
under any other Transaction Document; or

 



 

(c) any amounts drawn on the Northern LCs prior to the collateral provided by
Sellers being released in accordance with _Section 1.02(a)(i)_.

 



 

8.03 _Third-Party Claims_.

 



 

(a) If any action, suit, audit, investigation, claim or other proceeding (each
a " **Proceeding** ") is initiated against any Buyer Indemnified Party or
Seller Indemnified Party (each an " **Indemnitee** ") by any third party and
such Indemnitee intends to seek indemnification from Sellers or Buyer (each an
" **Indemnitor** "), as applicable, under this Article on account of its
involvement in such Proceeding, then such Indemnitee will give prompt notice
to the applicable Indemnitor of such Proceeding; provided, that the failure to
so notify such Indemnitor will not relieve such Indemnitor of its obligations
under this Article except to the extent such failure has materially and
adversely affected the Indemnitors ability to defend successfully such
Proceeding. Upon receipt of such notice, such Indemnitor shall diligently
defend against such Proceeding on behalf of such Indemnitee at Indemnitors
own expense using counsel reasonably acceptable to such Indemnitee such
acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. The Seller
Representative shall not be entitled to assume or continue the control of such
defense if such Proceeding (i) relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation; or (ii)
seeks an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief against
any Indemnitee (except where such equitable relief is merely incidental to a
primary claim or claims for monetary damages); or (iii) involves a claim
which, upon petition by a Buyer Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules
that the Seller Representative failed or is failing to reasonably and
diligently prosecute or defend; provided, that clause (i)-(iii) shall not be
deemed to apply to the matters described on _Schedule 8.01(d)_. An Indemnitor
or Indemnitee, as applicable, may participate in any Proceeding being defended
against by the other at its own expense (which expense shall not constitute a
Loss unless joint representation would present a material conflict as
determined by reputable counsel). If the Indemnitee elects to participate in
such defense, the Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnitor in the
conduct of such defense of such Proceeding.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Neither the Indemnitor or Indemnitee may concede, settle or compromise any
Proceeding without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; provided, however, if the Indemnitor is the
Seller Representative then the Indemnitor shall be entitled to settle such
Proceeding if such settlement (i) is confidential (except as otherwise
required by applicable Law), (ii) includes an unconditional release of all
Buyer Indemnified Parties from all liabilities that are the subject matter of
such Proceeding, (iii) does not contain any admission of wrongdoing, (iv)
includes only the payment of monetary damages by Sellers only in an amount
that is equal to or less than the Cap and no other remedy or relief, and (v)
the settlement is not, in the good faith judgment of Buyer, reasonably likely
to be materially adverse to the Buyers reputation or continuing business
interests (including its relationships with current or potential customers,
suppliers or other parties material to the conduct of its business).

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (i) with
respect to any actions to be taken by an Indemnitee under this Article VIII, "
**Indemnitee** " shall mean Buyer or the Seller Representative, as applicable,
and, with respect to any actions to be taken by any Seller as an Indemnitor
under this Article VIII, other than such Sellers obligation to pay such
Sellers portion of Losses, " **Indemnitor** " shall mean the Seller
Representative, and (ii) with respect to the matters set forth on _Schedule
8.01(d)_ , the Seller Representative shall have the sole right to control and
defend any Proceedings related thereto, the cost and expenses included in the
Losses related thereto shall not include any of the Company Parties internal
allocated cost or overhead including, without limitation, any costs or
expenses of the Company Parties internal legal department and/or human
resource professionals, and the Company Parties shall endeavor to not incur
any outside costs or expenses in connection therewith.

 



 

8.04 _Notice and Satisfaction of Indemnification Claims_. No indemnification
claim will be deemed to have been asserted until the applicable Indemnitor has
been given notice by the Indemnitee of the amount of such claim and the facts
on which such claim is based (in each case to the extent known). For purposes
of _Section 8.05_ , notice of an indemnification claim will be deemed to cover
claims arising out of all related Proceedings so long as, in the case of
Proceedings instituted by third parties, the Indemnitee complies with _Section
8.03_. If the Indemnitee is not Buyer or the Seller Representative, then such
notice will be given on behalf of such Indemnitee by Buyer or the Seller
Representative, as applicable.

 



 

In the event any Indemnitee should have a claim against any Indemnitor that
does not involve a Proceeding (a " **Direct Claim** "), the Indemnitee shall
promptly deliver written notice of such Direct Claim to the Indemnifying
Party, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the amount, or an
estimate of the amount, of the Losses arising therefrom and the basis therefor
(to the extent known). If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee that it does
not dispute the Direct Claim described in such notice, the Losses in the
amount specified in the Indemnitees notice shall be deemed a liability of the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall pay the amount of such Losses to the
Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after the Indemnitors receipt of such
Direct Claim. If the Indemnitor gives notice to the Indemnitee that it
disputes the Direct Claim or fails to notify the Indemnitee whether the
Indemnitor disputes the Direct Claim described in such notice, the Indemnitee
may pursue its indemnification rights hereunder and whatever other legal
remedies may be available to enforce its rights under this Article VIII.

 



      
 

 



 

8.05 _Duration of Certain Indemnification Obligations_. All representations,
warranties, covenants, and obligations in this Agreement will survive the
Closing and the consummation and performance of the transactions contemplated
hereby for the time periods described in this _Section 8.05_. Claims for
indemnification under _Section 8.01(a)_ and _8.02(a)_ may only be asserted
within the following time periods:

 



 

(a) claims arising out of (i) any Company Warranty Breach under Section 2.01
(Organization and Qualification), Section 2.02 (Power and Authority), Section
2.03 (Execution and Enforceability), Section 2.05 (Capitalization), Section
2.19 (Title Matters) or Section 2.24 (Brokers), or out of any Seller Warranty
Breach under Section 3.01 (Organization and Qualification), Section 3.02
(Power and Authority), Section 3.03 (Execution and Enforceability), Section
3.05 (Title to Shares) or Section 3.06 (Brokers) (collectively, and including
Section 2.07 (Tax Matters) (for all purposes but this Section 8.05(a), "
**Sellers  Fundamental Warranties**")) or (ii) any Buyer Warranty Breach
under Section 4.01 (Organization), Section 4.02 (Power and Authority), Section
4.03 (Execution and Enforceability), Section 4.05 (Brokers), Section 4.08
(Investment Representations), Section 4.09 (Solvency) or Section 4.11
(Independent Investigation) (collectively, " **Buyer s Fundamental
Warranties**"), and any claims arising out of willful misrepresentation or
fraud, may be asserted at any time;

 



 

(b) claims arising out of or in connection with any Company Warranty Breach
under _Section 2.07_ (Tax Matters) or _Section 2.15_ (Pension and Welfare
Plans) may be asserted until sixty (60) days after the running of the statute
of limitations applicable to the taxable period to which a particular claim
relates;

 



 

(c) claims arising out of or in connection with any Company Warranty Breach
under _Section 2.11_ (Environmental Matters) may be asserted for a period of
thirty-six (36) months after the Closing Date; and

 



 

(d) all other claims for indemnification under _Sections 8.01(a)_ and
_8.02(a)_ may be asserted until the completion of the audited financial
statements for the Company Parties 2014 fiscal year, but in no event later
than April 15, 2015.

 



 

The survival periods set forth in this _Section 8.05_ with respect to claims
for indemnification under _Section 8.01(a)_ or _8.02(a)_ are in lieu of, and
the parties expressly waive, any otherwise applicable statute of limitations.
No party shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representations and warranties unless a claim is made hereunder prior to the
expiration of the survival period described in this _Section 8.05_ for such
representation and warranty, in which case such representation and warranty
shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.

 



 

8.06 _Indemnification Threshold and Cap_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no Indemnitor will have any
indemnification obligations under _Section 8.01(a)_ (exclusive of a Company
Warranty Breach or a Seller Warranty Breach involving any of Sellers
Fundamental Warranties, willful misrepresentation or fraud) or _Section
8.02(a)_ (exclusive of a Buyer Warranty Breach involving

 



      
 

 



 

any of Buyers Fundamental Warranties, willful misrepresentation or fraud)
unless and until the Losses with respect to claims asserted against such
Indemnitor exceed Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars ($500,000) in the
aggregate (the " **Threshold Amount** "); thereafter, such Indemnitor will be
liable for the Losses for which indemnification claims properly asserted
against it, in excess of the Threshold Amount _plus_ Two Hundred Fifty
Thousand U.S. Dollars ($250,000) of the Threshold Amount.

 



 

(b) The aggregate amount of Losses for which the Sellers shall be liable under
_Section 8.01(a)_ and _Section 8.01(d)_ shall not exceed Ten Million U.S.
Dollars ($10,000,000) (the " **Cap** ") or, in the case of Company Warranty
Breaches or Seller Warranty Breaches involving any of Sellers Fundamental
Warranties, willful misrepresentation or fraud, the Purchase Price.

 



 

(c) The parties acknowledge and agree that no Seller shall be obligated to
indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to any matter or item to
the extent that such matter or item was included in the final determination of
the Working Capital.

 



 

8.07 _Buyer s Right of Setoff_. Subject to any applicable limitations set
forth in this Article VIII, Buyer may, on one or more occasions, withhold all
or any portion of any payment under _Section 1.03_ and retain such amount or
amounts withheld in order to discharge, or reimburse any Buyer Indemnified
Party for, any Losses for which any Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this Article VIII; provided, that such Losses have been
mutually agreed upon by Seller Representative and Buyer or have been finally
determined by a court order and are non-appealable. Buyers rights under this
_Section 8.06_ shall be in addition to, and not in limitation of, any other
rights or remedies of Buyer under this Article VIII.

 



 

8.08 _No Circular Recovery_. Notwithstanding (and as an exception to the
obligations under ) _Section 7.06_ , above, after the Closing, no Seller and
no Affiliate of a Seller shall make any claim for indemnification against
Buyer or any Company Party or their respective Affiliates by reason of the
fact that such Seller or its Affiliates was a controlling Person, director,
officer, employee, agent or other representative of any Company Party or its
Affiliates, with respect to any claim brought by a Buyer Indemnified Party
against such Seller pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

8.09 _Other Limitations on Indemnification Provisions_. Losses of any Buyer
Indemnified Party shall be reduced by (i) the aggregate amount of any
insurance proceeds actually received by such Buyer Indemnified Party from
third-party insurance providers, net of any deductibles and costs (including
costs related to premium increases or the erosion of coverage limits) with
respect to such Losses, in each case, solely related to the submission of a
claim for insurance coverage for such Losses, (ii) the aggregate amount
actually recovered, net of any reasonable and documented costs, expenses and
fees incurred in respect of such recovery, under any indemnity agreement,
contribution agreement or contract between any Buyer Indemnified Party, on the
one hand, and any third-party, on the other hand, and (iii) the aggregate
amount of any Tax benefit (if any) realized by any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Tax periods as a result of such Losses after taking into
account the income Tax consequences to such Buyer Indemnified Parties for the
taxable year of receipt of the relevant indemnification payment. If an
indemnification payment is received by any Buyer Indemnified Party and such
Buyer Indemnified Party later receives insurance proceeds, other third-party
recoveries or Tax benefits in respect of the related Losses that were not
previously credited

 



      
 

 



 

against such indemnification payment when made, such Buyer Indemnified Party
shall promptly pay to the Seller Representative (for the benefit of the
Sellers) an amount equal to the lesser of (A) such insurance proceeds, other
third party recoveries and Tax benefits with respect to such Losses and (B)
the indemnification payment previously paid by the Sellers with respect to
such Losses. Each Buyer Indemnified Party shall use reasonable and good faith
efforts to collect amounts available under insurance coverages and to the
extent commercially reasonable in light of business circumstances, use
commercially reasonable efforts to pursue such claims relating to any Losses
for which it is seeking indemnification from third parties. In addition, each
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will take all reasonable steps to
mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event which could reasonably
be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable or recoverable
hereunder.

 



 

8.10 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except for such equitable remedies as may be
available to enforce the provisions of _Sections 7.01_ , _9.02_ and _9.07_ ,
and except in the case of claims based on willful misrepresentation or fraud,
the indemnifications under this Article VIII are the parties sole and
exclusive remedies, each against the other, with respect to matters arising
under this Agreement, of any kind or nature. The parties hereby waive and
release any other rights, remedies, causes of action or claims arising under
this Agreement, of any kind or nature.

 



 

8.11 _Tax Treatment_. Any indemnification payments under this Article VIII
will be treated, for Tax purposes, as adjustments to the Purchase Price.

 



 

Article IX 
_GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 



 

9.01 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any right, interest or
obligation hereunder may be assigned, pledged or otherwise transferred by any
party, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior consent of
the other party or parties; provided that (a) Buyer may assign its rights
hereunder to an Affiliate so long as Buyer remains liable hereunder, and may
collaterally assign its rights hereunder to any lender and (b) any party may

equity holders, customers, suppliers, distributors, sales representatives and

obtained by the other party from a source other than the party to whom such
Confidential Information belongs (or any of its Affiliates or their respective
officers, directors, employees, equity holders or agents) so long as, in the
case of information obtained from a third party, to the applicable partys
knowledge, such third party was not or is not, directly or indirectly, subject
to an obligation of confidentiality owed to the party to whom such
Confidential Information belongs or any of its Affiliates at the time such
Confidential Information was or is disclosed to the other party.

all such actions as are necessary or desirable in order to ensure that each of
such Persons maintains the confidentiality of any Confidential Information
that is so disclosed;

 



 

(ii) make additional disclosures of or use for its own benefit Confidential
Information of the other party, but only if and to the extent that such
disclosures or uses are specifically contemplated by this Agreement; and

_Section 9.02_. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, a party is compelled to disclose any Confidential
Information to any court or tribunal, such Person may disclose the
Confidential Information to such court or tribunal.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this _Section 9.02_ , all
information that constitutes Confidential Information of the Company Parties

proceeding relating thereto except in such courts). Each party further agrees
that service of any process, summons, notice or document hand delivered or
sent by U.S. registered mail to such partys respective address set forth in
_Section 9.06_ will be effective service of process for any action, suit or
proceeding in any such courts with respect to any matters to which it has
submitted to jurisdiction as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.
Each party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection to the laying
of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to the

action, suit or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and
may be enforced by suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction or in any other
manner provided at law or in equity.

 



 

(b) Each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives all right to
trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, this Agreement, any provision hereof or the breach,
performance, enforcement, validity or invalidity of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

 



 

9.11 _Miscellaneous_. This Agreement: (a) may be amended only by a writing

obligations under this Agreement may be waived only by a writing signed by the
party against whom enforcement of such waiver is sought, and any such waiver
will be effective only to the extent specifically set forth in such writing.
The waiver by a party of any breach or violation of any provision of this
Agreement will not operate as, or be construed to be, a waiver of any
subsequent breach or violation hereof. Any provision of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining portions hereof or
affecting the validity or enforceability of such provision in any other
jurisdiction.
