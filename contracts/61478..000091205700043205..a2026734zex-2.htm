Merger Sub and the Company are sometimes collectively referred to as the " _Constituent Corporations._ " 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have determined that it is advisable and in the best interests of the respective corporations and their stockholders that Merger Sub be merged with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to which the Company will be the surviving corporation and will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the " _Merger_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, for financial reporting purposes the parties intend that the Merger shall be accounted for as a "pooling of interests" under Opinion 16 of the Accounting Principles Board and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") (collectively, " _Opinion 16_"). The Company has provided to Parent an opinion letter from its independent accountants, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, addressed to the Company, stating that, based on its familiarity with the Company, the Company will qualify as a party to a pooling-of-interests transaction under Opinion 16. Parent has provided to the Company an opinion letter from its independent accountants, Arthur Andersen LLP, addressed to Parent, stating that, as of the date of such letter, based on its familiarity with Parent, Parent will qualify as a party to a pooling-of-interests transaction under Opinion 16; and 

  

 WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is the intent of the parties that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and that this Agreement constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of the Code; 

   

 WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in connection with, and establish various conditions precedent to, the Merger; and 

  

 WHEREAS, as an inducement to Parent to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company are concurrently herewith entering into a voting agreement in the form of _Exhibit A_ hereto, whereby each such stockholder agrees to vote in favor of the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement and in the Certificate of Merger (as defined in Section 1.03 hereof), the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

under the federal Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or applicable state
securities laws and may not be sold, transferred, assigned, pledged, offered
or otherwise disposed in the absence of an effective registration statement
under applicable securities laws or an opinion of counsel reasonably
satisfactory to Parent that such registration is not required."

   

  

 2.02 _ Stock Options_ 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under the Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Option_ "), whether vested or unvested, shall be assumed by Parent and converted into an option (each, a " _Parent Option_ " ) to acquire, on substantially the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Company Option, the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock), and the per share exercise price of the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Parent Option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (rounded up to the nearest whole cent). The Company shall not, and shall cause any administrator of the Company\'s 1998 Stock Plan not to, take any action prior to the Effective Time that will extend the exercise period of any Company Option or cause the vesting period of any Company Option to accelerate under any circumstances, regardless of whether such circumstances are to occur before or after the Effective Time, or otherwise amend the terms of outstanding Company Options. 

     (b) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery
upon exercise of the Parent Options. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but no later than fifteen days after the Effective Time,
Parent shall file a registration statement with the SEC on Form S-8 (or any
successor form) or another appropriate form with respect to the Parent Common
Stock subject to such Parent Options, and shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the
prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent
Options remain outstanding.

  

 (c) In the case of any Company Option to which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of Section 422 of the Code (" _Incentive Stock Options_ "), the option exercise price, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code. 

  

 (d) Parent will make good faith efforts to ensure, to the extent permitted by the Code and to the extent required by and subject to the terms of any such Incentive Stock Options, that Company Options which qualified as Incentive Stock Options prior to the Effective Date continue to qualify as Incentive Stock Options of Parent after the Effective Date. Parent makes no representation regarding the qualification of such Company Options as Incentive Stock Options. Parent gives no guarantee or assurances of any particular result with respect to Taxes (as defined in Section 3.13 hereof) for any holder of Company Options. 

  

 (e) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deliver to the holders of Company Options appropriate notices setting forth such holders\' rights pursuant to such Company Options (including without limitation, the number of shares the option is exercisable for and the exercise price thereof, each as adjusted by the Merger) and, except as provided herein, the agreements evidencing such Company Options shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions. 

  

 2.03 _ Exchange of Certificates._ 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a commercial bank, trust company or other financial institution, which may include Parent\'s stock transfer agent, to act as exchange agent (" _Exchange Agent_ ") in the Merger. 

  

 (b) Within five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article II, (i) the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto, and (ii) cash in an amount sufficient to permit payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.01(h) (the " _Exchange Fund_ "); _provided, however_ , that, on behalf of the holders of Company Capital Stock, and pursuant to Article X hereof, Parent shall deposit into an escrow account a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Escrow Amount out of the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 (the " _Escrow Fund_ "). The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each holder of Company Capital Stock shall be in proportion to the aggregate number of shares of Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive under Section 2.01 by virtue of ownership of outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock. 

  

 (c) Within five business days after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which shall be in 

    customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent
Common Stock. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number
of whole shares of Parent Common Stock (less the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on such holder\'s behalf
pursuant to Section 2.01(d)), plus cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.01, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.01,
each Certificate that, prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of
Company Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for
all corporate purposes other than the payment of dividends, to evidence the
right to receive the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which
such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted and the
right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional
shares in accordance with Section 2.01(h).

  

 (d) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official in compliance with any abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (f) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Capital Stock except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by law. 

  

 (g) Subject to any applicable escheat or similar laws, any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Date shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former stockholders of the Company shall thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claim for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in exchange for their shares of Company Capital Stock pursuant to the terms of Section 2.01 hereof. 

  

 (h) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact, in form and substance acceptable to the Exchange Agent, by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, and complying with such other conditions as the Exchange Agent may reasonably impose (including the execution of an indemnification undertaking or the posting of an indemnity bond or other surety in favor of the Exchange Agent and Parent with respect to the Certificate alleged to be lost, stolen or destroyed), the Exchange Agent will deliver to such person such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof. 

  

 2.04 _ Dissenting Shares._ For purposes of this Agreement, " _Dissenting Shares_ " means Company Capital Stock held as of the Effective Time by a Company stockholder who has not voted such Company Capital Stock in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger and with respect to 

    which appraisal rights have been duly demanded and perfected in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL and not effectively withdrawn or forfeited prior
to the Effective Time. Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive Parent Common Stock, unless such Company
stockholder shall have forfeited his, her or its right to appraisal under the
DGCL or properly withdrawn his, her or its demand for appraisal. If such
Company stockholder has so forfeited or withdrawn his, her or its right to
appraisal of Dissenting Shares, then (a) as of the occurrence of such event,
such holder\'s Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall
be converted into and represent the right to receive shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in respect of such Company Capital Stock pursuant to Article
II, and (b) promptly following the occurrence of such event, Parent shall
deliver to the Exchange Agent a certificate representing the shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Article II, less the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be placed in escrow pursuant to Section
2.01(d) hereof, and shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate
representing such remaining shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder
is entitled (which shares shall be considered a part of the Escrow Amount for
all purposes of this Agreement).

  

 The Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any Company Capital Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments that relate to such demands received by the Company and (b) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

The Disclosure Letter shall be arranged in sections and paragraphs corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and paragraphs contained in this Article III. The disclosures in any section or paragraph of the Disclosure Letter shall qualify as disclosures with respect to other sections and paragraphs in this Article III to the extent that it is reasonably apparent from the reading of such disclosure that it also qualifies or applies to such other sections or paragraphs.

The Company and each of the Subsidiaries is duly qualified as a foreign corporation to do business in every jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or its ownership of property requires it to be so qualified, except for those jurisdictions in which the failure to be so qualified would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below).

During the period ending upon the date when all obligations under this Agreement have been discharged (including all indemnification obligations pursuant to Article X hereof), the holders of Company Capital Stock who immediately prior to the Effective Date held Company Capital Stock representing an aggregate number of shares of Company Capital Stock which exceeds 50% of the amount of such Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Date (a " _Majority_ ") may from time to time upon written notice to the Stockholders\' Representative and Parent remove the Stockholders\' Representative or appoint a new Stockholders\' Representative to fill any vacancy created by the death, incapacitation, resignation or removal of the Stockholders\' Representative, and if the Stockholders\' Representative dies, becomes incapacitated, resigns or is removed by a Majority, the Majority shall appoint a successor Stockholders\' Representative to fill the vacancy so created. If the Majority is required to but has not appointed a successor Stockholders\' Representative within 30 days from a request by Parent to appoint a successor Stockholders\' Representative, Parent shall have the right to appoint a Stockholders\' Representative to fill the vacancy so created, and shall advise all those who were holders of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Date of such appointment by written notice. A copy of any appointment by the Majority of any successor Stockholders\' Representative shall be provided to Parent promptly after it shall have been effected. 

  

 The adoption of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger by the Company stockholders shall constitute approval of the Escrow Agreement, the Registration Rights Agreement and of all of the respective arrangements relating thereto, including without limitation the placement of the Escrow Amount in escrow and the appointment of David R. Paolino as the Stockholders\' Representative with the authority to act on their behalf as set forth herein and therein. 

  

 8.03 _ Authority._ The Stockholders\' Representative shall be authorized to take action and to make and deliver any certificate, notice, consent or instrument required or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement or under the documents referred to in this Agreement (including, without limitation, the Escrow Agreement) (an " _Instrument_ ") which the Stockholders\' Representative determines in his discretion to be necessary, appropriate or desirable, and, in connection therewith, to hire or retain, at the sole expense of the Company\'s stockholders, such counsel, investment bankers, accountants, representatives and other professional advisors as he determines in his sole and absolute discretion to be necessary, advisable or appropriate in order to carry out and perform the Stockholders\' Representative\'s rights and obligations hereunder. Any party receiving an Instrument from the Stockholders\' Representative shall have the right to rely in good faith and without gross negligence or bad faith upon such certification, and to act in accordance with the Instrument without independent investigation. 

  

 8.04 _ No Liability of Parent._ Parent shall have no liability to any stockholder of the Company or otherwise arising out of the acts or omissions of the Stockholders\' Representative or any disputes among the Company\'s stockholders. Parent shall have no direct liability to the stockholders of the Company under this Agreement or the other agreements referred to herein and may rely entirely on its dealings with, and notices to and from, the Stockholders\' Representative to satisfy any obligations it 

    might have under this Agreement, any agreement referred to herein or
otherwise to the stockholders of the Company.

  

 8.05 _ Limited Liability of Stockholders\' Representative._ The Stockholders\' Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement or Registration Rights Agreement in good faith and without gross negligence or bad faith as the Stockholders\' Representative. By virtue of their approval of this Agreement and the Merger, the Company stockholders hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify the Stockholders\' Representative for, and hold him harmless against, any loss, liability or expense incurred in good faith and without gross negligence or bad faith on the part of Stockholders\' Representative and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder. 

  

 8.06 _ Reimbursement and Advances._ The Stockholders\' Representative shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Escrow Amount for any and all indemnification expenses in accordance with terms of the Escrow Agreement, including cash advances (not to exceed $1,000,000 in the aggregate per each twelve month period beginning at the Closing Date until the Escrow Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms) from the Escrow Amount to pay all costs and expenses, including those of any legal counsel or other professional or consultant, expert or other similar individuals or firms retained by the Stockholders\' Representative, in connection with the acceptance and administration of the Stockholders\' Representative\'s duties, all as further set forth in the Escrow Agreement.

 (a) by the mutual consent of Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) and the Company; 

  

 (b) by either Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) or the Company if there has been a material misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant on the part of the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other, in the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement and such material misrepresentation or breach of warranty or breach of covenant (i) is not cured by the breaching party within 30 days following the receipt by the breaching party of a notice from the non-breaching party of any such breach and (ii) would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have (A) in the case of a termination by Parent, a Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) in the case of a termination by the Company, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, as applicable; 

  

 (c) by either Parent (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub) or the Company if the transactions contemplated hereby have not been consummated by December 31, 2000; _provided, that_ , neither Parent nor the Company will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.01(c) if such party\'s willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby; 

  

 (d) by Parent if, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, there shall have been a Company Material Adverse Effect or if, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, an event shall have occurred which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen, would result in any Company Material Adverse Effect; _except_ to the extent that (i) the Company is capable of taking action to cure the Company Material Adverse Effect of such change or such event and the Company has taken such action within 30 days following the earlier to occur of the Company\'s discovery of such change or event and receipt by the Company of written notice from Parent that such a change or such an event has occurred, or (ii) such change is directly caused by Parent or Merger Sub; or 

   ##

  

 (e) by Company if, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, there shall have been a Parent Material Adverse Effect or if, after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, an event shall have occurred which, so far as reasonably can be foreseen, would result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect; _except_ to the extent that (i) Parent is capable of taking action to cure the Parent Material Adverse Effect of such change or such event and Parent has taken such action within 30 days following the earlier to occur of Parent\'s discovery of such change or event and receipt by Parent of written notice from the Company that such a change or such an event has occurred, or (ii) such change is directly caused by the Company. 

  

 9.02 _ Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 9.01 hereof, all provisions of this Agreement shall terminate and there shall be no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, or Parent\'s or Merger Sub\'s stockholders, officers, or directors or the Company or the Company\'s stockholders, officers or directors, _except_ that: (i) Sections 6.16 (Nonsolicitation), 11.01 (press releases), 11.02 (expenses) and 11.11 (governing law) hereof shall survive indefinitely, (ii) all Company information disclosed to Parent in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall remain subject to that certain Nondisclosure Agreement, dated April 27, 1999, by and between the Company and Parent, and (iii) the parties shall remain liable for their willful or fraudulent breaches of this Agreement prior to the time of such termination. 

   
 

ARTICLE X 
SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

   

 10.01 _ Survival of Representations and Warranties._ Notwithstanding any investigation made by or on behalf of any of the parties hereto or the results of any such investigation and notwithstanding the participation of such party in the Closing, the representations and warranties contained in Article III hereof shall survive the Closing for the greater of the following periods: (a) one year from the Effective Date, or (b) with respect to any specific representation or warranty under which a party shall have made a claim for indemnification hereunder prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date and as to which such claim has not been completely and finally resolved prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, such representation or warranty shall survive for the period of time beyond the first anniversary of the Effective Date sufficient to resolve, completely and finally, the claim relating to such representation or warranty. This Section 10.01 shall not limit any covenant or agreement of the parties that by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective Time. 

  

 10.02 _ Indemnification._ 

  

 (a) Subject to the limitations of Section 10.02(b) hereof, the stockholders of the Company agree, jointly and severally, to indemnify in full Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, stockholders and subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") and hold them harmless from and against any claim, demand, loss, liability, obligation, deficiency, action, damage, expense or cost (including reasonable legal expenses), whether or not actually incurred or paid (collectively " _Losses_ "), which the Indemnified Parties may suffer, sustain or become subject to, prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, as a result of (i) any misrepresentation in any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Letter or closing certificates delivered or to be delivered by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to Sections 7.01(e), 7.02(j)(i) and 7.02(j)(ii) of this Agreement (collectively, the " _Related Documents_ "), (ii) any breach of, or failure to perform, any covenant of the Company contained in this Agreement or any of the Related Documents, or (iii) the amount in excess of the Per Share Amount, if any, paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation to any stockholders of the Company who validly exercised their appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the " _Parent Losses_ "). Subject to Section 10.05 hereof, the indemnification provided by this 

    Section 10.02(a) shall be satisfied, solely and exclusively, from the Escrow
Amount on a pro rata basis in proportion to each stockholder\'s interest in
the total shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Date as set forth on _Exhibit A_ to the Escrow Agreement.

  

 (b) The stockholders of the Company will be liable to the Indemnified Parties for any Parent Loss, and Parent shall be entitled to set off against the Escrow Amount (and, subject to Section 10.05 hereof, only the Escrow Amount) (i) only if Parent delivers to the Stockholders\' Representative a written notice, setting forth in reasonable detail the identity, nature and amount of Parent Losses related to such claim or claims prior to the first anniversary of the Effective Date, (ii) only if the aggregate amount of all Parent Losses exceeds $5,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), in which case the stockholders of the Company shall be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Parties only, subject to Section 10.05 hereof, for the amount of such Parent Losses in excess of the Basket Amount; and (iii), except for fraud or willful misrepresentation, the Company stockholders\' aggregate liability for all amounts under this Section 10.02 shall not exceed an amount equal to the Escrow Amount (the " _Cap_ "); _provided, however,_ that the Basket Amount shall apply only to breaches or misrepresentations of representations and warranties other than those set forth in Section 3.03 hereof and shall _not_ apply to any breaches of any covenants of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in any Related Document. Parent\'s failure to provide the detail required by clause (i) in the preceding sentence shall not constitute either a breach of this Agreement by Parent or any basis for the Stockholders\' Representative to assert that Parent did not comply with the terms of this Section 10.02 sufficient to cause Parent to have waived its rights under this Section 10.02, unless, and only to the extent, such failure has prejudiced the Stockholders\' Representative\'s ability to defend successfully such claim. 

  

 (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this Article X shall be reduced by (i) any related recoveries actually received by the Indemnified Parties under insurance policies, (ii) any other related payments actually received by the Indemnified Parties from third parties and (iii) any Tax benefits actually realized or received by the Indemnified Parties or any of their Affiliates, in each case, on account of the matter resulting in such Losses or the payment of such Losses. 

  

 10.03 _ Method of Asserting Claims._ 

  

 (a) In the event that any of the Indemnified Parties is made a defendant in or party to any action or proceeding, judicial or administrative, instituted by any third party for the liability or the costs or expenses of which are Parent Losses (any such third party action or proceeding being referred to as a " _Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the Stockholders\' Representative prompt notice thereof. The failure to give such notice shall not affect any Indemnified Party\'s ability to seek reimbursement unless such failure has prejudiced the Stockholders\' Representative\'s ability to defend successfully a Claim. The Stockholders\' Representative shall be entitled to contest and defend such Claim; _provided, that_  the Stockholders\' Representative (i) has a reasonable basis for concluding that such defense may be successful and (ii) can diligently contest and defend such Claim. Notice of the intention to so contest and defend shall be given by the Stockholders\' Representative to the Indemnified Party within 20 business days after the Indemnified Party\'s notice of such Claim (but, in all events, at least five business days prior to the date that an answer to such Claim is due to be filed). Such contest and defense shall be conducted by reputable attorneys retained by the Stockholders\' Representative. The Indemnified Party shall be entitled at any time, at its own cost and expense (which expense shall not constitute a Parent Loss unless the Indemnified Party reasonably determines that the Stockholders\' Representative is not adequately representing or, because of a conflict of interest, may not adequately represent, any interests of the Indemnified Parties, and only to the extent that such expenses are reasonable), to participate in such contest and defense and to be represented by reputable attorneys of its or their own choosing. If the Indemnified Party elects to participate in such defense, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with the Stockholders\' Representative in the conduct of such defense. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Stockholders\' Representative to the extent reasonably requested by the 

    Stockholders\' Representative in the contest and defense of such Claim,
including providing reasonable access (upon reasonable notice) to the books,
records and employees of the Indemnified Party if relevant to the defense of
such Claim; _provided that,_ such cooperation shall not unduly disrupt the
operations of the business of the Indemnified Party or cause the Indemnified
Party to waive any statutory or common law privileges, breach any
confidentiality obligations owed to third parties or otherwise cause any trade
secret or confidential information of such Indemnified Party to become
public. Neither the Indemnified Party nor the Stockholders\' Representative
may concede, settle or compromise any Claim without the consent of the
other party, which consents will not be unreasonably withheld.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) if a Claim seeks the issue of an
injunction, the specific performance of an obligation or similar remedy, or
(ii) if the subject matter of a Claim relates to the ongoing business of any
of the Indemnified Parties, which Claim, if decided against any of the
Indemnified Parties, would materially adversely affect the ongoing business
or reputation of any of the Indemnified Parties, then, in each such case, the
Indemnified Parties alone shall be entitled to contest and defend (but not
settle, unless such settlement does not involve the payment of money for which
the stockholders of the Company are responsible hereunder) such Claim in the
first instance and, if the Indemnified Parties do not contest, defend or
settle such Claim, the Stockholders\' Representative shall then have the right
to contest and defend (but not settle) such Claim.

  

 (b) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against the stockholders of the Company that does not involve a Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver a notice of such claim with reasonable promptness to the Stockholder\'s Representative. If the Stockholders\' Representative notifies the Indemnified Party that the stockholders of the Company do not dispute the claim described in such notice or fails to notify the Indemnified Party within 20 business days after delivery of such notice by the Indemnified Party whether the stockholders of the Company dispute the claim described in such notice, the Parent Loss in the amount specified in the Indemnified Party\'s notice will be conclusively deemed a liability of the stockholders of the Company and the stockholders of the Company shall pay (subject to the Basket Amount, to the extent applicable), the amount of such Parent Loss to the Indemnified Party on demand. If the stockholders of the Company have timely disputed their liability with respect to such claim, the Stockholders\' Representative and an officer of Parent will proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute as soon as practicable, and if not resolved through the negotiations of such individuals within 45 days after the delivery of the Indemnified Party\'s notice of such claim, such dispute shall be resolved fully and finally in New York, New York, by an arbitrator selected pursuant to and an arbitration governed by Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as modified herein. The parties will jointly appoint a mutually acceptable independent arbitrator within 30 days, or if the parties are unable to mutually agree upon an arbitrator within such 30 days, will seek assistance in such regard from the American Arbitration Association as soon as practicable. The arbitrator shall resolve the dispute as soon as practicable based on the governing law, without regard to its rules of evidence, and judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Any such judgment against the stockholders shall, subject to Section 10.05 hereof, be settled solely and exclusively from the Escrow Amount. Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders\' Representative on behalf of the stockholders of the Company, on the other, shall bear its own fees and expenses in connection with such arbitration and shall bear 50% of the fees and expenses of the arbitrator. 

   

 10.04 _ Stockholders\' Representative Acknowledgment._ The Stockholders\' Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees, for himself and on behalf of the stockholders of the Company and each of their respective heirs, successors and/or assigns, that, in the event that they become liable pursuant to the terms of this Article X to indemnify any Indemnified Party, they shall have no rights and shall make no claim against the Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any matter which is the subject of or otherwise related to the Parent Loss requiring such indemnification. Parent acknowledges and agrees that, until such time as the stockholders of the Company have become so liable, the Stockholders\' Representative shall retain all rights that he may have to contest or dispute the 

    stockholders\' responsibility to indemnify such Indemnified Party in
accordance with the terms of Section 10.03 hereof.

  

 10.05 _ Sole and Exclusive Remedy._ After the Effective Time, the rights set forth in this Article X shall be each party\'s sole and exclusive remedies against the other parties hereto for misrepresentations or breaches of covenants contained in this Agreement and the Related Documents. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent any of the parties hereto from bringing an action based upon allegations of fraud or other intentional breach of an obligation of or with respect to the other parties in connection with this Agreement and the Related Documents. In the event such action is brought, Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders\' Representative on his and on the other Company stockholders\' behalf on the other, shall bear its own fees and expenses in connection with such action. 

  

 10.06 _ Treatment of Indemnification Payments._ All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall, to the extent permitted by law, be treated by the parties hereto as an adjustment to the Merger consideration. 

   
 

ARTICLE XI 
MISCELLANEOUS

  

 11.01 _ Press Releases and Announcements._ Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agree that the existence, nature and terms and conditions of this Agreement and discussions between the parties regarding the transactions contemplated hereby are, and shall be treated as, confidential by the parties. Accordingly, each party agrees that it (a) will make no public comment concerning or announcement of the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) will respond to all inquiries concerning the transactions contemplated hereby by stating that it is such company\'s policy not to comment on such inquiries; (c) will take reasonable steps to restrict knowledge of the transactions contemplated hereby to those who need to know; and (d) will notify the other parties of any rumor external to the parties of the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent, as a public company, is subject to certain disclosure requirements under applicable securities laws. For this reason, Parent reserves the right to disclose the existence of and the status and terms of negotiations at any time it decides that securities laws or the rules of any stock exchange on which its shares are traded require such disclosure, and Parent shall have the right to issue a press release regarding the transactions contemplated hereby upon the signing of this Agreement and upon the Closing; _provided that,_ Parent agrees to notify the Company if Parent intends to make a disclosure prior to Closing and, to the extent feasible, to provide the Company with the text of the disclosure and opportunity to comment in advance of its release to the public.

 11.03 _ Amendment and Waiver._ This Agreement may not be amended or waived except in a writing executed by the party against which such amendment or waiver is sought to be enforced; _provided, however,_ that after any required approval of matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, there shall not be made any amendment that by law requires further approval by such stockholders without obtaining such further approval. No course of dealing between or among any persons having any interest in this Agreement will be deemed effective to 

    modify or amend any part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of
any person under or by reason of this Agreement.
