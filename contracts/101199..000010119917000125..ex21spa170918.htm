other proceeding would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to

letter that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect such

that, as a result of the execution of this Agreement or any of the other

pay or any increase in severance pay of any Business Employee, (ii) accelerate

result in the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of the assets of the
Business, or (iv) result in any payment (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) to any Business Employee who is a "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that could reasonably be construed, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No Business Employee is entitled to receive
any additional payment (including any tax gross-up or other payment) from
Sellers or its Affiliates as a result of the imposition of the excise Taxes
required by Section 4999 of the Code or any Taxes required by Section 409A of

bargaining unit in the Business or of any Business Employee.

regarding any material charge or complaint, any pending or threatened material
complaint, or the intent to conduct a material investigation (or written
notice that such an investigation is in progress). As of the date of this
Agreement, there is no material Action pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened before any Governmental Authority by or on behalf of any present or
former Business Employee or any applicant for employment as a Business
Employee, in each case alleging breach of any express or implied contract of
employment, any applicable Law governing employment or the termination thereof
or other discriminatory, wrongful or tortious conduct in connection with the
employment relationship, in each case that has not been resolved as of the

Insurance Contract as a "modified endowment contract" and has not acted to
revoke such consent.

(d) Each Insurance Contract that is subject to Section 817 of the Code
complies with, and, at all times since issuance, has complied with, the
diversification requirements applicable thereto, and the Company is treated,
for federal Tax purposes, as the owner of the assets underlying such Insurance
Contract.

discussions or negotiations with the IRS or any other Governmental Authority,
or otherwise has requested relief from the IRS, regarding any Insurance
Contract to meet the requirements of applicable Law, including Sections 72,

Insurance Contracts or any plan or arrangement in connection with which such
Insurance Contracts were purchased or have been administered.

SUCH RESPECTIVE ENTITY SET FORTH BY APPLICABLE LAW (INCLUDING THE LAWS OF ITS
JURISDICTION OF FORMATION) IN EFFECT AS OF THE DATE HEREOF IN ORDER FOR THE
GOVERNMENTAL APPROVALS LISTED IN SCHEDULE 11.01(B) AND SCHEDULE 11.02(B) TO BE
OBTAINED, AND (B) THERE ARE NO FACTS, EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AS OF
THE DATE HEREOF, INVOLVING OR RELATING TO BUYER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES, THAT
MAY PREVENT OR MATERIALLY DELAY THE GRANTING OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENTAL

Section 6.10 Equity Financing.

(a) Buyer has delivered to Seller and the Company a true and complete copy of
the Equity Commitment Letter, among Buyer and Sponsor, relating to Sponsor's
commitment, subject to the terms and conditions thereof, to invest directly or
indirectly the amounts set forth therein on the date on which the Closing
should occur pursuant to the terms hereof and to which Seller is an express
third party beneficiary with the rights set forth therein (the "Equity
Financing"). (b) Assuming the Equity Financing is funded in accordance with the Equity
Commitment Letter and performance in all material respects by Seller of its
obligations under this Agreement, the amount of the commitments under the
Equity Commitment Letter is sufficient and the aggregate net proceeds from the
Equity Financing when funded in accordance with the Equity Commitment Letter,
together with other funds available to Buyer, are sufficient and will be
sufficient to fund all amounts required to be paid by Buyer on the Closing
Date, including the payment of the Purchase Price, in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

(c) The Equity Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and has not been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded or otherwise amended, supplemented or
modified (or contemplated to be amended, supplemented or modified) in any
respect. The Equity Commitment Letter, in the form delivered to Seller, is a
legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and Sponsor, enforceable against
such parties in accordance with its terms, except as the same may be limited
by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
Laws of general application relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to
general equity principles. There are no side letters or other contracts or
arrangements relating to the Equity Financing. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Buyer under any term, or a failure of any condition, of
the Equity Commitment Letter or otherwise result in any portion of the Equity
Financing contemplated thereby being unavailable on the date on which the
Closing should occur pursuant to the terms hereof. Assuming the performance in
all material respects by Seller of its obligations under this Agreement and
satisfaction of the closing conditions set forth in Section 11.02, Buyer has
no reason to believe that it or Sponsor would be unable to satisfy on a timely
basis any term or condition of the Equity Commitment Letter required to be
satisfied by it. No commitment fees or other fees are required to be paid to
Sponsor under the Equity Commitment Letter. There are no conditions precedent
or other contingencies related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Equity Financing, other than as expressly set forth in
the Equity Commitment Letter.

OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO BUYER OR
ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES OR INVESTORS, AND BUYER DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, FORECASTS, PROJECTIONS, STATEMENTS OR

privilege or similar doctrine or (B) contravene any applicable Law,
Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty, it being understood that Seller
shall (x) cooperate with any requests for, and use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain any waivers and (y) use its reasonable best efforts to make other
arrangements (including redacting information or entering into joint defense
agreements), in each case, that would enable any otherwise required disclosure

(a) Each of Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause each of its applicable
Affiliates to, (i) as soon as reasonably practicable following the date hereof
(and, in the case of such filings, applications and notifications, in no event

applications and notifications with each Governmental Authority (including a
"Form A" Acquisition of Control Statement to be filed with the Insurance
Commissioner of the State of Iowa in substantially the form that has been
provided by Buyer to Seller prior to the date hereof (with the remaining

case, that may be or become necessary for their respective execution and
delivery of, and the performance of their respective obligations pursuant to,
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, the Transaction
Agreements and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to (A) prevent the initiation
of, and defend any Action challenging this Agreement or any other Transaction

thereby, (B) promptly provide to a Governmental Authority any non-privileged
information and documents requested by such Governmental Authority or that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and (C) avoid the entry of, or
cause to be lifted or rescinded, any Governmental Order adversely affecting
the ability of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements. The parties shall cooperate
with the reasonable requests of each other in promptly seeking to obtain all
such authorizations, consents, orders and approvals. Neither Seller nor Buyer
shall take any action that they should be reasonably aware would have the
effect of materially delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of the
Governmental Approvals listed in Schedule 11.01(b) and Schedule 11.02(b).

(b) In furtherance of and not in limitation of the foregoing, subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer and Seller shall, and shall
cause their applicable Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to (i)
comply with any conditions imposed by any Governmental Authority to its
approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, (ii) prevent the enactment, entry, enforcement or
promulgation of any applicable Law restraining or prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement or (iii)
cause to be vacated, modified or suspended any injunction or order that would
make the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any other Transaction Agreement in accordance with its terms unlawful or that
would prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement, subject, in
each case, to Section 7.03(d).

(c) Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify one another of any communication it
receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement and permit the other party to review in advance any
proposed communication by such party to any Governmental Authority and shall
provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between such party or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other
hand; provided, that no party shall be required to disclose to the other any
of its or its Affiliates' confidential competitive information or any personal
identifiable information of their respective officers, directors or other individuals. Except as otherwise required or requested by the applicable
Governmental Authority, neither Seller nor Buyer shall agree to participate in
any meeting with any Governmental Authority (other than a telephone call
initiated by such Governmental Authority and not scheduled in advance or
ministerial telephone calls not expected to invoke a substantive discussion of
the transactions contemplated hereunder or under the other Transaction
Agreements) in respect of any such filings, investigation or other inquiry
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement and Section 7.02, Seller and Buyer shall coordinate
and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and
providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing; provided, that neither party shall be required
to disclose to the other any of its or its Affiliates' confidential
competitive information or any personally identifiable information of their
respective officers, directors or other applicable individuals. Neither party
shall be required to comply with any provision of this Section 7.03(c) to the
extent that such compliance would be prohibited by applicable Law.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer shall not be
obligated to take or refrain from taking or to agree to it or its Affiliates
(or the Company) taking or refraining from taking, any action, or to permit to
exist any restriction, condition, limitation or requirement which,
individually or together with all other such actions, restrictions,
conditions, limitations or requirements imposed by Governmental Authorities in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other
Transaction Agreement, would or would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on Buyer (any such
actions, restrictions, conditions, limitations or requirements, a "Burdensome
Condition"). Without the prior written consent of Buyer, Seller shall not, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to, take or refrain from or to agree to the
taking or refraining from any action or to permit or suffer to exist any
restriction, condition, limitation or requirement that would or would
reasonably be expected to result, individually or in the aggregate, in a
Burdensome Condition being imposed by a Governmental Authority.

(e) Third-Party Consents.

(i) Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise agreed by the parties, the
parties shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to make or obtain the
Third-Party Consents required for the consummation of the transactions

Reinsurance Agreement), including those Third-Party Consents set forth in
Schedule 7.03(e). The aggregate costs associated with obtaining such Third-
Party Consents or obtaining rights to replace any relevant assets or rights or
required to separate any Shared Contracts pursuant to Section 7.4(a) shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Seller;
provided, however, that neither party shall be required to compromise any
right, asset or benefit or incur any Liabilities (other than costs and
expenses) or commence or participate in any Action in order to obtain such
Third-Party Consents. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that any
license fees or similar fees and expenses associated with new software
licenses or services required to be obtained from a third party for the Business shall be borne one hundred
percent (100%) by Buyer, and such fees and expenses shall not be considered to
be costs associated with obtaining Third-Party Consents or obtaining rights to
replace any relevant assets or rights or required to separate any Shared
Contracts pursuant to Section 7.4(a).

(ii) From and after the Closing Date through the first anniversary of the
Closing Date, the parties shall continue to use their reasonable best efforts,
with Buyer's cooperation and at Buyer's sole expense, to obtain, as promptly
as practicable, any such required Third-Party Consents that have not been
obtained as of the Closing Date; provided, however, that neither party shall
be required to compromise any right, asset or benefit or incur any Liabilities
(other than costs and expenses) or commence or participate in any Action in
order to obtain such Third-Party Consents.

(iii) Until such time as each Third-Party Consent is obtained, Seller shall,
and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to
cooperate with Buyer in any lawful and economically feasible arrangement to
provide that the Company shall receive the benefits associated with the
applicable Material Contract or Reinsurance Agreement. Such arrangement may
include performance by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller as agent, providing
transition services under the Transition Services Agreement or subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing to Buyer, or Seller or its Affiliates enforcing for
the benefit (and at the expense) of Buyer any and all of its respective rights
against any non-affiliated third party associated with the applicable Material
Contract or Reinsurance Agreement, and paying or causing its Affiliates to
pay, to Buyer when received all monies received by Seller or its Affiliates in
connection with the applicable Material Contract or Reinsurance Agreement.

(a) Subject to the cost allocation provision set forth in Section 7.03(e)(i),
from and after the date of this Agreement and through the second anniversary
of the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts with Buyer's cooperation, to the extent reasonably
requested by Buyer, to cause the counterparty to any Shared Contract to enter
into a new agreement, on substantially the same terms and conditions as those
set forth in the Shared Contract, with Buyer or the Company with respect to
the matters addressed by such Shared Contract that are related to the
Business; provided, that Seller shall not be required to compromise any right,
asset or benefit or expend any amount or incur any Liabilities or provide any
other consideration in connection therewith.

(b) Until such time as each Shared Contract identified in clause (a) is
replicated, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Buyer in any lawful and economically
feasible arrangement to provide that the Company shall receive the benefits
under any such Shared Contract allocated to the Company, including performance
by Seller or an Affiliate of Seller as agent, provided that the Company shall
undertake to pay or satisfy the corresponding liabilities for the enjoyment of
such benefit to the extent they would have been responsible therefor if such
Shared Contract had been replicated. Section 7.05 Intercompany Obligations. EXCEPT FOR (A) THE INTERCOMPANY

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to, preserve, in accordance with
and until such date as may be required by, Buyer's, or its applicable
Affiliates' standard document retention policies (but for not less than six
(6) years from the Closing Date or such later date as may be required by
applicable Law), all pre-Closing Date records related to the Company possessed
or controlled by such Person. During such period, upon any reasonable request
from Seller or its Representatives, Buyer or any of its Affiliates holding
such records shall (i) provide to Seller or its Representatives reasonable
access to such records during normal business hours; provided, that such
access shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
Buyer or its Affiliates holding such records and (ii) permit Seller to make
copies of such records, in each case subject to reasonable prior notice in
writing and at Seller's sole cost and expense. Nothing herein shall require
Buyer or its Affiliates to disclose any information to Seller if such
disclosure would, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or any other legal
privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any applicable Law, Governmental
Order or any fiduciary duty (it being understood that Buyer and its Affiliates
shall cooperate in good faith in requesting waivers that would enable
otherwise required disclosure to Seller or its Representatives to occur
without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such applicable Law,
Governmental Order or fiduciary duty or agreement) or (except as provided in Section 10.04)
require Buyer or its Affiliates to disclose its Tax records (except for Tax
records of, or with respect to, the Company) or any personnel or related
records. Such records may be requested under this Section 8.01 for any
reasonable purpose, including to the extent reasonably required in connection
with accounting, litigation, financial reporting, federal securities
disclosure, compliance with contractual obligations of Seller or its
Affiliates or other similar purpose. Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the
expiration of such retention period, any and all such records may be destroyed
by Buyer if Buyer sends to Seller written notice of its intent to destroy such
records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the records to be
destroyed; such records may then be destroyed after the sixtieth (60th) day
following such notice unless Seller notifies Buyer that Seller desires to
obtain possession of such records, in which event Buyer shall transfer the
records to Seller and Seller shall pay all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
of Buyer in connection therewith.

Section 8.02 Books and Records.

(a) At the Closing, (i) all books and records of the Company and the Business

requested by Buyer, all original corporate records of the Company relating to
the legal existence, ownership and corporate governance of the Company and all
Permits of the Company, in each case possessed or controlled by Seller or its
Affiliates and that are not otherwise possessed or controlled by the Company.

develop and implement a plan that will result in the delivery or transfer of
all other books and records of the Company and the Business to Buyer or the
Company at, or as soon as reasonably practicable following, the Closing.

preserve, in accordance with Seller's, or its applicable Affiliates', standard
document retention policies and until such date as such books and records are

the Company and the Business that have not been transferred to Buyer. During
such period, upon any request from Buyer or its Representatives, Seller or any
of its Affiliates holding such records shall (i) provide to Buyer or its
Representatives reasonable access to such records during normal business
hours; provided, that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of Seller or its Affiliates holding such records and
(ii) permit Buyer to make copies of such records, in each case subject to
prior notice in writing and at Buyer's sole cost and expense. Nothing herein
shall require Seller or its Affiliates to disclose any information to Buyer if
such disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work
product immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine, obligation
of confidentiality or non-disclosure, or contravene any applicable Law,
Governmental Order or any fiduciary duty (it being understood that Seller and
its Affiliates shall cooperate in good faith in requesting waivers that would
enable otherwise required disclosure to Buyer or its Representatives to occur
without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening such applicable Law,
Governmental Order or fiduciary duty or agreement) or (except as provided in Section 10.04) require Seller or its
Affiliates to disclose its Tax records (except for Tax records of, or with
respect to, the Company) or any personnel or related records. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if at any time Seller proposes to destroy any books and records
retained by Seller or its Affiliates that are related to the Business, Seller
shall send Buyer written notice of its intent to destroy such books and
records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the books and records
to be destroyed. Seller may destroy such books and records only after the

Buyer desires to obtain possession of such books and records, in which event
Seller shall transfer the books and records to Buyer.

under the Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate; provided, that Seller's
and its Affiliates' remedies with respect to breaches of such Confidentiality
Agreement that occurred prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing. If for
any reason the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

becomes available to such party on a non-confidential basis and from a source
(other than a party to this Agreement or any Affiliate or Representative of
such party) that is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with respect to
such information. Each of the parties hereto shall instruct its Affiliates and
Representatives having access to such information of such confidentiality
obligations.

Section 8.04 Insurance. (a) Except as expressly provided in Section 8.04(b), effective at the time of
the Closing, the Company shall cease to be insured by any insurance policies
of Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Company).

(b) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Company or the
Business that occurred or existed prior to the Closing Date that are covered
by occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies and any workers'
compensation insurance policies that apply to the locations at which the
businesses of the Company operate, the Company may make claims under such
policies and programs; provided, that by making any such claims, Buyer agrees
to reimburse Seller for any increased costs incurred by Seller or its
Affiliates as a result of such claims, including any retroactive or
prospective premium adjustments associated with such coverage, as such amounts
are reasonably determined in accordance with those policies and programs
generally applicable from time to time to Seller and its Affiliates; provided,
further, that the Company shall not be permitted to make any such claims if,
and to the extent that, such claims are covered by insurance policies
sponsored by Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the
Company). As of the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, (i) the
Company shall no longer have access to such occurrence-based third-party
liability insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates and (ii) Buyer shall
release Seller and its Affiliates from, any obligation to make such
occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies available to the
Company for claims, known or unknown, resulting from occurrences prior to the
Closing Date (except to the extent of any such claims made prior to such
second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date). Any proceeds received by Seller
or any of its Affiliates after the Closing for third-party claims under
occurrence-based third-party liability insurance policies or workers'
compensation insurance policies with respect to Losses occurring prior to the
Accounts Date in respect of the Company shall be for the benefit of Buyer
unless such proceeds relate to expenditures that have been made prior to the
Effective Time or any business interruption prior to the Accounts Date.

Section 8.05 Trade Names and Trademarks

(a) Other than as contemplated in the Transaction Agreements, Buyer is not
purchasing, acquiring or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in
or to any Intellectual Property owned by Seller or its Affiliates (other than
the Company), including the name "United Fire Group," "UFG," the interlocking
U logo or any Trademark or Internet domain name related thereto or employing
the words "United Fire Group," "UFG," the interlocking U logo or any variation
of the foregoing or any confusingly similar Trademark or Internet domain name,
(including in any and all goodwill, registrations and applications relating
thereto) (collectively, the "Seller Names and Marks"), and, except as
otherwise expressly provided in any Transaction Agreement, neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) shall have
any rights in the Seller Names and Marks and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company) shall contest the
ownership or validity of any rights of Seller or any of its Affiliates in or
to the Seller Names and Marks. Buyer hereby consents to Seller causing the
Company to transfer all rights, title and interests in and to the Seller Names
and Marks to Seller or any of its Affiliates prior to the Closing, and such
transfer(s) shall not constitute a breach of any term or condition of this (b) Except as otherwise provided in any Transaction Agreement, or in
connection with historical, tax, employment or similar references to the
Business, or for purposes of prospectus, capital raising or other financing
transactions and similar disclosures as are necessary and appropriate to
describe the historical relations of the Company and Seller and its Affiliates
or as otherwise required by Law, following the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company) shall cease and discontinue all uses of the
Seller Names and Marks, either alone or in combination with other words and
all Trademarks or Internet domain names confusingly similar to any of the
foregoing or embodying any of the foregoing alone or in combination with other
words. The rights of the Company to the Seller Names and Marks pursuant to the
terms of any existing trademark agreements shall terminate on the Closing
Date.

(c) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that other users
of the Seller Names and Marks operating under the authority and control of the
Company, whose rights terminate upon the Closing pursuant to this Section
8.05, shall cease use of the Seller Names and Marks, except as expressly
authorized thereafter by Seller. After the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Company) shall not expressly, or by implication, do
business as or represent themselves as Seller or an Affiliate of Seller.

(d) In the event Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer (including the Company after
the Closing) materially violates any of its obligations under this Section
8.05, Seller and its Affiliates may proceed against Buyer or its Affiliates in
law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate. A material violation of this Section 8.05 may cause Seller and
its Affiliates irreparable harm, which may not be adequately compensated for
by money damages. In the event of any actual material violation of this
Section 8.05, Seller and any of its Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition
to other remedies that they may have, to seek a temporary restraining order
and to seek preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer or such
Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this Section 8.05 without the
necessity of posting a bond.

(e) From the Closing until the tenth (10th) anniversary of Closing, Seller
shall not, directly or indirectly, use or do Competing Business, or allow any
Affiliate to use or do Competing Business, or assist any Person in using or
doing Competing Business, under the name and mark "United Life" (or any other
name or mark confusingly similar to such name and mark when used in connection
with a Competing Business).

AGREED TO THE FORM OF TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS ATTACHED AS EXHIBITS A, B, C AND

EXTENT SUCH CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A BURDENSOME CONDITION.

Section 8.07 Non-Solicitation.

(a) For a period of twenty-four (24) months from the Closing Date, Seller
shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without the prior written
consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment, employ,

Business Employee who is not an Excluded Employee; provided, that Seller and
its Affiliates may solicit, employ, engage in an independent contractor
relationship or otherwise hire any such Person who was terminated or otherwise
discharged by the Company at least three (3) months prior to the first such
solicitation for employment; provided, further, that nothing in this Section
8.07(a) shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates from employing or

(3) months having passed prior to the first such solicitation or employment;
provided, further, that nothing in this Section 8.07(b) shall prohibit Buyer
or any of its Affiliates from employing or hiring any Person who contacts

shall not include any Person that purchases or receives assets, operations or
a business from Seller or any of its Affiliates, if such Person is not an
Affiliate of Seller after such transaction is consummated. (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Section 8.08(b), and
without implication that the following activities otherwise would be subject

HEREOF, BUT NO LATER THAN THE CLOSING DATE, SELLER AND BUYER SHALL DEVELOP A
WRITTEN PLAN WHEREBY SELLER RETAINS ALL HARDWARE AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR ITS IT
SYSTEMS AND WHICH SETS FORTH STEPS REASONABLY REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ORDERLY,
LOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SEPARATION OF SELLER'S IT SYSTEMS FROM THE COMPANY'S IT
SYSTEMS (THE "IT SYSTEM SEPARATION PLAN"). FOR CLARITY, THE IT SYSTEMS
SEPARATION PLAN SHALL SEPARATE THE COMPANY'S IT SYSTEMS FROM SELLER'S IT

THE ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS OF THE COMPANY, AS IN EFFECT IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO
THE CLOSING, WITH RESPECT TO ALL PAST DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND MANAGERS OF THE
COMPANY AS WELL AS ALL DIRECTORS, OFFICERS AND MANAGERS OF THE COMPANY AS OF

REQUESTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH. Section 8.11 Transition Plan. PROMPTLY AFTER THE DATE HEREOF, AND IN ANY EVENT
WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS HEREAFTER, SELLER AND BUYER SHALL EACH APPOINT A
TRANSITION TEAM TO:

separation plan for separating the Business from the retained businesses of
Seller and Seller's Affiliates (other than the Company) so as to minimize the
adverse impact of such separation on each party's businesses;

(b) identify the costs relating to separation and transition (including Third-
Party Consents to provide services under the Transaction Agreements); and

(c) review, revise and update, where appropriate, the schedules to the
Transition Services Agreement between the date hereof and Closing and any such

corresponding schedules attached to the form of Transition Services Agreement.

Section 8.12 Deletion of Software. IN THE EVENT THAT AFTER THE CLOSING EITHER
BUYER OR SELLER BECOMES AWARE OF ANY INSTANCE OF ANY SOFTWARE IN ITS
RESPECTIVE POSSESSION THAT (A) IN THE CASE OF BUYER IS OWNED AFTER THE CLOSING

AVAILABLE TO BUYER OR THE COMPANY UNDER A TRANSACTION AGREEMENT (INCLUDING ON
A PASS-THROUGH BASIS PENDING RECEIPT OF A THIRD-PARTY CONSENT OR UNDER A
SHARED CONTRACT PENDING REPLICATION) OR (B) IN THE CASE OF SELLER IS OTHERWISE
OWNED BY THE COMPANY, IN EACH CASE, THAT IS NOT LICENSED TO SELLER OR ANY OF
SELLER'S AFFILIATES, BUYER, IN THE CASE OF CLAUSE (A) AND SELLER, IN THE CASE
OF CLAUSE (B), SHALL USE THEIR RESPECTIVE REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS TO DELETE
SUCH INSTANCES OF SUCH SOFTWARE AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE.

Section 8.13 Further Action.

(a) Seller and Buyer (i) shall execute and deliver, or shall cause to be
executed and delivered, such documents and other papers and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts (subject to Section 7.03(d)) to take, or
cause to be taken, such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry
out the provisions of the Transaction Agreements and give effect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, (ii) shall refrain
from taking any actions that could reasonably be expected to materially
impair, delay or impede the Closing, (iii) without limiting the foregoing, but

consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be met as soon
as reasonably practicable and (iv) shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate
an orderly Closing and transition.

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall keep each other reasonably apprised of the
status of the matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including with respect to the satisfaction of the

cause to be done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the
Equity Financing, including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Commitment
Letter, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to ensure the accuracy of all
representations and warranties of Buyer, if any, set forth in the Equity

Letter without the prior written consent of Seller. Buyer agrees to notify
Seller promptly, and in any event within one Business Day, if at any time
prior to the Closing Date (i) the Equity Commitment Letter expires or is
terminated for any reason (or if any Person attempts or purports to terminate
the Equity Commitment Letter, whether or not such attempted or purported
termination is valid) or (ii) Sponsor refuses to provide the full Equity
Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter.

(c) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that neither the obtaining of the Equity

INFORMATION (FINANCIAL OR OTHERWISE) RELATING TO THE COMPANY AND ITS BUSINESS
TO, AND COOPERATE WITH DUE DILIGENCE INVESTIGATION BY, POTENTIAL LENDERS
PROPOSING TO EXTEND A LOAN TO BUYER OR ITS AFFILIATES (TO THE EXTENT
REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY AND NOT UNREASONABLY INTERFERING WITH THE BUSINESS OR
OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY, SELLER OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES AND IN NO EVENT
SHALL SELLER OR THE COMPANY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE ANY INFORMATION THAT WAS
NOT OF THE TYPE ALREADY PROVIDED TO BUYER) AND (B) PROVIDE REASONABLE AND CUSTOMARY COOPERATION WITH THE MARKETING
EFFORTS FOR ANY PART OF SUCH LOAN, IN EACH CASE, AT BUYER'S SOLE COST AND

ARTICLE IX 
EMPLOYEE MATTERS

Section 9.01 Employee Matters.

(a) Comparable Position. Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, Seller shall (i) update Schedule 1.01(a) to add any individuals who
become Business Employees after the date hereof and remove any individuals who
have ceased to be Business Employees after the date hereof and (ii) deliver
such updated list of Business Employees to Buyer. On or prior to the
Employment Offer Date, or, if later, within thirty (30) days after the date
Seller provides notice to Buyer that an individual has become a Business
Employee (but not later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date), Buyer
shall extend or shall cause one of its Affiliates to extend to each Business
Employee a written offer of employment, effective as of the Closing Date (or
such later date as is set forth below with respect to those Business Employees
employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates who are Inactive Business
Employees), that constitutes a Comparable Position with Buyer or its
Affiliates (an "Offer of Employment"). The form of Offer of Employment shall be provided to Seller within a reasonable period prior to being made to
the applicable Business Employee in order to provide Seller with a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment, and shall set forth the position, duties,
responsibilities, compensation and principal place of employment each such
Business Employee will have with Buyer or its Affiliates following the
Business Employee's Effective Hire Date. Except as set forth below with
respect to Inactive Business Employees, the employment relationship of each
Business Employee who is not an Excluded Employee with Seller or its
applicable Affiliate shall terminate effective as of 11:59 p.m., Central time,
on the Closing Date. Each Business Employee employed by Buyer or one of its
Affiliates (including the Company) following the Closing Date shall be
referred to herein as a "Transferred Employee." A Business Employee who
performs work at his or her then applicable place of employment on the first
(1st) Business Day following the Closing Date on which such Business Employee
is scheduled, expected or permitted to work (as applicable) shall be deemed to
have accepted Buyer's Offer of Employment and shall be considered a
Transferred Employee as of the Effective Hire Date for all purposes of this
Agreement. Inactive Business Employees shall remain employed by Seller or
Seller's Affiliate, as the case may be, until the earlier of the date the
Inactive Business Employee returns to active employment, or the expiration of
the Inactive Business Employee's leave under Seller's or such applicable
Affiliate's policies, so long as such return to work occurs within six (6)
months following the Closing Date; such Inactive Business Employee shall
become a Transferred Employee on the first (1st) Business Day following the
Inactive Business Employee's return to work from the leave. The date on which
a Business Employee commences employment with Buyer or its Affiliates shall be
referred to as the "Effective Hire Date," which means (A) 12:00:01 a.m.,
Central time, on the first (1st) day immediately following the Closing Date
for all Business Employees other than Inactive Business Employees and (B) for
any Inactive Business Employees, the first (1st) Business Day following an
Inactive Business Employee's return to work from the leave.

(b) Employee Communications. During the period from the date hereof through
the Closing Date, Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate to communicate
to the Business Employees the details of the proposed terms and conditions of
their employment with Buyer or its Affiliates. All communications between
Buyer or its Affiliates and the Business Employees shall be subject to the
reasonable prior approval of each of Buyer and Seller.

(c) Maintenance of Terms; WARN Act. From a Transferred Employee's Effective
Hire Date through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date or such
earlier date on which such Transferred Employee's employment with Buyer and
its Affiliates terminates, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to,
provide such Transferred Employee with terms and conditions of employment that
constitute a Comparable Position. On and during the ninety (90) days following
the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall ensure that its Affiliates do
not, take, cause or permit any act or omission that would or reasonably could
constitute a "plant closing," "mass layoff" or similar event under the WARN
Act with respect to any Transferred Employees. Thereafter, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, comply with the WARN Act so as to
avoid any liability thereunder for Seller or its Affiliates with respect to
any Transferred Employee.

(d) Work Permits. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably cooperate with respect to
the transfer or sponsorship of work permits for all Transferred Employees who
are foreign nationals. (e) Employee Benefits. Buyer and its Affiliates shall waive, or shall cause to
be waived, any waiting period, probationary period, pre-existing condition
exclusion, evidence of insurability requirement, or similar condition with
respect to initial participation under any plan, program, or arrangement
established, maintained, or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
to provide health insurance, life insurance, or disability benefits with
respect to each Transferred Employee who has, prior to the Effective Hire
Date, satisfied, under Seller's or its Affiliates' comparable plans, the
comparable eligibility, insurability or other requirements referred to in this
sentence. Buyer and its Affiliates shall recognize, or cause to be recognized,
the dollar amount of all co-insurance, deductibles and similar expenses
incurred by each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible dependents)
during the calendar year in which the Effective Hire Date occurs (or, if
later, the year in which the Transferred Employee commences participation in a
plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates) for purposes of satisfying such
year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which each Transferred Employee will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Hire Date, subject to such
Transferred Employee's provision of relevant information or documentation
confirming the amount of such co-insurance, deductibles and similar expenses.
Each Transferred Employee shall, for purposes of determining such Transferred
Employee's eligibility to participate in and vesting under all employee
benefit plans, programs and arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates in which
they can become eligible to participate in following the Closing Date, be
credited with the service of such Transferred Employee credited by Seller or
its Affiliates or entities that become Seller's Affiliates up to the Effective
Hire Date, to the same extent as if such service had been performed for Buyer
or any of its Affiliates; provided, that such service shall also be credited
for purposes of calculating the benefit accrual for paid time off and
severance pay. In addition to the foregoing, Buyer shall, or shall cause one
or more of its Affiliates to:

(i) from the Closing Date to the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date,
provide Transferred Employees with the greater of (A) the severance payments
and benefits to which the Transferred Employee would be entitled under the
Seller Severance Plan and (B) the severance payments and benefits provided by
Buyer or its Affiliates to its similarly-situated employees at such time,
taking into account the Transferred Employee's length of service with Seller
and its Affiliates as provided in this Section 9.01(e) in addition to service
with Buyer and its Affiliates;

(ii) cause the defined contribution plan(s) maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates to accept a direct rollover of the account (including earnings
thereon through the date of transfer and any promissory note evidencing an
outstanding loan) of any Transferred Employee in the investment and savings
plan of Seller or Seller's Affiliate or any other Tax-qualified retirement
plan of Seller or Seller's Affiliate, that a Transferred Employee elects to
make as a direct rollover, and, to the extent necessary, amend such defined
contribution plan(s) prior to the Closing in order to carry out the intent of
this Section 9.01(e)(ii);

(iii) cause the flexible spending account(s) maintained by Buyer or Buyer's
Affiliates to accept a transfer of the account(s) of any Transferred Employee
under a health or dependent care flexible spending account maintained by
Seller or Seller's Affiliate (each, a "Seller FSA") and in doing so (A)
effectuate the election of any such Transferred Employee as in effect under the applicable Seller FSA immediately prior to the
Closing and (B) assume responsibility for administering and paying under the
applicable plans of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliate all eligible reimbursement
claims of the Transferred Employees incurred in the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs and submitted for payment on or after the Closing Date,
whether such claims arose before, on or after the Closing Date. As soon as
practicable following the Closing Date, Seller or Seller's Affiliate shall
cause to be transferred to Buyer, if applicable, an amount in cash equal to
(I) the sum of all contributions to any Seller FSA made with respect to the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs prior to the Closing Date by or on
behalf of the Transferred Employees, reduced by (II) the sum of all claims
incurred by the Transferred Employees during the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs and submitted for payment prior to the Closing Date under
any Seller FSA (or if the amount in clause (II) exceeds the amount in clause
(I), Buyer shall transfer such amount to Seller);

(iv) provide each Transferred Employee with unpaid time off in an amount equal
to the unused paid time off accrued by such Transferred Employee as of such
Transferred Employee's Effective Hire Date;

(v) from the Closing Date through the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing
Date, provide Transferred Employees with the greater of (A) the vacation and
paid time off accrual rate and maximum accrual the Transferred Employee would
have been eligible to receive under the applicable plan, policy or agreement
of Seller or its Affiliates covering the Transferred Employee immediately
prior to the Effective Hire Date and (B) the vacation and paid time off
accrual rate and maximum accrual provided by Buyer or its Affiliates to its
similarly-situated employees; provided, that such vacation and paid time off
accrual rate and maximum accrual shall not be decreased as a result of the
obligation set forth in Section 9.01(e)(iv); and

(vi) reimburse Transferred Employees for education courses for which such
Transferred Employees registered prior to the Effective Hire Date; provided,
that Transferred Employees have not already been reimbursed therefor, to the
extent that Seller's or its Affiliates' policies would provide for such
reimbursement if such Transferred Employees had continued to be employed by
Seller or its Affiliate.

(f) Annual Incentive Bonus. Seller shall, or shall cause one or more of its
Affiliates to, pay the bonuses for the 2017 year under the Seller Annual
Incentive Plan to Transferred Employees who were covered under that plan
immediately prior to the Closing and who (i) continue to be employed by Buyer
or its Affiliates as of the applicable payment date (determined in accordance
with Seller's historical practices and the Seller Annual Incentive Plan), or
(ii) whose employment with Buyer or its Affiliates is involuntarily terminated
(other than for cause) by Buyer or such Affiliate prior to such payment date.
The amount of each Transferred Employee's bonus shall be determined by
application of the nondiscretionary, formulaic provisions of the Seller Annual
Incentive Bonus Plan applicable to such Transferred Employee (each such bonus,
an "Individual Bonus"). The aggregate amount to be so paid by Seller or its
Affiliates to all such Transferred Employees (the "2017 Bonus Pool") shall be
an amount equal to the sum of all the Individual Bonuses. In the event that the Closing Date occurs prior to January 1, 2018
and the payment of individual bonuses by Seller and its Affiliates, Buyer or
its Affiliates shall reimburse Seller in an amount equal to the 2017 Bonus
Pool multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days
from the Closing Date through December 31, 2017 and the denominator of which
is 365. Individual Bonuses shall be distributed by Seller or its Affiliates
among such Transferred Employees. Buyer or its Affiliates shall implement an
incentive bonus plan for the 2018 year that is substantially comparable to the
Seller Annual Incentive Plan and shall bear all cost and Liabilities
thereunder.

(g) Long-Term Incentive Compensation. To the extent that any Transferred
Employee was granted equity incentives under the Seller Long-Term Incentive
Plan in the grant cycle ending immediately prior to the date hereof (a
"Transferred Employee Equity Recipient"), then, for the long-term incentive
grant cycle of Buyer for similarly situated employees occurring during the
period ending on the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing, Buyer shall, or
shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to, grant to each Transferred
Employee Equity Recipient a long-term incentive award having a value (as
reasonably determined in good faith by Buyer) equal to or greater than the
value to such Transferred Employee Equity Recipient of the most recent grant
under the Seller Long-Term Incentive Plan prior to the date hereof.

(h) Buyer and Seller shall cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to
cooperate, as appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Section 9.01.

(i) No Amendment of Plans; No Other Non-Party Rights. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement is intended
to, or does, constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any
employee benefit plan, and no Person participating in any such employee
benefit plan maintained by either Seller or its Affiliates or Buyer or its
Affiliates, shall have any claim or cause of action, under ERISA or otherwise,
in respect of any provision of this Agreement as it relates to any such
employee benefit plan or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing or Section
14.08 in any way, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any current, former or future Business Employee or
Transferred Employee any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, including any right to
any compensation, benefits or other terms and conditions of employment from,
or to continued employment for any period with, any of Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates.

ARTICLE X 
TAX MATTERS

Section 10.01 Liability for Taxes.

(a) Seller shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Buyer Indemnified Parties from and against Losses attributable to, without
duplication, (i) Taxes imposed on the Company as a result of the Company
having been a member of Seller's Group prior to the Closing Date, (ii) Taxes
imposed on the Company for any Pre-Accounts Date Taxable Periods, (iii) Taxes
in excess of (A) the Deemed Tax Liability reduced by (B) any payments made by
Buyer under Section 10.01(b)(i) or by the Company under Section 10.05(b)(ii)
or (iv) or remitted by Buyer or the Company to a Tax Authority under Section
10.02, that are imposed on the Company or for which the Company may otherwise be liable for any Post-Accounts Date Taxable
Period ending on the earlier of the end of such period and the Closing Date
and (iv) Taxes that arise from or are attributable to any breach of any
covenant under Article X and any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation
or warranty made in Section 5.19(d), (e) or (f); provided, that Seller shall
not be liable for or pay, and shall not indemnify Buyer from and against, (A)
any Taxes that result from any actual or deemed election under Sections 336(e)
or 338 of the Code or any similar provisions of state, local or foreign Law as
a result of the purchase of the Shares or that result from Buyer, any
Affiliate of Buyer or (after the Closing Date) the Company engaging in any
activity or transaction (except as contemplated by this Agreement or required
by applicable Law) that would cause the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be treated as a purchase or sale of assets of the Company for
foreign, federal, state, local or other Tax purposes, (B) any Taxes for which
Buyer is liable under Section 10.01(b), and (C) any Taxes to the extent of any
related accrued current tax payable shown on the Financial Statements as of
the Accounts Date (Taxes described in clauses (A) and (C) of this proviso,
"Excluded Taxes"). Seller shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for)
Taxes of the Company (other than Excluded Taxes) allocable to any Pre-Accounts
Date Taxable Periods (except to the extent such refund (x) results from the
carryback of a Tax Attribute relating to a Post-Accounts Date Taxable Period
or (y) is reflected on the Financial Statements as a current tax receivable as
of the Accounts Date). Any such refunds received by Buyer or its Affiliates
shall be promptly, and in any event within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
such refund, paid over to Seller (less out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
connection with obtaining such refund and less any Taxes incurred in
connection with the receipt of such refund). Buyer shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to take reasonable steps to secure any such refund or credit that
would otherwise be available. Buyer and the Company shall be entitled to all
other refunds in respect of any Taxes of the Company (including to the extent
such refund results from the carryback of a Tax Attribute relating to a Post-
Accounts Date Taxable Period), and if such refunds are received by Seller or
any Affiliate thereof, Seller shall promptly, and in any event within thirty
(30) days of the receipt of any such refund, pay such refund over to, or as
directed by, Buyer (less out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with
obtaining such refund and less any Taxes incurred in connection with the
receipt of such refund).

(b) After the Closing, Buyer shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, any Losses
attributable to, without duplication, (i) Taxes imposed on the Company, or for
which the Company may otherwise be liable, for any Post-Accounts Date Taxable
Period ending on or before the Closing Date, provided, that Buyer's cumulative
liability with respect to such Taxes shall not exceed an amount equal to the
excess of (I) the Deemed Tax Liability over (II) any amount paid by the
Company to Seller pursuant to Section 10.05(b)(ii) or (iv) or to a Tax
Authority pursuant to Section 10.02(a) with respect to such taxable periods,
(ii) any breach or failure of Buyer to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Article X, (iii) Taxes imposed or required to be
paid by or in respect of the Company arising as a result of actions taken by
the Company on the Closing Date after the Closing and (iv) Excluded Taxes.

(c) For purposes of Section 10.01(a) and Section 10.01(b), whenever it is
necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company for a partial
period, the determination of the Taxes of the Company for the portion of the
period ending on and including, and the portion of the period beginning after, the Accounts Date (or Closing Date) shall be
determined by assuming that the period consisted of two (2) Taxable years or
periods, one which ended at the close of the Accounts Date (or Closing Date)
and the other which began at the beginning of the day after the Accounts Date
(or Closing Date), and (a) in the case of real and personal property Taxes,
such Taxes shall be apportioned between such two (2) Taxable years or periods
on a per diem basis and (b) all other Taxes shall be allocated between such
two (2) Taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming
that the books of the Company were closed at the close of the Accounts Date
(or Closing Date); provided, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that
are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation,
shall be apportioned between such two (2) Taxable years or periods on a daily
basis.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyer and Seller each
shall pay, and shall indemnify Buyer or Seller, as applicable, against fifty
percent (50%) of any real property transfer or gains Tax, transfer Tax, sales
Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax imposed on
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(e) To the extent of any inconsistency between this Article X and Article
XIII, this Article X shall control as to Tax matters. For the avoidance of
doubt, none of the limitations on indemnification contained in Article XIII
shall apply to claims under this Article X.

Section 10.02 Tax Returns.

(a) (i) Seller shall timely file or cause to be timely filed when due (taking
into account all extensions properly obtained) (A) all Tax Returns that are
required to be filed by or with respect to the Company on a combined,
consolidated or unitary basis with Seller or any Affiliate thereof (other than
the Company or any Subsidiary), (B) all other income or premium Tax Returns
that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company for Taxable
years or periods ending on or before the Closing Date, and (C) all other Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to the Company
(taking into account all extensions properly obtained) on or prior to the
Closing Date. Seller shall remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in
respect of the Tax Returns described in clause (A), and the Company legally
responsible for filing a Tax Return described in clause (B) or (C) shall remit
any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns. Buyer shall timely file or cause
to be timely filed when due (taking into account all extensions properly
obtained) all other Tax Returns that are required to be filed by or with
respect to the Company or any Subsidiary after the Closing Date and, with
respect to any period ending on or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall
remit or cause to be remitted any Taxes due in respect of such Tax Returns.

(ii) All Tax Returns that Buyer or Seller, as applicable, is required to file
or cause to be filed in accordance with Section 10.02(a) (other than the
portions of the federal consolidated income Tax Return that includes Seller
that do not affect Taxes for which Buyer could be liable under Section
10.01(b)(i)) that relate to any Taxable year or period beginning before the
Closing Date shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with past
practice and, on such Tax Returns, no position shall be taken, election made
or method adopted that is inconsistent with positions taken, elections made or
methods adopted in preparing and filing similar Tax Returns in prior periods
except to the extent required by applicable Law. Not less than thirty (30)
days prior to the due date for such Tax Return, taking into account extensions
(or, if such due date is within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable
following the Closing Date), the preparing party shall provide Buyer or
Seller, as applicable, with a draft copy of such Tax Return (provided,
however, that in the case of any combined, consolidated or unitary return such
copy shall include only pro forma information for the Company) for such
party's approval (which approval shall not be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed). Seller and Buyer shall reasonably cooperate to resolve
any disagreements with respect to such Tax Return and the preparing party
shall file or cause to be filed such Tax Return as finally agreed to by the
parties. In the event of any disagreement that cannot be resolved between the
Buyer and Seller, such disagreement shall be resolved by an accounting firm of
international reputation mutually agreeable to Seller and Buyer (the "Tax
Accountant"), and any such determination by the Tax Accountant shall be final.
The fees and expenses of the Tax Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer
and Seller. If the Tax Accountant does not resolve any differences between
Seller and Buyer with respect to such Tax Return at least five days prior to
the due date therefor (or in the case of a pro forma Tax Return, the due date
for the Tax Return to which such pro forma Tax Return relates), such Tax
Return shall be filed as prepared and amended to reflect the Tax Accountant's
resolution.



(iii) Within thirty (30) days after filing of the federal consolidated income
Tax Return that includes Seller with respect to Taxable years beginning after
the Accounts Date and prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a pro forma copy of such Tax Return prepared solely with
respect to the Company that illustrates the calculation of the Deemed Tax
Liability in respect of federal income Taxes for the period covered by such
Tax Return. Such pro forma Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with past practices of Seller, its Affiliates and the Company, other than with
respect to the calculation of the Deemed Tax Liability. Buyer and Seller shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreements with respect to such pro
forma Tax Return, and any disputes shall be resolved by the Tax Accountant as
provided in Section 10.02(a)(ii). Once the Deemed Tax Liability has been
calculated in accordance with this Agreement and the pro forma Tax Returns
(taking into account the resolution of any disagreements in relation to such
pro forma Tax Returns), such Deemed Tax Liability, as so calculated, shall be
considered final and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not be adjusted in
connection with any amendments to any Tax Returns or any settlements in
relation to any Tax claims or otherwise.



(b) None of Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer, except as required by applicable
Law, shall (or shall cause or permit the Company to) make or change any Tax
election, amend, refile or otherwise modify (or grant an extension of any
statute of limitation with respect to) any Tax Return, or file any Tax Return
for the first time in a jurisdiction not previously filed in, or of a type not
previously filed, in each case, relating in whole or in part to the Company or
any Subsidiary with respect to any Taxable year or period beginning before the
Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller(which shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed). Unless required by applicable
Law, neither Seller nor any Affiliate of Seller shall amend any Tax Return
relating in whole or in part to the Company or any Subsidiary in a manner that
could reasonably be expected to increase the Tax liability of the Company for
any Post-Accounts Date Taxable Period without the prior written consent of the
Buyer. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Company to, carry back any
net operating loss, capital loss or any other attribute to any Taxable year or
period (or portion thereof) prior to the Closing Date, except to the extent
required by applicable Law. Section 10.03 Contest Provisions. BUYER AND SELLER SHALL PROMPTLY NOTIFY THE
OTHER PARTY, AS APPLICABLE, IN WRITING UPON RECEIPT BY BUYER, THE SELLER, ANY
OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR THE COMPANY OF NOTICE OF ANY PENDING OR THREATENED
FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL OR FOREIGN TAX AUDITS, EXAMINATIONS OR ASSESSMENTS WHICH
COULD GIVE RISE TO A LIABILITY TO WHICH SUCH OTHER PARTY, ANY OF THEIR
AFFILIATES OR THE COMPANY IS LIABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 10.01(A), PROVIDED
THAT BUYER'S OR SELLER'S FAILURE TO SO NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY SHALL NOT LIMIT
SUCH OTHER PARTY'S RIGHTS UNDER THIS ARTICLE X EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT SUCH PARTY
IS MATERIALLY PREJUDICED BY SUCH FAILURE. EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED IN THE
NEXT SENTENCE, SELLER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE COMPANY'S
INTERESTS IN ANY TAX AUDIT OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR COURT PROCEEDING RELATING TO A
TAX RETURN PREPARED BY SELLER PURSUANT TO SECTION 10.02(A), AND TO EMPLOY
COUNSEL OF ITS CHOICE AT ITS EXPENSE; PROVIDED THAT BUYER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT
TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING UNLESS SUCH PROCEEDING INVOLVES A
COMBINED, CONSOLIDATED OR UNITARY TAX RETURN. IN THE CASE OF A TAXABLE PERIOD
ENDING AFTER THE ACCOUNTS DATE, BUYER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REPRESENT THE
COMPANY'S INTERESTS IN ANY TAX AUDIT OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR COURT PROCEEDING
(UNLESS SUCH PROCEEDING INVOLVES A COMBINED, CONSOLIDATED OR UNITARY TAX
RETURN), PROVIDED THAT SELLER SHALL BE ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE AT ITS EXPENSE
IN ANY SUCH TAX AUDIT OR ADMINISTRATIVE OR COURT PROCEEDING RELATING (IN WHOLE
OR IN PART) TO TAXES FOR WHICH SELLER IS LIABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 10.01(A).
IN EITHER CASE, THE PARTY CONTROLLING SUCH TAX AUDIT, EXAMINATION OR
PROCEEDING SHALL (A) NOTIFY THE OTHER PARTY OF SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS WITH
RESPECT TO SUCH TAX AUDIT, EXAMINATION OR PROCEEDING AND KEEP THE OTHER PARTY
REASONABLY INFORMED AND CONSULT WITH THE OTHER PARTY AS TO THE RESOLUTION OF
ANY ISSUE THAT WOULD MATERIALLY AFFECT SUCH OTHER PARTY, (B) GIVE TO THE OTHER
PARTY A COPY OF ANY TAX ADJUSTMENT PROPOSED IN WRITING WITH RESPECT TO SUCH
TAX AUDIT, EXAMINATION OR PROCEEDING AND COPIES OF ANY OTHER WRITTEN
CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE RELEVANT TAXING AUTHORITY RELATING TO SUCH TAX AUDIT,
EXAMINATION OR PROCEEDING AND (C) NOT SETTLE OR COMPROMISE ANY ISSUE WITHOUT
THE CONSENT OF SUCH OTHER PARTY, WHICH CONSENT SHALL NOT BE UNREASONABLY
WITHHELD, DELAYED OR CONDITIONED.

Section 10.04 Assistance and Cooperation. ON AND AFTER THE CLOSING DATE, EACH
OF SELLER AND BUYER SHALL (AND SHALL CAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES TO):

(a) assist the other party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with Section 10.02;

(b) cooperate fully in preparing for any audits of, or disputes with Tax
authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Company; (c) make available to the other and to any Tax Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records and documents relating to Taxes of the
Company;

(d) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or threatened
Tax audits or assessments of the Company for Taxable periods for which the
other may have a Liability under Section 10.01;

(e) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any Tax
Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with respect
to any such Taxable period;

(f) timely sign and deliver such certificates or forms as may be necessary or
appropriate to establish an exemption from (or otherwise reduce), or file Tax
Returns or other reports with respect to, Taxes described in Section 10.01(d)
(relating to sales, transfer and similar Taxes); and

(g) timely provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Article X.

Section 10.05 Tax Sharing Payments.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, as of the date
hereof, (i) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company) to, take such actions as may be necessary to terminate all contracts
and agreements between the Company, on the one hand, and Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (other than the Company), on the other hand, relating to
Tax allocation, sharing or paying agreements (including the Tax Sharing
Agreement), and none of Seller or its Affiliates shall have any continuing
obligation to the Company (or vice versa) under the Tax Sharing Agreement
after the date hereof (other than any such obligations pursuant to this
Agreement). Such termination shall be effective as of the Accounts Date.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, and
notwithstanding the termination of the Tax Sharing Agreement, as of the date
hereof, each of Seller and the Company shall make such payments as would have
been required with respect to any period from the Accounts Date to and
including the Closing Date with respect to the Company as if the terms of the
Tax Sharing Agreement were continued in accordance with past practice except
that:

(i) no Taxes will be payable by or to the Company with respect to any Taxable
year or period ending on or before the Accounts Date, but any refunds received
shall be apportioned in accordance with Section 10.01(a);

(ii) with respect to Taxable years or periods beginning after the Accounts
Date, payments in respect of federal income Taxes shall be determined in
accordance with the definition of Deemed Tax Liability (and, for the avoidance
of doubt, in no event shall such payments exceed the Deemed Tax Liability); (iii) payment shall be made to the Company by Seller or its Affiliates (other
than the Company) in the event that a deduction, loss or credit attributable
to the Company and arising in a Post-Accounts Date Taxable Period is actually
used by a member of the Seller's Group (other than the Company); and

(iv) following the finalization of any pro forma Tax Return pursuant to
Section 10.02(a)(iii), Seller or the Company, as appropriate, shall pay such
amounts (determined consistent with the principles of clauses (ii) and (iii)
above) so that the total amount paid with respect to the Taxable year or
period covered by such Tax Return pursuant to this Section 10.05 is consistent
with the calculations set forth on such pro forma Tax Return.

Section 10.06 Other Tax Matters.

(a) Except for Taxes that arise or are attributable to any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty made in Section 5.12 or Section 5.20,
the indemnification provided in this Article X shall be the sole remedy for
any claim in respect of Taxes and the provisions of Article XIII shall not
apply to such claims, except as expressly provided.

(b) Any claim for indemnity under this Article X may only be made at a time
prior to sixty (60) days after the expiration of the applicable Tax statute of
limitations with respect to the relevant Taxable period (including all periods
of extension, whether automatic or permissive). The parties agree to treat any
indemnification payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for the United States and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(c) Seller shall make or cause to be made (and shall refrain from making or
causing to be made, as applicable) Tax elections (including on a protective
basis) so that the Company shall not suffer any reduction in tax basis or
other attributes pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-36. Seller
shall not make or permit to be made any election under Section 336(e) of the
Code with respect to the disposition of the Shares hereunder.

Section 10.07 338(h)(10) Election.

(a) The parties agree, promptly following the date hereof and prior to the
Closing, to discuss and consider in good faith the making of an election under
Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and similar provisions of other state, local
and foreign tax Law (a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with respect to the
purchase of the Shares. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
determine, prior to the Closing, whether a Section 338(h)(10) Election will
result in a net tax cost to Seller as compared to a sale of the Shares without
a Section 338(h)(10) Election (the "Seller Tax Cost"). For the avoidance of
doubt, Seller Tax Cost shall include the loss of any Tax Attributes. Seller
shall agree to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election, upon Buyer's request, if
(a) Seller determines in its sole discretion acting in good faith that the
Seller Tax Cost will not be greater than zero or (b) Buyer agrees to indemnify
Seller, on an after-tax basis, for any Seller Tax Cost in a manner reasonably
acceptable to Seller. (b) If the parties agree to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election, they shall
further negotiate in good faith such amendments to this Agreement or other
documentation as may be necessary to include such agreement and certain
matters related to the Section 338(h)(10) Election, including the delivery of
appropriate tax forms and procedures regarding the purchase price allocation
for tax purposes.

ARTICLE XIII

Losses that any such Buyer Indemnified Party at any time suffers or incurs, or
becomes subject to, as a result of or in connection with:

(i) the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller
in Article IV or Article V of this Agreement; or

(ii) any breach or failure by Seller to perform any of its covenants or
obligations contained in this Agreement. (b) Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, Seller shall not be

the Buyer Indemnified Parties' Losses exceeds $2,800,000, after which Seller
shall, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence, be obligated to
indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties against all Losses
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties that in the aggregate are in excess of such
amount. The cumulative aggregate liability of Seller under Section 13.01(a)(i)
shall in no event exceed $35,000,000 (other than in respect of Losses arising
solely as a result of the inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty made by Seller in Section 4.01, Sections 5.01(a) and (b), Section
5.02 (other than Section 5.02(e)) and Section 5.23, in which case, Seller's
aggregate liability shall not exceed the Purchase Price).

Section 13.02 Indemnification by Buyer.

(a) After the Closing and subject to Article X, the other provisions of this
Article XIII and Section 14.01, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the "Seller Indemnified
Parties") from and against, and pay and reimburse, all Losses that any such

aggregate liability shall not exceed the Purchase Price).

Section 13.03 Notification of Claims.

(a) A Person who may be entitled to be indemnified and held harmless under
Section 13.01 or Section 13.02 (the "Indemnified Party"), shall promptly
notify the party that is potentially liable therefor (the "Indemnifying
Party") in writing of any pending or threatened claim or demand by a third
party that the Indemnified Party has determined has given or could reasonably
give rise to such a right under this Agreement (including a pending or
threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified
Party, such claim being a "Third-Party Claim"), describing in reasonable
detail, to the extent reasonably available at such time, the facts and
circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim or demand and
the specific representation, warranty or provision of this Agreement that the
Indemnified Party alleges to be breached; provided, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this Article XIII except to the extent the Indemnifying
Party forfeits rights or defenses, or is otherwise actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that notices for claims in
respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must
be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period
specified in Section 14.01 for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement. Following delivery of a notice of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to such
Third-Party Claim.

(b) Following receipt of a notice of a Third-Party Claim from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to Section 13.03(a), subject to Section 13.03(c), the
Indemnifying Party, by written notice to the Indemnified Party, may assume the
defense and control of such Third-Party Claim; provided, that the Indemnifying
Party shall not be entitled to assume or maintain control of the defense of
any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if (i) the Third-Party Claim relates
to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation against the Indemnified Party or (ii) if the
Indemnified Party determines in good faith that (A) an actual or likely
conflict of interest makes representation of the two parties by the same
counsel inappropriate or (B) that there may be available defenses or
counterclaims available to the Indemnified Party that are inconsistent with
those available to the Indemnifying Party.

(c) Subject to Section 13.03(d), the Indemnified Party may take any actions
reasonably necessary to defend such Third-Party Claim prior to the time that
it receives a notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by Section
13.03(b). If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party
Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim with its counsel and at its own expense, and the Indemnifying Party shall not, as long
as it diligently conducts the defense of the applicable Third-Party Claim, be
liable to the Indemnified Party for legal expenses subsequently incurred by
the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof (except as
otherwise permitted in Section 13.03(b)). Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to,
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's
expense, in the defense of any Third-Party Claim. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, from and after the delivery of a notice of a
claim for indemnification with respect to a Third-Party Claim, at the
reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnifying Party and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties of the
Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to such Third-Party Claim
at the Indemnifying Party's expense. If the Indemnifying Party fails to take
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or proceeding after
notifying the Indemnified Party of its assumption of the defense and
investigation of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume such
defense, and the reasonable fees of its attorneys and other advisors will be
covered by the indemnity provided for in this Article XIII upon determination
of the Indemnifying Party's indemnity obligations. The Indemnifying Party
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), settle,
compromise or discharge any pending or threatened Third-Party Claim or consent
to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any pending or
threatened Third-Party Claim unless (i) such settlement provides only for the
payment of monetary damages (and does not impose any injunctive relief or
otherwise impose any conditions or restrictions on the applicable Indemnified
Party) and does not involve any finding or admission of any violation of Law
on the part of the Indemnified Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party pays or
causes to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement (other than as
contemplated by Section 13.01(b) or Section 13.02(b)), (iii) such settlement
does not encumber any of the material assets of any Indemnified Party or agree
to any restriction or condition that would materially adversely affect any
Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Party's business and (iv)
the Indemnifying Party obtains, as a condition of any settlement or other
resolution, a complete and unconditional release of each Indemnified Party
from any and all liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim. If the
Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within thirty (30)
days following its receipt of the notice of a Third-Party Claim that it
desires to assume the defense and investigation of such Third-Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to control any such defense.

(d) No Indemnifying Party shall have any liability under this Article XIII for
any Losses arising out of or in connection with any Third-Party Claim that is
settled or compromised by an Indemnified Party without the prior consent of
such Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(e) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim under this Article XIII
that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give
written notice to the Indemnifying Party setting forth, to the extent
reasonably available at such time, (i) a reasonably detailed description of
the claim, (ii) a good faith estimate of the amount of the claim (to the
extent ascertainable) and (iii) the specific representation, warranty or
provision of this Agreement that the Indemnified Party alleges to be breached. The failure by the Indemnified Party
to provide such notice on a timely basis shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this Article XIII except to the extent
the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses, or is otherwise actually
and materially prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that notices
for claims in respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement must be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival
period specified in Section 14.01 for such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall have a period of 30 days within
which to respond to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not respond
within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party will be deemed to have
accepted such claim. If the Indemnifying Party rejects all or any part of such
claim, the Indemnified Party shall be free to seek enforcement of its rights
of indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such claims.

(f) If there shall be any conflict between the provisions of this Section
13.03 and Section 10.03 (relating to Tax contests), the provisions of Section
10.03 shall control with respect to Tax contests.

Section 13.04 Payment. ANY PAYMENT ARISING UNDER THIS ARTICLE XIII SHALL BE
MADE BY WIRE TRANSFER OF IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FUNDS TO SUCH ACCOUNT OR
ACCOUNTS AS THE INDEMNIFIED PARTY SHALL DESIGNATE TO THE INDEMNIFYING PARTY IN
WRITING.

Section 13.05 No Duplication; Exclusive Remedies.

(a) Any liability for indemnification hereunder and under any other
Transaction Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by
reason of the same Loss.

(b) Prior to the Closing, other than in the case of fraud by Seller or any of
its Affiliates, the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or
any certificate or instrument delivered hereunder shall be refusal to
consummate the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 12.01.

(c) Following the Closing, other than in the case of fraud by Buyer or Seller
or any of their respective Affiliates, and except for breaches or non-
performance of provisions in this Agreement for which the remedy of specific
performance is available pursuant to Section 14.14, the indemnification
provisions of Article XIII and, with respect to Taxes, Article X, shall be the
sole and exclusive remedies of Seller and Buyer, respectively, for any breach
of the representations or warranties in this Agreement and for any failure to
perform or comply with any covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of Buyer, on behalf of itself
and each other Buyer Indemnified Party, and Seller, on behalf of itself and
each other Seller Indemnified Party, hereby waives, from and after the
Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) it may have against Seller or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives and Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives, as the
case may be, arising under or based upon this Agreement, any certificate or
instrument delivered in connection herewith (whether under this Agreement or
arising under common Law or any other applicable Law), except pursuant to: (i) indemnification provisions set forth in this Article XIII or (ii) as provided
under (A) the provisions of Section 2.03, (B) the provisions of Article X, (C)
the provisions hereof providing for equitable remedies or (D) the provisions
of any other Transaction Agreement.

Section 13.06 Additional Indemnification Provisions.

(a) With respect to each indemnification obligation in this Agreement (i) each
such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis, (ii) all Losses
shall be net of any related Eligible Insurance Proceeds and (iii) in no event
shall the Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified Party for any
consequential, special, incidental, punitive or exemplary damages (other than
(A) any such damages actually paid to any unaffiliated third party or (B) any
such damages to the extent they are reasonably foreseeable (other than, in the
case of this subclause (B), any punitive or exemplary damages even if such
damages are reasonably foreseeable)). For purposes of this Section 13.06(a),
"reasonably foreseeable" shall be determined solely by reference to the
conduct of the Business as currently conducted and shall not take into account
any current or future plans for the expansion, reduction, modification,
improvement or alteration of the Business following the Closing, regardless of
whether any such plans are communicated to or otherwise known by Seller or its
Affiliates.

(b) In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any
amount in respect of any Loss paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this
Article XIII, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the
Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the
amount of reasonable costs incurred by it in procuring such recovery, which
costs shall not exceed the amount so recovered), but not in excess of any
amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such claim.

(c) If any portion of Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article XIII could be recovered from a third party not affiliated with
the relevant Indemnified Party based on the underlying claim or demand
asserted against such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall
promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party and, upon the request
of the Indemnifying Party, shall use reasonable best efforts to collect the
maximum amount recoverable from such third party, in which event the
Indemnifying Party shall reimburse the Indemnified Party for all reasonable
costs incurred in connection with such collection (which costs of collection
shall not exceed the amount recoverable from such third party). If any portion
of Losses actually paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article
XIII could have been recovered from a third party not affiliated with the
relevant Indemnified Party based on the underlying claim or demand asserted
against such Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall transfer, to
the extent transferable, such of its rights to proceed against such third
party as are necessary to permit the Indemnifying Party to recover from such
third party any amount actually paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article XIII.

(d) The parties shall treat any indemnification payment made under this
Agreement as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

(e) If any portion of Losses to be paid by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this Article XIII may be covered, in whole or in part, by third-party
insurance coverage, the Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying
Party. The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable best efforts to collect the
maximum amount of insurance proceeds thereunder, and all such proceeds
actually collected in respect of any Loss (net of (i) the amount of reasonable
costs incurred by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in collecting such
proceeds and (ii) the present value of any increase in insurance premiums or
other charges paid or reasonably expected to be paid by such Indemnified Party
or its Affiliate's arising out of such Loss) shall be considered "Eligible
Insurance Proceeds."

(f) For purposes of determining whether a breach of any representation or
warranty made in this Agreement has occurred, and for calculating the amount
of any Loss under this Article XIII, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be read without regard to any "materiality,"
"Company Material Adverse Effect," "Buyer Material Adverse Effect" or other
similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable to such
representation or warranty, other than (i) the representation and warranty in
Section 5.04(b) and (ii) any use of the defined terms "Material Contract" or
"Material Distributor".

Section 13.07 Reserves. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS, SELLER MAKES NO REPRESENTATION
OR WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO, AND NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ANY
OTHER TRANSACTION AGREEMENTS, OR IN ANY OTHER AGREEMENT, DOCUMENT OR
INSTRUMENT TO BE DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED

HEREBY OR THEREBY, WITH RESPECT TO (A) THE ADEQUACY OR SUFFICIENCY OF THE
RESERVES OF THE COMPANY OR (B) THE FUTURE PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS.

INTENDED THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THE INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER
AND SELLER, RESPECTIVELY, IN THIS ARTICLE. NEITHER BUYER'S NOR SELLER'S RIGHT
TO INDEMNITY PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE SHALL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY (A) ANY
INVESTIGATION CONDUCTED BY OR ON BEHALF OF SUCH PARTY OR BY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF
BUYER OR BY ANY KNOWLEDGE OF SELLER, AS APPLICABLE, ACQUIRED BY OR ON BEHALF
OF SUCH PARTY AS A RESULT OF SUCH INVESTIGATION OR OTHERWISE, IN EACH CASE,

Agreements, the formation, breach, termination or validity of the Transaction
Agreements or the recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of
the Transaction Agreement, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery in New Castle County and any state appellate court therefrom (or,
if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over any
matter, any other Delaware state or federal court), and all claims in respect
of any such Action shall be heard and determined in such aforesaid courts. (b) Any such Action may and shall be brought in such courts and each of Seller
and Buyer irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such Action in any such
court or that such Action was brought in an inconvenient court and shall not
plead or claim the same.

process by registered or certified mail (or any substantially similar form of
mail), postage prepaid, to such party at its address as provided in Section

PARTY OR PARTIES ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT THEREOF. ANY SUCH WAIVER SHALL BE
VALIDLY AND SUFFICIENTLY AUTHORIZED FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS AGREEMENT IF, AS
TO ANY PARTY, IT IS AUTHORIZED IN WRITING BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF
SUCH PARTY. THE FAILURE OF ANY PARTY HERETO TO ENFORCE AT ANY TIME ANY
PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED TO BE A WAIVER OF SUCH
PROVISION, NOR IN ANY WAY TO AFFECT THE VALIDITY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY PART
HEREOF OR THE RIGHT OF ANY PARTY THEREAFTER TO ENFORCE EACH AND EVERY SUCH PROVISION. NO WAIVER OF ANY BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE HELD TO
