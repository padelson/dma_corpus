a)   The Vendor and the Purchaser will use their respective best endeavours

     control from Vendor to Purchaser contemplated by this Agreement, or such

                                       33
<PAGE>

     other accommodation or arrangement with MBIA in form and substance
     reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser such that the Medium Term Notes are
     not in default upon Completion; provided however, that the obligation of
     the Vendor under this clause 6.10, and in respect of satisfying the
     Condition in clause 2.1(e), shall be solely to obtain a waiver or other
     accommodation or arrangement such that the Medium Term Notes are not in
     default due to the change of control at Completion, and the Vendor shall
     have no obligation in respect of any terms or conditions of the Purchaser's
     accommodation or arrangement with MBIA that is not related to the waiver or
     accommodation in respect of the change of control. The Vendor will bear the
     fee charged by MBIA as a condition  of giving any such waiver or making
     such accommodation.

(b)  In addition to its obligations under clause 6.20, at its expense, the
     Purchaser shall make application to MBIA for such waiver or accommodation,
     including timely submittal of any and all information, financial or
     otherwise, requested by MBIA in order to obtain such waiver or
     accommodation, and Purchaser and/or Purchaser's Guarantor shall execute
     such agreements and undertakings as shall reasonably be required by MBIA to
     issue its financial guaranty of the repayment of the Medium Term Notes.

(c)  If the waiver or accommodation referred to in paragraph (a) is obtained, no
     amount will be included in the amount to be funded under clause 7.3(a) by
     the Purchaser on Completion in respect of the Medium Term Notes and the
     Purchaser acknowledges that:

     (i)    the Medium Term Notes will remain outstanding following Completion;

     (ii)   the Medium Term Notes are obligations of the relevant Group
            Companies; and

     (iii)  neither the Purchaser nor any Group Company has any recourse to the
            Vendor in respect of the Medium Term Notes.

(d)  If the waiver or accommodation referred to in paragraph (a) is not
     obtained on or before the Completion Date and MBIA exercises its rights
     under clause 5.2 of the Reimbursement Agreement or clause 8.2 of the Credit
     Wrapped MTN Deed Poll then, unless otherwise agreed between the Vendor and
     the Purchaser:

     (i)    the amount to be included in the Actual Debt Amount to be funded by
            the Purchaser on Completion in respect of the Medium Term Notes
            shall be the face amount of the Medium Term Notes together with any
            interest on the Medium Term Notes accrued but unpaid at Completion
            and any other moneys then accrued and unpaid in respect of the
            Medium Term Notes but not including, for the avoidance of doubt,
            any moneys becoming due or payable by reason of the transactions
            contemplated by this Agreement; and

                                       34
<PAGE>

     (ii)   the Purchaser shall in addition pay to the relevant Group Companies
            any amounts in excess of the amounts referred to in paragraph
            (i) above that are required to be paid to MBIA under the
            Reimbursement Agreement and/or the Credit Wrapped MTN Deed Poll,
            and, for the avoidance of doubt, such excess amounts will not form
            part of the Actual Debt Amount and will not be deducted
            from Enterprise Value for the purpose of clause 4.1(a).

6.11 Swaps

(a)  The parties acknowledge and agree that, on Completion, or such other time
     as the parties may agree, the Swaps:

     (i)    at the option of the counterparties, may be terminated by those
            counterparties or may remain outstanding in accordance with their
            existing terms; or

     (ii)   if agreed between the relevant counterparties, the relevant Group
            Companies and the Purchaser, may be novated to other parties in
            place of the present counterparties.

(b)  The Purchaser may negotiate with the relevant counterparties to determine
     the course of action with respect to the Swaps and the Vendor will, at the
     request and expense of the Purchaser, provide any reasonable assistance
     required by the Purchaser in connection with the Swaps.

(c)  At the same time as the Vendor notifies the Actual Debt Amount to the
     Purchaser under clause 6.7, the Vendor will also determine and notify to
     the Purchaser the net Swap Termination Amounts for all of the Swaps, which
     will be:

     (i)    in the case of any Swaps to be terminated by the counterparty, the
            actual Swap Termination Amount payable or receivable by the relevant
            Group Company in respect of each such Swap, including any break
            fees or indemnity payments; and

     (ii)   in the case of any Swaps that are to remain outstanding or which are
            to be novated, the amount that would have been the Swap Termination
            Amount if such Swap had been terminated at Completion or such other
            time as the parties may agree,

            and the net of all such Swap Termination Amounts shall form part of
            the Actual Debt Amount for the purposes of this Agreement, with any
            net amount receivable by the Group Companies being a decrease in the
            Actual Debt Amount and any net amount payable by the Group Companies
            being an increase in the Actual Debt Amount.

     after Completion. Upon the expiration of such 12 month period, Purchaser
     will cease, and will cause to cease, all use of the TXU Marks in connection
     with its business.

(b)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Purchaser must:

    (i)     procure that, from the day that is 12 months after Completion, the
            Purchaser and all other Purchaser Affiliates and the relevant Group
            Companies do not use or display the TXU Marks in any document,
            electronic media or other publication given to a third party; and

    (ii)    procure that, from the day that is 12 months after Completion, the
            Purchaser and all other Purchaser Affiliates and the relevant Group
            Companies do not use or display the TXU Marks in any manner

     If Purchaser sells a substantial portion of the Business after completion,

     unexpired period of time under (i) and (ii) above, provided that such
     purchaser agrees to be bound by the terms of this clause 9.

(c)  The Purchaser shall not be deemed to have violated clause 9.1(a) by
     reason of

     (i)    the appearance of the TXU Marks in or on any tools, dies,
            equipment, engineering/manufacturing drawings, manuals, work
            sheets, operating procedures, other written materials or other
            Assets that are used for internal purposes only in connection with
            the Business;

     (ii)   the appearance of the TXU Marks in or on any third party's
            publications, marketing materials, brochures, instruction sheets,
            equipment or products that the Vendor distributed in the ordinary
            course of business or pursuant to an agreement prior to Completion,
            and that generally are in the public domain, or any other similar
            uses by any such third party over which the Purchaser has no
            control; or

     (iii)  the use by the Purchaser of the TXU Marks in a non-trademark manner
            for purposes of conveying to customers or the general public that
            the name of a Group Company and/or the Business has changed or the
            change in ownership or historical origins of the Business.

(d)  If the Purchaser has failed to comply with clause 9.1(a), the Vendor may
     (at the Purchaser's cost and expense) take such action as may be necessary
     to ensure compliance by the Purchaser and all other Purchaser Affiliates
     and the relevant Group Company with clause 9.1(a).

                                       51
<PAGE>

(e)  The Purchaser shall:

     (i)    transfer to any person nominated by the Vendor any trade marks
            which include the names "Texas Utilities", "TU", "TXU Australia",
            "TU Australia" or "TXU";

     (ii)   make all necessary filings with the relevant Government Agency for
            the transfer of any trade marks under paragraph 9.2; and

     (iii)  not disparage, libel, slander or cause intentional commercial harm
            or dilute to any of the business names, trade marks, and internet
            domain names of any of the Vendor or any Group Company used in the
            Business.

(f)  Neither the Vendor nor any Vendor Affiliate shall, following Completion,
     use the name of any Group Company in Australia; provided, however, except
     during the first 12 months after Completion (provided that Purchaser
     remains in compliance with this clause 9.1), nothing herein shall impair or
     restrict the Vendor's right to use TXU Marks (except "TXU Australia" and
     "TU Australia"), or any other business name, trademark, or trade name of
     any Vendor Group Company.

9.2  Change of Names of Group Companies

     filing of the relevant resolutions under clause 9.2(a).

9.3  Excluded Books and Records

(a)  The Vendor may retain the Excluded Books and Records and the

     as possible following Completion.

(b)  If for any reason the Purchaser requires access to or copies of any
     Excluded Book or Record, the Vendor must provide that access or
     copy unless it would be unreasonable in all the circumstances to
     expect that the Vendor would do so or if the giving of access or
     the delivery of any such material would result in the Vendor losing
     any legal rights or privilege in respect of the relevant Excluded
     Book or Record and for these purposes the Vendor may delete such
     material from the Excluded Books and Records before providing
     access.

     of without the prior written consent of the Vendor.

investigation or defence of any matter in relation to Third Party Claims

     reasonably requests and as is necessary for the purposes of preparing the
     financial statements and Tax Returns of the Purchaser or any Group Company
     in respect of any period which includes the Completion Date or any
     subsequent period in accordance with the reporting requirements and
     timetable of the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company and for the

of the Business from the Vendor Group at Completion.

                                       54
<PAGE>

order to facilitate the transition of the administration and management of the

      question, immediately account (or procure that the relevant Group Company
      accounts) to the Vendor for whichever is the lesser of:

      (i)  any sum recovered in respect of that liability (including any
           interest or repayment supplement paid by the person but after
           deduction of any Tax payable in respect of the receipt of that sum);
           and

      (ii) the amount paid by the Vendor in respect of that liability.

11.14 Right to Control Proceedings for Third Party Claims

(a)   The Purchaser shall give to the Vendor a Third Party Claim Notice within
      2 months after it becomes aware of the existence of  the Third Party
      Claim and that it may constitute a Third Party Claim.

(b)   Provided the Vendor has agreed to fully indemnify the Purchaser and
      any Group Company for all costs, damages or expenses in respect of
      the relevant Claim, the Vendor may by Notice to the Purchaser given
      within 10 Business Days after its receipt of a Third Party Claim
      Notice, elect to:

      (i)   take over the conduct of a Third Party Claim; and

      (ii)  take such actions as the Vendor may decide, including the right to
            negotiate, defend and/or settle the Third Party Claim and to
            recover costs incurred as a consequence of the Third Party Claim
            from any person provided that the Purchaser is not obliged to
            undertake any act or enter into any settlement if to do so would
            prejudice the Purchaser in any way.

(c)   Where the Vendor gives an election under clause 11.14(b), the
      Vendor must pay the costs of the Third Party Claim, except that the
      Purchaser must pay to the Vendor any costs recovered by the
      Purchaser or any Group Company in connection with the Third Party
      Claim net of any Tax payable in respect of the receipt of that sum,
      immediately upon receipt of that money by the Purchaser or the
      Group Companies.

(d)   The Purchaser must provide to the Vendor (at the Vendor's cost) all
      assistance (and procure that the Group Companies provide all
      assistance) reasonably requested by the Vendor in connection with
      any Third Party Claims, including:

      (i)   the execution of necessary or appropriate documents; and

      (ii)  the supply of relevant information, books and records promptly upon
            request.

                                       60
<PAGE>

(e)   If the Purchaser gives the Vendor a Third Party Claim Notice under
      clause 11.14(a) and the Vendor does not elect to take over the
      control of any Third Party Claim under clause 11.14(b), the
      following provisions will apply to that Third Party Claim:

      (i)    the Purchaser must at reasonable intervals provide the Vendor with
             written reports concerning the conduct, negotiation, control,
             defence and/or settlement of the Third Party Claim;

      (ii)   the Purchaser must notify the Vendor of any Offer and consult the
             Vendor concerning the terms of any Offer;

      (iii)  the Purchaser must comply with all reasonable requests made by the
             Vendor about the negotiation, settlement and/or defence of that
             Third Party Claim provided that in doing so the Purchaser is not
             prejudiced in any way:

      (iv)   if the Purchaser fails to comply with its obligations contained in
             this clause 11.14 and that failure materially prejudices the rights
             or the ability of the Vendor to defend the Third Party Claim or
             mitigate its Loss under the Third Party Claim, the Vendor will
             cease to have any Liability to the Purchaser in respect of that
             Claim; and

      (v)    subject to the Purchaser not being obliged to act in a manner that
             prejudices it in any way, if the Vendor has requested in writing
             that the Purchaser accept (or procure that any Group Company
             accepts) any Offer and the Purchaser does not accept (or does not
             procure the acceptance by any Group Company of) that Offer, the
             maximum liability of the Vendor (if any) to the Purchaser for that
             Third Party Claim will be the amount of the Offer.

(f)   Until such time as the Vendor makes (or is given the opportunity to
      make) an election under clause 11.14(b), the Purchaser must not and
      must not allow any Group Company to accept, compromise or pay any
      claim or demand or agree to arbitrate, compromise or settle any
      legal proceedings which may lead to liability on the part of the
      Vendor under any Third Party Claim.

11.15 Reduction in amount payable by Vendor due to a Tax effect

The amount payable by the Vendor to the Purchaser for a breach of a Warranty
under this Agreement will be reduced if:

(a)   the Purchaser or any Group Company incurs expenditure or suffers a
      Loss in connection with that breach or the matter which gives rise
      to that breach; and

(b)   the expenditure or Loss is an allowable deduction under the
      provisions of the 1936 Tax Act or 1997 Tax Act (or any equivalent
      legislation) or is included in determining the amount of any
      deductible loss. The amount of the reduction referred to in this
      clause will be equal to the amount of the expenditure or Loss to
      which the breach of Warranty relates multiplied by the statutory
      Tax rate applying to the Purchaser or the relevant Group Company in
      the year in which the expenditure or Loss is incurred.

                                       61

11.16 Exclusive Remedies

The Purchaser covenants that, except for matters relating to fraud, deceit and
wilful misconduct, in respect of any matters under or contemplated in this
Agreement, it will not make any claim whatsoever against any member of the
Vendor Group (other than the Vendor under this Agreement) and its rights are
limited solely to such rights as it may have against the Vendor under this
Agreement.

11.17 Purchaser's and Purchaser's Guarantor's Warranties and Indemnities

(a)   The Purchaser warrants to the Vendor that each statement contained
      in Schedule 2 is true, accurate and not misleading as at the date
      of this Agreement. This warranty is deemed to be repeated on the
      Completion Date.

(b)   The Purchaser indemnifies the Vendor from all Liabilities and Losses
      which the Vendor suffers or incurs by reason of:

      (i) a claim arising out of any of the Purchaser's warranties being
          untrue or inaccurate in any respect; or

      (ii) a claim arising out of any failure by the Purchaser to fulfil
           its obligations under this Agreement.

11.18 Vendor's Indemnity

The Vendor indemnifies the Purchaser and any Group Company:

(a)   from all Liabilities and Losses which the Purchaser and any Group Company
      suffers or incurs by reason of:

      (i)   a Claim arising out of any of the Warranties being untrue or
            inaccurate in any respect;

      (ii)  a Claim arising out of any failure by the Vendor to fulfil its
            obligations under this Agreement; or

      (iii) any Claim by a Vendor Affiliate against a Group Company (other than
            a Claim expressly permitted under this Agreement);

                                       62
<PAGE>

      (iv)  any Claim arising out of the Liabilities, on an unconsolidated
            basis, of the Company prior to Completion (for avoidance of doubt,
            this indemnity does not apply to the Liabilities of any other Group
            Company); and

(b)   from all Third Party Claims in relation to or arising from:

      (i)   any matter which constitutes, or circumstances that constitute, a
            breach of any of the Warranties or other covenants and
            representations of the Vendor in this agreement;

      (ii)  any failure by the Vendor to fulfil their obligations under this
            agreement;

      (iii) the conduct or Liability of any other Vendor Affiliate at any time,
            including, but not limited to, the giving by LP1 and LP2, in their
            own capacity or in the capacity of limited partners of the TXU ALP
            of guarantees in relation to the migration of LP1 and LP2
            to Australia for tax purposes; or

      (iv)  Liabilities, on an unconsolidated basis, of the Company prior to
            Completion (for avoidance of doubt, this indemnity does not apply to
            the Liabilities of any other Group Company).

11.19 Tax Indemnity

The Vendor indemnifies the Purchaser and the Group Companies for Tax or
Liabilities which the Purchaser and/or any Group Company suffers or incurs by
reason of a Claim arising out of any of the Tax Warranties being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect.

11.20 Scope of Tax Indemnity

(a)   This clause applies to the extent that a Tax Liability under Clause 11.19
      relates to an event (an "Adjustment Event") that takes place prior to
      Completion and results in a Group Company either:

      (i)   deriving additional assessable income or incurring reduced allowable
            deductions under the 1997 Tax Act or the 1936 Tax Act (a 'Tax
            Adjustment'); or

      (ii)  breaching the same business test in Division 165 of the 1997 Tax Act
            or Section 80E of the 1936 Act.

(b)   The parties intend that the timing and amount of any Tax or Liability that
      arises in relation to an Adjustment Event shall take account the
      utilisation of the Carry Forward Losses by the Purchaser Group. In
      particular, the timing and amount payable by the Vendor to the Purchaser
      under clause 11.19 that relates to an Adjustment Event shall be determined
      according to the following principles:

                                       63
<PAGE>

      (i)   The Purchaser Group shall undertake its best endeavours to offset
            the Tax Adjustment against the Carry Forward Losses.

      (ii)  To the extent that either:

            (A)  the Tax Adjustment is offset against the Carry Forward Losses
                 and the Carry Forward Losses would otherwise have been
                 available to the Purchaser to be claimed as a deduction under
                 Tax Law; or

            (B)  the Carry Forward Losses are unavailable because the same
                 business test in Division 165 of the 1997 Tax Act or
                 Section 80E of the 1936 Act was failed,

            the timing and amount payable in respect to an Adjustment Event
            shall be determined by reference to the timing and amount of Carry
            Forward Losses utilized against the Tax Adjustment that would
            otherwise have been utilised by the Purchaser Group. For example,
            if there is a Tax Adjustment of $100 in respect of the 2000 tax
            year, and if the Tax Adjustment is offset by $100 of Carry Forward
            Losses, Vendor shall have no liability to the Purchaser with respect
            to the Tax Adjustment, but will be liable to the Purchaser with
            respect to Taxes paid by the Purchaser or any Group Company for the
            tax year in which the $100 of Carry Forward Losses would otherwise
            be utilized. For this purpose the $100 of Carry Forward Losses
            would be deemed to be otherwise utilized after the remaining Carry
            Forward Losses have been utilized.

      (iii) In the event the Vendor is required to make a payment to the
            Purchaser under clause 11.21, the parties shall cooperate with each
            other and each other's agents, including accounting firms and legal
            counsel, in determining the timing of the payment. The Purchaser
            will make available to the Vendor all information necessary for the
            Vendor to determine and verify the timing of any payment in
            accordance with these principles including, but not limited to
            evidence of the utilisation to date of the carry forward losses by
            the Vendor.

      (iv)  The Purchaser shall take no action to cancel the Carry Forward
            Losses under Section 707-145 of the 1997 Tax Act or otherwise cause
            the Carry Forward Losses to not be available to offset Tax
            Adjustments.

(c)   The Vendor shall not be liable to make any payment under clause 11.19 in
      respect of any amount to the extent that (except in the event of fraud or
      dishonesty on the part of the Vendor):

      (i)   an amount (less costs and expenses) has been recovered by the
            Purchaser or any Group Company in respect of the same subject
            matter (including any Tax benefit realized or to be realized by the
            Purchaser or any Group Company in any period after the Completion
            Date);

                                       64
<PAGE>

      (ii)  the Claim is for an amount provided for in the Accounts; or

      (iii) the Claim relates to a tax liability in respect of income earned or
            derived or deemed to have been earned or derived by the Purchaser
            or a Group Company at any time prior to the Completion Date or that
            may be assessed or levied as a result of any transaction, act
            matter or thing which took place or happened during the period
            commencing the from the Accounts Date that is included in the
            Completion Statement (including by reducing the Carry Forward
            Losses).

(d)   Any sum payable by the  Vendor to the Purchaser and the Group under
      clause  11.19  shall be paid free and clear of any deduction or
      withholding whatsoever.

(e)   If any deduction or withholding is required by law to be made from
      any payment by the Vendor under clause 11.19, or if the Purchaser
      is subject to Tax in respect of any such payment, the Vendor shall
      increase the amount of the payment by such additional amount as is
      necessary to ensure that the net amount received and retained by
      the Purchaser after taking account of all deductions or
      withholdings or Tax is equal to the amount which it would have
      received and retained had the payment in question not been subject
      to any deductions or withholdings or Tax.

(f)   In the event any Group Company declares to pay or pays a dividend
      from 1 January 2004 to Completion, the Vendor shall indemnify the
      Purchaser for any Loss relating to the Purchaser's subsequent
      election to consolidate for Australian tax purposes referable to
      Group Company's tax cost setting amount.

11.21 US Tax Indemnity

(a)   The Vendor shall indemnify, defend, save and hold harmless the
      Purchaser, any Group Company and any of their successors or assigns
      from and against any and all Taxes arising under any Tax Law of the
      United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia (i)
      with respect to all periods ending on or prior to the Completion (a
      "Pre-Completion Period"), (ii) with respect to any period beginning
      before the Completion and ending after Completion (a "Straddle
      Period"), but only with respect to the portion of such period up to
      and including the date of Completion (such portion, a "Pre-Completion
      Partial Period," and the portion of such period that begins after the
      Completion, a "Post-Closing Partial Period") and with respect to the
      entire calendar year 2004 to the extent that such Taxes are U.S.
      federal income taxes.

(b)   Any Taxes arising under any Tax Law of the United States or any state
      thereof or the District of Columbia for a period including a
      Pre-Completion Partial Period and a Post-Completion Partial Period
      shall be apportioned between such Pre-Completion Partial Period and

                                       65
<PAGE>

      such Post-Completion Partial Period, based, in the case of real and
      personal property Taxes, on a per diem basis and, in the case of other
      Taxes, on the actual activities, taxable income or taxable loss of the
      applicable entity during such Pre-Completion Partial Period and such
      Post-Completion Partial Period.

(c)   The Vendor shall not be liable to make any payment under this clause
      11.21 in respect of any Tax Liability to the extent that (except in
      the event of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the Vendor):

      (i)   an amount (less costs and expenses) has been recovered by the
            Purchaser or any Group Company in respect of the same subject
            matter;

      (ii)  the Claim is for an amount provided for in the Accounts or in the
            Completion Statement;

      (iii) such Tax Liability would not have arisen but for a voluntary act,
            omission or transaction done, made or carried out by any one or
            more of the Purchaser and any Group Company after Completion
            otherwise than:

            (A) as required by law;

            (B) pursuant to a legally binding obligation or commitment
                created on or before Completion;

            (C) in the ordinary course of business of the Group as carried
                on immediately before Completion; or

            (D) as requested by or at the direction of the Vendor.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.   General Provisions Relating to Taxes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12.1  U.S. Tax Matters

(a)   On the date of Completion, the Vendor shall furnish Purchaser an
      affidavit as described in Code Section 1445(b)(2) stating, under
      penalty of perjury, that the Vendor is not a foreign person within
      the meaning of Code Section 1445(f)(3) and providing to Purchaser
      the Vendor's United States taxpayer identification number.

b)    The Purchaser will not make an election under Section 338(g) of the
      Code (or any corresponding elections under state or local tax law) with
      respect to any Group Company unless requested by the Vendor. The Vendor
      may, in its sole discretion, request that the Purchaser make an election
      under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to any Group Company, in
      which case the Purchaser shall make such election as requested by the
      Vendor. In the event an election under Section 338(g) of the Code is made

                                       66
<PAGE>

      for any Group Company pursuant to the request of the Vendor, the Purchaser
      and the Vendor shall (i) cooperate with each other to prepare and file all
      forms, and take all reasonable actions or refrain from taking any actions
      (as applicable) necessary to give effect to such election, and (ii) report
       the transactions contemplated by this Agreement consistent with
      any such election. The Vendor shall indemnify and hold harmless the
      Purchaser and the Group Companies for any Losses incurred in connection
      with making a 338(g) election or any other election requested by the
      Vendor pursuant to this clause 12.1(b).

(c)   The Vendor may, in its sole and absolute discretion, request that
      Purchaser elect, pursuant to Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3, to
      treat TXUA and any of its direct or indirect subsidiaries which are
      eligible to make such an election as a disregarded entity for United
      States federal income tax purposes with respect to any period after the
      Completion Date that begins on or prior to December 31, 2004. If requested
      by Vendor, Purchaser shall prepare and file IRS Form 8832, Entity
      Classification Election, together with any other information or
      documentation required by the Code or Treasury Regulations to
      validly elect disregarded entity treatment as requested by Vendor. The
      Vendor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Purchaser and the Group
      Companies for any Losses incurred in connection with filing an election
      required by the Vendor pursuant to this clause 12.1(c).

12.2  GST
(a)   All amounts referred to in this Agreement, unless otherwise stated,
      are exclusive of any GST.

(b)   A recipient of a taxable supply ('recipient') made under or in
      connection with this Agreement by another party to this Agreement
      ('supplier') must, in addition to paying the consideration for that
      taxable supply:

      (i)    pay to the supplier an amount equal to the consideration for that
             taxable supply but for the application of this paragraph (b) ('GST
             exclusive consideration') multiplied by the rate of GST prevailing
             on the date the taxable supply was made, without deduction or
             set-off of any other amount; and

      (ii)   make that payment as and when the GST exclusive consideration or
             part of it must be paid or provided, except that the recipient need
             not pay unless and until the recipient has received a tax invoice
             (or an adjustment note, as appropriate) in respect of that taxable
             supply.

(c)   Despite any other provision of this Agreement, if a party is
      required to reimburse or indemnify another party for any Loss (or
      part) that the other party has incurred or will incur in connection

                                       67
<PAGE>

      with this Agreement, then for the purposes of calculating the
      amount of the reimbursement or indemnification, the reference to
      the Loss in this Agreement is a reference to the Loss reduced by
      the amount of any input tax credit to which the other party (or, if
      the other party is a member of a GST group, the representative
      member of that GST group) is entitled in respect of that Loss.

(d)   Any term used in this clause 12.2 that is defined in the GST Law has the
      same meaning in this clause 12.2, as appropriate.

12.3  Income Tax Consolidation

(a)   With respect to the Group Companies, the Vendor confirms that:

      (i)  no election has been made or communicated to the
           Australian Taxation Office (ATO) at the date of this
           Agreement, and no election will be made or communicated
           to the ATO on or before the Completion Date to
           consolidate any consolidatable group or potential MEC
           group unless requested by the Purchaser in a form and
           in respect of a date nominated by the Purchaser;

     (ii)  no choices or elections will be made by any Group Company under
           Part 3-90 of the 1997 Tax Act on or before the Completion Date
           unless requested or directed to do so by the Purchaser; and

     (iii) if, prior to the Completion Date, the Purchaser directs or requests
           that a choice or election be made by a Group Company under Part 3-90
           of the 1997 Tax Act, the Vendor must procure that the Group Company
           make or prepare the choice or election in a form and manner
           which has been approved in writing by the Purchaser prior to the
           date the choice or election must be or is to be made under Part 3-90
           of the 1997 Tax Act;

(b)  With respect to the Group Companies, the Purchaser acknowledges that:

     (i)   if no election is validly made after the Completion Date specifying
           1 January 2004 as the relevant date for the formation of any
           Consolidated Group or MEC group, then Tax may be payable by some of
           the Group Companies in respect of the income years 30 June 2004 or
           30 June 2005 (or substituted accounting periods in lieu thereof);

     (ii)  the Vendor shall not be liable to make any payment to the Purchaser
           in respect of any Claim (including any Claim under the tax indemnity
           in clause 11.19) that relates in any way to Tax payable by any of the
           Group Companies in respect of the income years ended 30 June 2004 or
           30 June 2005 (or substituted accounting periods in lieu thereof)
           arising solely as a result of either:

                                       68
<PAGE>

                     no election being validly made specifying 1 January 2004

<PAGE>

     (v)   The determination of the Tax Expert as to the matters in dispute will
           (in the absence of manifest error) be final and binding on the
           parties.

     (vi)  In making its determination the Tax Expert will act as an expert and
           not as an arbitrator.

     (vii) The costs of the Tax Expert shall be borne by the parties in
           accordance with the Expert's determination.

(i)  The Lodging Party must not lodge, or cause to be lodged, any Tax Returns

(l)  The Vendor and the Purchaser agree that the Purchaser shall take such
     steps as are in its control to procure that:

     (i)  LP1 and LP2 (each a "Surrendering Company") make such surrender or
          allocation of any Tax loss for United Kingdom tax purposes to any
          company (the "Claimant Company") in the same group of companies for
          the purposes of any Tax as such Surrendering Company, as the Vendor
          may require (for no consideration payable by the Claimant Company or
          any member of the Vendor's group), where such surrender or allocation
          is in respect of any tax period ending on or prior to the Completion
          Date.  Where the Vendor requires any Surrendering Company to make
          a surrender or allocation of Tax losses, the Purchaser shall procure
          that Surrendering Company shall give all such consents, and do all
          such things, as the Vendor may reasonably request in writing to ensure
          that relief for such Tax loss is given against the profits of, or the
          liability to Tax of, the Claimant Company;

                                       71
<PAGE>

     (ii) no Surrendering Company shall alter or amend any claims or any other
          arrangements for the surrender or allocation of any Tax loss (or the
          terms thereof) made by the Vendor or any company in the same group of
          companies for the purposes of any Tax as the Vendor or any
          Surrendering Company in respect of any tax period ending on or prior
          to the Completion Date, whether or not the arrangements for, or the
          payments for, such claims, surrenders or allocations were made before,
          on or after Completion.

Part B of Schedule 4 - Completion Statement Principles

The Accounting Principles to be used in the preparation of the Completion
Statement in respect of the Adjustment Items must be consistent with accounting
principles reflected in the notes to the Accounts, subject to the specific
principles set out below:

(a)   no new provisions or accruals will be recognised in the Completion
      Statement to the extent they relate to matters reasonably
      ascertainable from the Disclosures;

(b)   for the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment is to be made to the
      carrying value of any brands, trademarks or licences or other
      intangible assets;

(c)   any provisions recorded against inventories will be calculated on
      the same basis as the provisions in the Accounts;

(d)   for the avoidance of doubt, no provisions for redundancies will be
      made;

(e)   inventories will be valued on the same basis as they are valued in
      the Accounts;

(f)   the movement in the income tax payable will only reflect any
      payments of tax, an allowance for income tax on taxable income
      derived since the Accounts Date, and any change in circumstances as
      a result of lodging an income tax return or receiving an amended
      assessment, in the period from the Accounts Date;

(g)   no new reserves will be reflected other than those reflected in the
      Accounts; and

(h)   The economic value of the electricity derivatives, including
      Standard Swaps, Load Following Margin Sharing Swaps, Swaptions,
      Standard Caps, Demand Triggered Caps, Callable Caps, Asian Options,
      and SFE Futures, but not including the Ecogen Master Hedge
      Agreement (the "Electricity Hedge Book") of the Group Companies as
      of 31 December 2003 was $132,688,000. The Electricity Hedge Book at
      Completion will be valued on the same basis and in accordance with
      the same principles and methodologies as employed by the Group
      Companies to determine the economic value of the Electricity Hedge
      Book as of 31 December 2003. The principles and methodologies to be
      used to determine the economic value of the Electricity Hedge Book
      at Completion follow in Part C of this Schedule 4.

(i)   Cash in relation to customer contributions and contractor deposits
      shall be included as part of the Working Capital calculation.

Part C of Schedule 4 - TXU Economic Valuation of Electricity Hedge Book

Swaps held in IntegraT

Inputs

Daily AFMA prices as published by email to TXU using field "median excluding
outliers" peak and off peak prices for each node.

Prices are input into MtM system (TXUA developed and operated system coded in
SQL back-end, Access / VBA front-end accessed as \\cashew\local-utils\m2m.mdb)
and "bootstrap" algorithm is applied. Bootstrapping method processes
"overlapping" raw AFMA prices (eg Jan, Feb and Q1) to derive implied prices (eg
Mar) and thus produces a contiguous monthly peak and off peak price series by
node.



Example of Forward Curve





Contract schedules are sourced from IntegraT into MtM system. Contract volumes
and prices are converted from the raw contract schedules into monthly peak and
off peak volumes and volume weighted average prices by peak / off peak segment,
using a day type mapping held in IntegraT.
A version is created to lock in bootstrapped forward prices and unexpired
contracts as at a point in time. Versions are stored in the MtM System to allow
recreation of historical financial positions.

                                      111
<PAGE>

Valuation Methodology

        Value =  [(forward Price - Strike Price) * Volume]* (+1) if bought

                                (or - 1 if sold)

Where

Forward Price = bootstrapped AFMA price

Strike Price = averaged contract price

Volume = contract volume (MWh)

Calculation is performed for each contract and each month, peak and off peak
combination.


Outputs


Mark to market value is stored for a version for each contract, peak and off
peak combination.


Likely Changes in next 3 Months


The following inputs would normally be expected to change between any two
valuation dates:

     o   AFMA prices

     o   Existing contract positions will roll off.

     o   New positions will be added.

Changes to other parameters or methodology would occur only by mutual agreement
of Vendor and Purchaser.


Standard (fixed volume) half hourly caps


Inputs

AFMA forward swap prices by region - bootstrapped. Where cap term extends beyond
AFMA price curve, the last relevant AFMA price is replicated to extend the
forward curve on a straight line basis.

                                      112
<PAGE>

Cap contract volumes, commencement and maturity dates, strike prices are drawn
from IntegraT tables

Cap contract premiums (premium amounts by contract by payment month) are
provided by Energy Finance Group and held in manually updated local tables
within the Risk and Compliance group's cap and option valuation and counterparty
credit exposure measurement model (an Access application constructed and
operated by TXUA Risk and Compliance and accessed via \\almond\trading\Risk &
Business Systems\Risk\Models&Tools\Mark-to-Market\Credit Exposure.mdb)

Valuation parameters [OBJECT OMITTED]("Slope") & [OBJECT OMITTED] ("Intercept")
for each standard strike price level are fixed model parameters based on
historical analysis of cap payoffs:

Methodology

Valuation formula:


where


V is the value of an annual cap (in $/MWh)
F is the forward annual swap price ($/MWh) (ie bootstrapped AFMA price)
aK is a parameter dependant on the cap strike price (K)
aK is a parameter dependant on the cap strike price (K)
K is the cap strike price
[OBJECT OMITTED] is a discount factor, to convert the future monthly values (at
time t) to the present
o is the volatility of average annual spot prices about the annual forward swap
price (model parameter, fixed at 40%)
N(z) is the cumulative probability density of a standard Normal variate z

Fixed parameters (derived from front office judgement) are then used to allocate
an annual cap value to individual months of a year.

Premiums are considered on a cash basis and allocated to the month in which they
occur.

Model parameters are independent of NEM region

Outputs

Contract economic valuation as at valuation date, broken down by peak / offpeak
segment and forward month. These are stored by valuation date and contract

Likely Changes in Next 3 Months

The following inputs would normally be expected to change between any two
valuation dates:

    o  AFMA prices

    o  Existing contract positions will roll off.

    o  Scheduled premium payments will be settled

Changes to other parameters or methodology would occur only by mutual agreement
of Vendor and Purchaser.

Swaptions

Inputs

AFMA forward swap prices by region - bootstrapped.

Historical volatility of forward swap prices - calculated from time series
analysis of AFMA forward swap prices.

Swaption underlying contract volumes, commencement and maturity dates, and
strike prices are drawn from IntegraT tables

Swaption type (Put or Call), premiums, and exercise dates are provided from a
register maintained by Energy Finance Group are and held in manually updated
local tables within the Risk and Compliance group's valuation model ["Credit
Exposure.mdb"]

Methodology

Valuation formula:

Swaptions are valued using the Black-76 option pricing formula


where


                                      117
<PAGE>

with
V is the value of the option (in $/MWh)
F is the price of the underlying forward swap ($/MWh)
K is the swaption strike price ($/MWh)
r is the risk-free rate (fixed 5%pa)
T-t is time left to the exercise date
oF is the volatility of the underlying forward swap
N(z) is the cumulative probability density of a standard Normal variate z

The exposure is attributed to the month of the exercise date.

Premiums are prepaid under current market practice and therefore do not enter
economic valuation.

Forward swap volatilities are calculated from historical time series analysis of
daily AFMA forward prices using routines in the "Statistics.mdb" database
maintained by TXUA Risk and Compliance.

Implementation:

"Credit Exposure.mdb" Access application constructed and operated by TXUA Risk
and Compliance.

Outputs

Swaption economic valuation as at valuation date, attributed to month of
exercise. These are stored by valuation date and contract within the
Counterparty Exposure model.

Likely Changes in Next 3 Months

The following inputs would normally be expected to change between any two
valuation dates:

   o     AFMA prices
   o     Measured historical volatilities
   o     Existing contract positions may roll off due to exercise or lapse
         of option.
   o     New positions may be added.

Changes to other parameters or methodology would occur only by mutual agreement
of Vendor and Purchaser.

Asian Options

Inputs

AFMA forward swap prices by region - bootstrapped.

Historical volatility of forward swap prices - calculated from time series
analysis of AFMA forward swap prices.

Assumed volatility os of average spot price around corresponding forward price,
fixed model parameter of 40%.

Asian option contract volumes, commencement and maturity dates, are drawn from
IntegraT tables

Option type (Put or Call), premiums, averaging periods and strike prices per
averaging period are provided from a register maintained by Energy Finance Group
are and held in manually updated local tables within the Risk and Compliance
group's valuation model ["Credit Exposure.mdb"]

Methodology

Valuation formula:

Asian Options are valued using the "Black-Collier" option pricing formula
developed by TXUA



where



with
V is the value of the option (in $/MWh)
F is the price of the underlying forward swap ($/MWh)
K is the swaption strike price ($/MWh)
r is the risk-free rate (fixed 5% pa)
TStart is the start of the averaging period
TEnd is the end of the averaging period

                                      119
<PAGE>

t is the current date
oF is the volatility of the price of the
underlying forward swap covering the averaging period
os is the assumed volatility of the average spot price around the forward price
for the averaging period and is fixed at 40% for all averaging periods and
regions
otot is the total volatility for the asian option
N(z) is the cumulative probability density of a standard Normal variate z

Each contractual averaging period is valued separately and the results
aggregated. Value is attributed to the month after the end of the averaging
period. Premiums are considered on a cash basis are allocated to the month in
which they occur.

Forward swap volatilities are identical to those used and described above for
swaption valuation.

Implementation:

"Credit Exposures.mdb" Access application constructed and operated by TXUA Risk
and Compliance.

Outputs
Asian economic valuation as at valuation date, attributed to the month following
each averaging period. These are stored by valuation date and contract within
the Counterparty Exposure model.

Likely Changes in Next 3 Months

The following inputs would normally be expected to change between any two
valuation dates:

   o     AFMA prices
   o     Measured historical volatilities
   o     Existing contract positions may roll off due to expiry of averaging
         periods.
   o     New positions may be added.

Changes to other parameters or methodology would occur only by mutual agreement
of Vendor and Purchaser.

SFE Futures

SFE Futures are entered into IntegraT deal capture system for position tracking
purposes and are economically essentially equivalent to swap contracts for the
relevant quarter and load shape (peak or off-peak). The MtM system described
above for swaps valuation to be used to value futures contracts against AFMA
swap prices.

However the valuation process followed by Energy Finance Group based on daily
SFE settlement prices may be adopted by mutual agreement.

                                   Schedule 9

                                 Vendor Opinions

Legal opinions (subject to customary assumptions, exclusions and
qualifications), to be provided by one or more counsel for the Vendor at
Completion:

(a)          The Vendor and the Company are duly organized and validly existing
             under the laws of their respective jurisdictions of incorporation.
             The Company has the corporate power and authority to conduct its
             business as it is presently being conducted, and to own, operate
             and lease its assets.

(b)          The Vendor has the corporate power and authority to enter into and
             perform its obligations under the Agreement. The execution,
             delivery and performance of the Agreement, and the consummation of
             the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by
             all necessary corporate action on the part of the Vendor. The
             Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Vendor, and
             the Agreement constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
             Vendor, enforceable against the Vendor in accordance with its
             respective terms, except to the extent that enforcement is limited
             by the insolvency laws or principles of public policy.

(c)          The execution and delivery of the Agreement and the consummation of
             the transactions contemplated thereby, including, without
             limitation, the redemption of the Company Preferred Stock and the
             conversion of the Company into a Delaware limited liability
             company, do not (i) result in a breach or violation of any
             provision of the organizational documents of Vendor or the Company
             or (ii) result in a violation of any applicable U.S. statute, rule
             or regulation.

(d)          All of the issued and outstanding membership interests in the
             Company are owned of record by the Vendor. All of the membership
             interests of the Company have been duly authorized and validly
             issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. To the best of our
             knowledge, there are no contracts relating to the issuance, sale,
             voting, redemption or transfer of the membership interests of the
             Company.

(e)          Upon delivery to the Purchaser of certificates evidencing the Sale
             Shares endorsed to the Purchaser or in blank and payment therefor
             by the Purchaser pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchaser will
             acquire the Sale Shares free of any adverse claim under the Uniform
             Commercial Code in effect in the State of Delaware. In rendering
             the foregoing opinion such counsel may assume that the Purchaser
             takes delivery of the Sale Shares without notice of any adverse
             claim and that any endorsement is effective.

(f)          Except as to section 9(a)(2), 32 and 33 of the Public Utility
             Holding Company Act of 1935 ("PUHCA"), each of the Vendor, and each
             Group Company, is not subject to, or is exempt from, regulation as
             an "electric utility company", a "gas utility company", a
             "public-utility company", a "holding company" or a "subsidiary
             company" of a "holding company", as such terms are defined within
             the meaning of PUHCA.

                                      140

(g)          Each Group Company that owns or operates facilities used for:
             (a) the generation, transmission, or distribution of electric
             energy for sale (other than sale to tenants or to employees of the
             company operating such facilities for their own use and not for
             resale), or (b) the distribution at retail of natural or
             manufactured gas for heat, light or power (other than distribution
             only in enclosed portable containers, or distribution to tenants
             or employees of the company operating such facilities for their
             own use and not fore resale), is either a "foreign utility company"
             ("FUCO") within the meaning of Section 33 of PUHCA and the
             regulations promulgated thereunder, or an exempt wholesale
             generator ("EWG") within the meaning of Section 32 of PUHCA and
             the regulations promulgated thereunder (together such Group
             Companies that are FUCOs or EWGs are referred to as the
             "PUHCA-Exempt Group Companies").

(h)          Each of the PUHCA-Exempt Group Companies has filed or caused to be
             filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission
             ("SEC") (in the case of PUHCA Exempt Group Companies that are
             FUCOs) or the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
             (in the case of PUHCA Exempt Group Companies that are EWGs), all
             material forms, statements, reports and documents (including all
             exhibits, amendments and supplements thereto) required to be filed
             to maintain status as a FUCO or EWG, as applicable.

             power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under
             the Share Sale Agreement to which it is a party and has taken all
             necessary corporate action to authorise the execution of the Share
             Sale Agreement.

(d)          The Share Sale Agreement constitutes valid and legally binding

             that such laws apply thereto and to the extent that the Share Sale
             Agreement is otherwise valid, legally binding and enforceable on
             the relevant parties.

             to companies generally.

(f)          It is not necessary:

             (i)   in order to ensure the validity, enforceability or
