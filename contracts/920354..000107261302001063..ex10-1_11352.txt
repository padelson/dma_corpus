merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "Merger") on the terms and
conditions set forth herein and in accordance with the provisions of the
Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Act");

            WHEREAS, the board of directors of the Company has recommended the
approval and adoption of this Agreement to its shareholders;

            WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub, the Company and the Principal desire to
make certain representations and warranties and other agreements in connection
with the Merger;

            WHEREAS, the parties intend that the Merger should constitute a
taxable transaction and should not qualify as a plan of reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the

Preferred Stock of the Company will be converted into shares of Common Stock of
the Company, (ii) the outstanding subordinated convertible notes of the Company
(the "Subordinated Notes") in the aggregate principal amount plus accrued
interest of approximately $12.7 million will be exchanged or converted into
shares of Common Stock of the Company, and (iii) the Company will file a
Certificate of Amendment to Certificate of Incorporation (the "Certificate of
Amendment") to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock of the
Company in order to accommodate the issuance of shares of Common Stock
contemplated by (i) and (ii) above (collectively, the "Recapitalization").

Representative and the Principal hereby agree as follows:

            2.3 CONVERSION OF STOCK.

                  2.3.1 STOCK OF THE COMPANY. Subject to Section 2.4 and Section
2.7, at the Effective Time, each share of Common Stock of the Company issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any Dissenting
Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof (each such holder being hereinafter referred to as a
"Shareholder" and, collectively, as the "Shareholders") be converted into and
become .00022104 shares of the Common Stock of Parent amounting in the aggregate
to 1,100,000 shares of Common Stock of Parent ("Parent Stock"). Each share of
Parent Stock issued pursuant to the Merger shall be validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable.

                  2.3.2 STOCK OF MERGER SUB. At the Effective Time, each share
of the Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of Merger Sub ("Merger Sub

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of Common Stock, par value $.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

                  2.3.3 DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary and unless otherwise provided by applicable law,
shares of capital stock of the Company that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by Shareholders who
have properly demanded payment of the fair value of their stock (the "Dissenting
Shares") within the meaning of Section 262 of the Act shall not be converted
into the right to receive shares of Parent Stock pursuant to Section 2.3.1 above
unless and until such Shareholders shall have failed to perfect or shall have
effectively withdrawn their demand, or lost their right of payment under
applicable law. If any such Shareholder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of payment, each share of capital
stock held by such Shareholder shall thereupon be deemed converted into the
right to receive and exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, shares of Parent
Stock pursuant to Section 2.3.1 of this Agreement. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at and after the Effective Time, any holder of
shares of capital stock who complies with Section 262 of the Act (a "Dissenting
Shareholder") shall be entitled to obtain payment from the Surviving Corporation
of the fair value of such Dissenting Shareholder's shares of capital stock as
determined pursuant to the Act; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, to the extent
permissible under the Act, no such payment shall be made unless and until such
Dissenting Shareholder has surrendered to the Parent the certificate
representing the shares of capital stock for which payment is being made.

                  2.3.4 PROCEDURE WITH RESPECT TO DISSENTING SHARES. The Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notice of intent to demand
payment for shares filed pursuant to Section 262 of the Act received by the
Company, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served in
connection with such notices pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Act and
received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such notices under the Act consistent with the
obligations of the Company thereunder. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld), (A)
make any payment with respect to any such notice, (B) offer to settle or settle
any such notices or (C) waive any failure to timely deliver a written notice in
accordance with the Act.

received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of:

                  (i)   such fraction, multiplied by

                  (ii)  the average closing price of a share of Parent Stock for
                        the ten most recent days that Parent Stock has traded
                        ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
                        Effective Time, as reported by the Nasdaq National
                        Market (the "Parent Stock Value").

                  (b) No number of shares of Parent Stock less than 100 shares
will be issued to any individual Shareholder by virtue of the Merger, but in
lieu thereof each Shareholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
number of shares of Parent Stock (after aggregating all shares of Parent Stock
or fractions thereof to be received by such holder) that is less than 100 shall
receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of (i) such number of shares, multiplied by (ii) the Parent
Stock Value.

                  (c) Unless Parent otherwise elects, no shares of Parent Stock
will be issued to any Shareholder who at the Effective Time has not either (i)
executed and delivered the Registration Agreement or (ii) otherwise established
to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that he is an "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act (each a
"Non-Accredited Stockholder"), but in lieu thereof, each such Non-Accredited
Stockholder who would otherwise be entitled to receive a number of shares of
Parent Stock shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Parent
Stock that such Non-Accredited Stockholder would otherwise be entitled to
receive (after aggregating all shares of Parent Stock or fractions thereof to be
received by such holder) multiplied by (ii) the Parent Stock Value.

            2.5 ISSUANCE OF PARENT STOCK. Subject to Section 2.7, at and after
the Effective Time, upon surrender to Parent by each Shareholder of certificates
for the number of shares of Common Stock representing all of the shares of
Common Stock owned by such Shareholder, Parent shall issue and deliver to each
such Shareholder a certificate which shall be registered in the name of such
Shareholder and shall bear appropriate legends, and which together shall
represent the total number of shares of Parent Stock into which such
Shareholder's Common Stock has been converted.

            2.6 CLOSING. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Parent in Bedford, Massachusetts as soon as practicable
(but in any case shall not later two (2) business days) after the latest to

            2.7 ESCROW FUND.

                  (a) When making the issuances of Parent Common Stock pursuant
to Section 2.5 above, Parent shall withhold from the Shareholders a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to twenty percent (20%) of the number of
Shares (rounded down to the nearest Share) included in the Merger Consideration
(the "Escrow Shares"). At the Closing, Parent shall deliver the Escrow Shares to
a bank or trust company selected by Parent and the Shareholders' Representative
(the "Escrow Agent"), to be held by the Escrow Agent or its nominee pursuant to
the provisions of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit B
(the "Escrow Agreement"). The Escrow Shares will be represented by a certificate
or certificates issued in the name of the Escrow Agent.

                  (b) When making the cash payments pursuant to Section 2.4(c)
above, Parent shall withhold from such payments an amount equal to twenty
percent (20%) of the aggregate amont of such payments (the "Non-Accredited Cash
Portion"). When paying the Transaction Bonuses or Earn-Out Amount to certain
employees of the Company, as more fully described in Section 5.5 below, Parent
shall withhold from such payments an amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of the
aggregate amount of such payments (the "Management Escrow Portion"; the
Management Escrow Portion together with the Non-Accredited Cash Portion shall be
referred to as the "Escrow Cash"; the Escrow Cash together with the Escrow
Shares shall be referred to collectively as the "Escrow Fund"). At the Closing,
Parent shall deliver the Escrow Cash to the Escrow Agent to be held by the
Escrow Agent pursuant to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.

                  (c) Twenty-five percent (25%) of the total Escrow Fund shall
be segregated from the rest of the Escrow Fund and shall be deposited in and
held as a separate escrow account that will be held solely to satisfy
indemnification claims for inaccuracies of the representations set forth in
Section 3.25 and Schedule 3.25 hereof in accordance with Article 8 and the
Escrow Agreement (the "Section 3.25 Escrow Account"). Subject to the next
sentence, the Section 3.25 Escrow Account shall be released and delivered to the
Shareholders and the Executives as their interests therein may appear on
September 30, 2003 (the "Section 3.25 Escrow Period"). In the event any member
of the Parent Group has made a claim pursuant to Article 8 against the Section
3.25 Escrow Account prior to the end of the Section 3.25 Escrow Period, then the
Escrow Agent will continue to retain in escrow a portion of the Section 3.25
Escrow Account sufficient to cover the amount of such claim until such claim is
fully and finally resolved (and shall release the remainder of the Section 3.25
Escrow Account at the end of the Section 3.25 Escrow Period) in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement. The Parent Group may recover against the entire Escrow
Fund with respect to such indemnification claims, and is not limited to the
Section 3.25 Escrow Account.

                  (d) Subject to Section 2.7(e), the Escrow Fund other than the
Section 3.25 Escrow Account (the "General Escrow Fund") shall be held by the
Escrow Agent until the second anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Escrow
Period"); provided that on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, the
excess, if any, of the General Escrow Fund over two-thirds (2/3) of the
aggregate amount initially deposited in the General Escrow Fund (including any
additional amounts contributed pursuant to Section 5.5) shall be released to the
Shareholders and

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

the Executives in accordance with their respective interests therein, with the
remainder being held until the second anniversary of the Closing.

                  (e) In the event any member of the Parent Group has made a
claim under Article 8 prior to the end of the Escrow Period, then the Escrow
Agent will continue to retain in escrow a portion of the General Escrow Fund
sufficient to cover the amount of such claim until such claim is fully and
finally resolved (and shall release the remainder of the General Escrow Fund at
the end of the Escrow Period) in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

                  (f) Any payments made out of the Escrow Fund for Parent Claims
shall be paid first with the Management Escrow Portion in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement. After the Management Escrow Portion has been paid out in full,
further payments out of the Escrow Fund for Parent Claims shall be made using
the Escrow Shares (including the cash proceeds from the sale of any Escrow
Shares) and the Non-Accredited Cash Portion in accordance with the Escrow
Agreement.

                  (g) In the event that this Agreement is approved by the
Shareholders of the Company pursuant to Section 251 of the Act, then each
Shareholder shall, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and his
receipt of any Merger Consideration, and without any further act of such
Shareholder, be deemed to have consented to and approved the use of the Escrow
Fund to satisfy any Parent Claims by members of the Parent Group in the manner
set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement.

            2.8 SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE.

the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and his receipt of any Merger
Consideration and without any further act of such Shareholder, and each
Executive by executing and delivering the Transaction Bonus Agreements and in
accordance with the terms thereof and without any further act of such Executive,
hereby irrevocably appoint the Shareholders' Representative as their agent and

of the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by the Parent Group); (iii) to take
all action necessary in connection with the defense and/or settlement of any

during the time that property remains in the Escrow Fund, to give and receive
all notices required to be given under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
the Registration Agreement.

                  (c) In the event that the Shareholder's Representative dies,
is unable or becomes unable to perform his responsibilities hereunder or resigns
from such position, the remaining Shareholders shall, by election of the
Shareholders (or, if applicable, their respective heirs, legal representatives,
successors and assigns) who held a majority of the shares of Common Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, select another
representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted representative shall be
deemed to be the Shareholders' Representative for all purposes of this
Agreement.

                  (d) All decisions and actions by the Shareholders'
Representative, including actions under the Registration Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement and the defense or settlement of any Parent Claims for which the
Shareholders may be required to indemnify members of the Parent Group pursuant
to Article 8 hereof (but only with respect to Parent Claims payable solely out
of the Escrow Fund), shall be binding upon all of the Shareholders, and no
Shareholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest or otherwise
contest the same.

                  (e) Each Shareholder, by virtue of the Merger and his receipt
of any Merger Consideration, and each Executive, by executing and delivering the
Transaction Bonus Agreements, shall be deemed to have agreed, that:

                        (i) Parent shall be able to rely conclusively on the
instructions and decisions of the Shareholders' Representative relating to the
registration of the Parent Stock or to the settlement of any Parent Claims for
indemnification by members of the Parent Group pursuant to Article 8 hereof and
the Escrow Agreement or any other actions permitted or required to be taken by
the Shareholders' Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder shall have
any cause of action against any member of the Parent Group for any action taken
by any member of the Parent Group in reliance upon the instructions or decisions
of the Shareholders' Representative;

                        (ii) all actions, decisions and instructions of the
Shareholders' Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon all of the
Shareholders and the Executives and no Shareholder or Executive shall have any
cause of action against the Shareholders' Representative for any action taken or
not taken, decision made or instruction given by the Shareholders'
Representative under this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except for fraud or
willful breach of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement by the Shareholders'
Representative;

                        (iii) the provisions of this Section 2.8 are independent
and severable, are irrevocable and coupled with an interest and shall be
enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Shareholder or
Executive may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

                        (iv) the provisions of this Section 2.8 shall be binding
upon the heirs, legal representatives, successors and assigns of each
Shareholder and Executive, and any references in this Agreement to a Shareholder
or the Shareholders shall mean and include the successors to the Shareholders'
rights hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of

disposition, the laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

                  (f) Parent shall have no liability for any fees or expenses of
the Shareholders' Representative. The reasonable expenses incurred by the
Shareholders' Representative while acting on behalf of the Shareholders under
the authorization granted in this Section 2.8 shall be borne by the Shareholders
pro rata and shall be payable out of the Escrow Fund; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
the aggregate amount of any payments to the Shareholders' Representative out of
the Escrow Fund pursuant to this Section 2.8(f) shall not exceed $10,000. Parent
shall be entitled, without making any inquiry as to the validity or amount of
the fees or expenses to be reimbursed, to rely on the written instructions of
the Shareholders' Representative regarding payments in respect of the
Shareholders' Representative's fees and expenses as conclusive evidence of the
Shareholders' Representative right to receive such amounts.

            2.9 TRANSFERS OF OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of Parent
Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the certificate
surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the
issuance thereof that (a) the certificate so surrendered will be properly
endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Shareholder
requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of issuance of a certificate for
shares of Parent Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the certificate surrendered, or established to the reasonable satisfaction of
Parent or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not
payable, (b) Parent will have received an opinion, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and its counsel, of counsel which (to Parent's
reasonable satisfaction) is knowledgeable in securities laws matters, to the
effect that such issuance of a certificate for shares of Parent Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the certificate surrendered may
be effected without registration under the Securities Act and qualification
under any applicable state securities laws and (c) the party in whose name the
certificate will be issued has signed the Registration Agreement and any other
necessary ancillary agreements.

omission from the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to constitute a
breach or inaccuracy of this representation only to the extent that the omitted
conflict, violation, breach, default or right of acceleration would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. No authorization, consent
or approval of, or filing with or notice to, any United States or foreign

generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") consistently applied (except
as otherwise stated therein and subject, in the case of any unaudited interim

property taxes, and any other taxes, assessments or similar charges in the

disputed or not.

            3.11 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

                  3.11.1 LIST OF PLANS. Section 3.11 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule contains a correct and complete list of all pension, profit sharing,
retirement, deferred compensation, welfare, legal services, medical, dental or
other employee benefit or health insurance plans, life insurance or other death
benefit plans, disability, stock option, stock purchase, stock compensation,
bonus, vacation pay, severance pay and other similar plans, programs or
agreements, and every material personnel policy, relating to any persons
employed by the Company or in which any person employed by the Company is
eligible to participate and which is currently maintained or that was maintained
at any time in the last five calendar years by the Company (collectively, the
"Company Plans"). The Company has provided or made available to Parent complete
copies, as of the date hereof, of all of the Company Plans that have been
reduced to writing, together with all documents establishing or constituting any
related trust, annuity contract, insurance contract or other funding instrument,
and summaries of those that have not been reduced to writing. The Company has
provided or made available to Parent complete copies of current plan summaries,
employee booklets, personnel manuals and other material documents or written
materials concerning the Company Plans, as well as copies of the most recent
annual reports (Form 5500 series, including all schedules thereto), if
applicable, for the Company Plans. The Company does not have any "defined
benefit plans" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA.

                  3.11.2 ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of
the Company has incurred any "withdrawal liability" calculated under Section
4211 of ERISA and there has been no event or circumstance which would cause them
to incur any such liability. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of the
Company has ever maintained a Company Plan providing health or life insurance
benefits to former employees, other than as required pursuant to Section 4980B
of the Code or state law. No pension plan previously maintained by the Company
or its ERISA Affiliates which was subject to ERISA has been terminated; no
proceedings to terminate any such plan have been instituted within the meaning
of Subtitle C of Title IV of ERISA; and no reportable event within the meaning
of Section 4043 of said Subtitle C of Title IV of ERISA with respect to which
the requirement to file a notice with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
has not been waived has occurred with respect to any such Company Plan, and no
liability to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has been incurred by the
Company or its ERISA Affiliates. With respect to all the Company Plans, the
Company and every ERISA Affiliate of the Company are in material compliance with
all requirements prescribed by all statutes, regulations, orders or rules
currently in effect, and have in all material respects performed all obligations
required to be performed by them. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate of
the Company, nor any of their directors, officers, employees or agents,

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

nor any trustee or administrator of any trust created under the Company Plans,
has engaged in or been a party to any "prohibited transaction" as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA which could subject the
Company or its Affiliates, directors or employees or the Company Plans or the
trusts relating thereto or any party dealing with any of the Company Plans or
trusts to any material tax or material penalty on "prohibited transactions"
imposed by Section 4975 of the Code. Neither the Company Plans nor the trusts
created thereunder have incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such
term is defined in Section 412 of the Code and regulations issued thereunder,
whether or not waived.

                  3.11.3 PLAN DETERMINATIONS. Each Company Plan intended to
qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has been determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to so qualify, and the trusts created thereunder have been
determined to be exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code; copies of all
determination letters have been delivered to the Company; and nothing has
occurred since the date of such determination letters which might cause the loss
of such qualification or exemption. With respect to each Company Plan which is a
qualified profit sharing plan, all employer contributions accrued for plan years
ending prior to the Closing under the Company Plan terms and applicable law have
been made.

                  3.11.4 FUNDING. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.11 hereto:

                        (a) all contributions, premiums or other payments due or
required to be made to the Company Plans as of the Effective Time have been made
as of the Effective Time or are properly reflected on the Company Balance Sheet;

                        (b) there are no actions, liens, suits or claims pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company or the Principal, threatened (other than
routine claims for benefits) with respect to any Company Plan;

                        (c) no event has occurred, and there exists no condition
or set of circumstances, which presents a material risk of a partial termination
(within the meaning of Section 411(d)(3) of the Code) of any Company Plan;

                        (d) each Company Plan that is a "group health plan" (as
defined in Section 607(1) of ERISA) has been operated at all times in
substantial compliance with the provisions of COBRA and any applicable, similar
state law;

                        (e) the consummation of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not: (1) entitle any current or
former employee of the Company to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
any similar payment, (2) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of any compensation due to, any current or former employee of the
Company, (3) constitute or involve a "prohibited transaction" as defined in
Section 4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA, constitute or involve a
breach of fiduciary responsibility within the meaning of Section 502(1) of ERISA
or otherwise violate Part 4 of Title I of ERISA or (4) result in the payment of
compensation that would, in combination with any other payment, result in an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code;
and

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

                        (f) with respect to any Company Plan that is qualified
under Section 401(k) of the Code, individually and in the aggregate, no event
has occurred, and to the knowledge of the Company or the Principal, there exists
no condition or set of circumstances in connection with which the Company could
be subject to any liability that is reasonably likely to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect (except liability for benefits claims and funding obligations
payable in the ordinary course) under ERISA, the Code or any other applicable
law.

            3.12  EMPLOYMENT-RELATED MATTERS.

                  3.12.1 LABOR RELATIONS. The Company is not a party to any
collective bargaining agreement or other contract or agreement with any labor

effectuated any layoffs of employees or implemented any early retirement or
separation program at any time since its inception, nor has the Company planned
or announced any such action or program for the future with respect to which the
Company has any liability. All salaries, wages, vacation pay, bonuses,
commissions and other compensation payable by the Company to the employees of

severance, if any. The Employee List is correct and complete as of the date of
the Employee List, and is correct and complete as of the date hereof, except for
changes since that date that are not material in the aggregate or individually.
No third party has asserted any claim, or, to the knowledge of the Company or
the Principal, has any reasonable basis to assert any valid claim, against the
Company that either the continued employment by, or association with, the
Company of any of the present officers or employees of, or consultants to, the
Company contravenes any agreements or laws applicable to unfair competition,
trade secrets or proprietary information.

Company is in compliance in all material respects with all of the terms of such
Permits and authorizations, and no other Permits or authorizations are required

the Principal, there are no past or present actions or activities by the
Company, or any circumstances, conditions, events or incidents, including the

retained or assumed either contractually or by operation of law.

            3.14 NO BROKER'S OR FINDER'S FEES. The Company has not paid or

                  3.15.1 TITLE. The Company has good and marketable title to all
of the tangible assets shown on the Company Balance Sheet, in each case, free

                  3.15.2 CONDITION. All receivables shown on the Company Balance

Balance Sheet, represent valid obligations of customers of the Company arising

Company has not received any notice in writing from or regarding any account
debtor indicating their inability or unwillingness to pay. All of the material
computer equipment owned or leased by the Company and regularly used in its

            3.16 REAL PROPERTY.

of the parties thereto in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the
Equitable Qualifications; except as set forth on Schedule 3.16 of the Company

of delivery of a copy thereof to Parent. Neither the Company nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any other party to a Company Lease, has committed a
material breach or default under any Company Lease, nor has there occurred any
event that with the passage of time or the giving of notice or both would
constitute such a breach or default, nor are there any facts or circumstances

breach or default thereunder. Section 3.16 of the Company Disclosure Schedule
identifies each Company Lease that requires the consent of any third party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and all such consents have
been obtained. No material construction, alteration or other leasehold

code and object code form), and tangible or intangible proprietary information
or material, that have been used in the business of the Company or that are used
in the business of the Company as currently conducted or as currently proposed
to be conducted by the Company (the "Company Proprietary Rights"). Except as set
forth on Schedule 3.17, there is no reason why the Company will not be able to
continue to use all Company Proprietary Rights necessary for the lawful conduct
of its business as currently conducted and as currently proposed to be
conducted, without any infringement or conflict with the rights of others.
Except as set forth on Schedule 3.17, all of the Company's rights in and to the
Company Proprietary Rights are owned by the Company, free and clear of
Encumbrances, or if not so owned, are licensed to the Company and, if so

royalties or other compensation to any third party in respect of its ownership,
use or license of any of the Company Proprietary Rights.

                  3.17.4 LICENSES. Set forth on Section 3.17 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule is a complete list of all licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements as to which the Company is a party (excluding End-User Licenses) and
pursuant to which (a) any third party is authorized to use any Company
Proprietary Right or (b) the Company uses, distributes or sublicenses any
intellectual property of any third party (excluding Commercial Software) that is
used in the development, marketing or support of, or that is incorporated in,
the Company's products. Section 3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule includes
the identity of all parties to each such license, sublicense or other agreement,
a description of the nature and subject matter thereof, the applicable royalty
and the term thereof. The Company Proprietary Rights include all patents,
trademarks, trade names, service marks, trade secrets and software that are
necessary for the Company to satisfy and perform such licenses, sublicenses and
agreements. The Company is not in violation of any license, sublicense or
agreement described on such list except such violations as do not materially
impair the Company's rights under such license, sublicense or agreement. Such
licenses, sublicenses and agreements are in full force and effect and, to the
knowledge of the Company and the Principal with respect to parties other than
the Company, are binding and enforceable against each of the parties thereto in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to the Equitable Qualifications.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not cause the Company
to be in material violation or default under any such license, sublicense or
agreement, nor entitle any other party to any such license, sublicense or
agreement to terminate or modify such license, sublicense or agreement.

                  3.17.5 STATUS OF REGISTRATIONS. All of the Company Proprietary
Rights set forth on Schedule 3.17 as having been issued by, registered with or
filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("PTO") or Register of
Copyrights or the corresponding offices of other countries listed on Section
3.17 of the Company Disclosure Schedule have been so duly issued by or
registered with (based on certificates or other written documents that the
Company has received from such office, register or other offices) or, duly filed
in, as the case may be, and have been properly maintained and renewed in
accordance with all applicable provisions of law and administrative regulations
in the United States and each such other country. The Company has taken
reasonable precautions (i) to protect its rights in the Company Proprietary
Rights and (ii) to maintain the confidentiality of its trade secrets, pending
patent applications (to the extent any such applications are considered by the
PTO to be confidential), know-how and other confidential Company Proprietary
Rights, and there have been no acts or omissions by the officers, directors and
shareholders of the Company or, to the knowledge of the Company or the
Principal, any other employee of the Company, the result of which would be to
compromise the rights of the Company to apply for or enforce appropriate legal
protection of such Company Proprietary Rights. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company's products, packaging and documentation contain
appropriate copyright notices.

                  3.17.6 NO CONFLICT. No claims with respect to the Company
Proprietary Rights have been asserted, and, to the knowledge of the Company,
neither are any threatened by any Person nor are there any valid grounds for any
bona fide claims (a) to the effect that the development, sale, licensing or use
of any of the products of the Company as now developed, sold or licensed or used
or proposed for development, use, sale or licensing by the Company infringes on
any copyright, patent, trademark, service mark or trade secret, (b) against the
use by the Company of any trademarks, service marks, trade names, trade secrets,
copyrights, patents, technology, know-how or computer software programs and
applications used in the Company's business as currently conducted or as
proposed to be conducted by the Company, or (c) challenging the ownership by the
Company, validity or effectiveness of any of the Company Proprietary Rights. To
the knowledge of the Company there is no unauthorized use, infringement or
misappropriation of any of the Company Proprietary Rights by any third party,
including any employee or former employee of the Company. No Company Proprietary

                  3.18.2 VALIDITY. All contracts, leases, instruments, licenses
and other agreements or documents described on Section 3.18 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule are valid and in full force and effect and the Company has
not, nor, to the knowledge of the Company or the Principal, has any other party
thereto, breached any provision of, or defaulted under the terms of any such
contract, lease, instrument, license or other agreement or document. Section
3.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each agreement and other
document set forth on Section 3.18 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or
disclosed by the Company on another part of the Company Disclosure Schedule that
requires the consent of a third party in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

            3.19 INSURANCE CONTRACTS. Section 3.19 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule lists all contracts of insurance in force at the date hereof with
respect to the Company. Such contracts of insurance (collectively, the "Company
Insurance Contracts") insure against such risks, and are in such amounts, as are
reasonable and appropriate considering the Company and its property, business
and operations. To the best of the Company's knowledge, all of the Company
Insurance Contracts are in full force and effect. The Company has committed no
default under any such Insurance Contract which could permit the insurer to deny
payment of claims thereunder. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company, and the

                                      -28-
<PAGE>

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not cause the Company
to be in violation or default under any Company Insurance Contracts, nor entitle
any other party thereto to terminate or modify a Company Insurance Contract. The
Company has not received or given a notice of cancellation with respect to any
of the Company Insurance Contracts.

            3.20 BANKING RELATIONSHIPS. Section 3.20 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule shows the names and locations of all banks and trust companies in which
the Company has accounts, lines of credit or safety deposit boxes and, with
respect to each account, line of credit or safety deposit box, the names of all
persons authorized to draw thereon or to have access thereto.

            3.21 SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND CUSTOMERS. Since the date of the
Company Balance Sheet, no material supplier, distributor or customer of the
Company has cancelled or otherwise modified its relationship with the Company in
a manner that is materially adverse to the Company and, to the knowledge of the
Company or the Principal, no supplier, distributor or customer of the Company
has any intention to do so.

            3.22 PRODUCT WARRANTY. Each product sold, leased, licensed or
delivered by the Company has been in conformity in all material respects with
all contractual commitments and all express and implied warranties applicable
thereto. Since January 1, 2000, the warranty expenses incurred by the Company
have not been material to the Company in the aggregate. The Company has no
notice of any claim of failure of its products to conform to any applicable
contractual commitments or warranties that could give rise to material liability
on the part of the Company. Schedule 3.22 hereto includes copies of the standard
terms and conditions of license and sale for the Company (containing applicable
warranty and indemnity provisions). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.22, no
product sold, leased, licensed or delivered by the Company is subject to any
guaranty, warranty, or other indemnity that differs in any material respect from
the applicable standard terms and conditions of license and sale and such other
indemnities and warranties disclosed on Schedule 3.22, other than differences
that, individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to give
rise to material liability on the part of the Company.

            3.23 POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST. No officer or director of the
Company: (i) owns, directly or indirectly, any interest in (excepting not more
than 5% stock holdings for investment purposes in securities of publicly held
and traded companies) or is an officer, director, employee or consultant of any
Person that is a direct competitor listed on Schedule 3.23, or a significant
lessor, lessee, customer or supplier of the Company; (ii) owns, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, any Company Proprietary Rights; (iii) has any
cause of action or other claim whatsoever against the Company, except for claims
in the ordinary course of business, such as for accrued vacation pay, accrued
benefits under Company Plans and similar matters and agreements existing on the
date hereof; (iv) has made, on behalf of the Company, any payment or commitment
to pay any commission, fee or other amount to, or purchase or obtain or
otherwise contract to purchase or obtain any goods or services from, any
corporation or other Person of which any officer or director of the Company, or,
to the knowledge of the Company or the Principal, a relative of any of the
foregoing, is a partner, shareholder or other securityholder (except stock
holdings solely for investment purposes in securities of publicly held and
traded companies); or (v) as of the date hereof or at any time since January 1,
2001, owes or owed any

                                      -29-
<PAGE>

money to the Company (except for normal expense reimbursements and similar
obligations for advances made by the Company to such person in the ordinary
course of business and not material in amount).

            3.24 ACCOUNTING SYSTEM. To the knowledge of the Company or the
Principal, the Company maintains a system of internal accounting controls
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a) transactions are executed in
accordance with management's general or specific authorizations; (b)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset accountability; (c)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's general or
specific authorization; and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is
compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action
is taken with respect to any differences.

            3.25 Certain Matters. The matters set forth on Schedule 3.25 are
true and correct.

            3.26 Full Disclosure. This Agreement, including the Company
Disclosure Schedule, does not contain any untrue statement by the Company of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to be stated to make
the statements by the Company contained herein not false or misleading.

stock of Merger Sub consists of 10,000 shares of Merger Sub Stock, of which 10

                  4.3.1 AUTHORITY. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the
corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the

and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and
validly authorized by the boards of directors of Parent and Merger Sub and the
shareholder of Merger Sub and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
Parent or Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby to be signed by
Parent or Merger Sub at or before the Effective Time have been duly executed and
delivered by Parent and Merger Sub, as the case may be, and constitute valid and
binding obligations of Parent and Merger Sub (assuming the Agreement has been
duly executed and delivered by the Company, the Shareholders and the Principal
and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, the
Shareholders and the Principal), as the case may be, enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with their respective terms, subject to the

                  4.3.2 NO CONFLICT. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub, nor the performance by Parent or Merger Sub
of its obligations hereunder, nor the consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (a) conflict with or result in a
violation of any provision of the charter documents or bylaws of Parent or
Merger Sub, or (b) with or without the giving of notice or the lapse of time, or
both, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of, or constitute a
default under, or result in any right to accelerate or result in the creation of

authorizations; (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation
of financial statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain asset
accountability; (c) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with

necessary to be stated to make the statements by the Parent contained herein not
false or misleading.

Person.

                                    ARTICLE 5

preparation or performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including all expenses, costs, fees and

advisors, brokers and finders, and accountants) shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses, whether or not the Merger shall be consummated.

            5.2 NON-DISCLOSURE. All information delivered to or obtained by or
on behalf of any party to this Agreement shall be held pursuant to the Letter
Agreement by and between the Parent and the Company dated January 3, 2002.

            5.3 REGISTRATION AGREEMENT. At the Closing, Parent, the
Shareholders, acting through the Shareholders' Representative, and the

(the "Registration Agreement") substantially in the form of Exhibit C.

            5.4 EMPLOYEES.

                  (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cooperate with Parent in granting access to employees of
the Company for employment interviews at such time and in such manner as Parent
and the Company shall reasonably

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

determine. At least five (5) business days before the expected Closing, Parent
shall deliver written notice to the Company identifying the employees of the
Company Parent proposes to retain as employees of the Surviving Corporation from

continued employment by the Surviving Corporation and who agree to continue
their employment with the Surviving Corporation after the Closing shall be
referred to as the "Retained Employees."

                  (b) Unless otherwise required by applicable law to provide
greater compensation and benefits, the Retained Employees shall for a period of
one year following the Effective Time be entitled to receive compensation and
benefits equivalent in the aggregate with those received by employees of Parent
having similar responsibilities, payable in a manner consistent with Parent's
normal business practices. The Retained Employees will be required to execute
Parent's standard paperwork, including, without limitation, Parent's current
form of intellectual property, non-competition and non-solicitation agreement;
provided, however, that Retained Employees based in the United Kingdom will not
be required to execute such paperwork as a condition of employment with Parent
if such a condition is prohibited by United Kingdom law.

                  (c) For purposes of any employee benefit plans, programs and
policies of Parent in which they become participants, the Retained Employees
shall be given credit for all service with the Company or its subsidiaries (and
service credited by Company or such subsidiary), substantially to the same
extent as if such service had been rendered as employees of Parent. To the
extent permitted by the terms of the applicable Parent plans and applicable
laws, Parent shall (i) waive limitations as to preexisting conditions,
exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage, and
(ii) provide credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under any benefit plans of Parent.

                  (d) Except as otherwise required by applicable law, the terms
of this Section shall not obligate the Parent to offer continued employment to
any employee of the Company before or after the Closing or entitle any employee
of the Company to remain in the employment of the Company or become employed by
the Parent, affect the right of the Company to terminate any employee at any
time, or affect the right of the Parent to establish, modify or terminate any
employee benefit plan or any benefit under any such plan at any time.

            5.5 TRANSACTION BONUS AGREEMENTS.

                  The Company has adopted a Transaction Bonus Plan (the
"Transaction Bonus Plan") which amends and restates the Company's Management
Retention Bonus Plan previously established by the Company to retain key
management personnel during the search and negotiation and after the
consummation of a change of control transaction, and each employee (each an
Executive and collectively the "Executives") who is a participant in the
Transaction Bonus Plan will enter into a Transaction Bonus Agreement in
substantially the form of Exhibit D (collectively, the "Transaction Bonus
Agreements"). Subject to Section 2.7 and the remainder of this paragraph, Parent
will provide for the payment by the Company to such Executives transaction
bonuses in the aggregate amount of $3,500,000 (the "Transaction Bonus Amount").
Two Million Two Hundred Forty Thousand Dollars ($2,240,000) of the Transaction
Bonus


                                      -34-
<PAGE>
Amount will be paid at the Closing to the Executives in the amounts set forth on
Schedule 5.5 and Five Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($560,000) of the
Transaction Bonus will be placed in escrow in accordance with Section 2.7(b).
Payment of the remaining Seven Hundred Thousand ($700,000) of the Transaction
Bonus Amount (the "Earn Out Amount"), will be contingent upon Revenues (as
defined below) reaching certain thresholds during the following periods (each an
"Earn Out Period"), as follows:

            (i) if $5,000,000 or more in Revenues is achieved between the date
of Closing and September 30, 2002, 100% of the Earn Out Amount will be paid, and
clauses (ii) through (iv) below will be inapplicable;

            (ii) if $3,000,000 or more but less than $5,000,000 in Revenues is
achieved between the date of Closing and September 30, 2002, 60% of the Earn Out
Amount will be paid;

            (iii) if the sum of Revenues achieved between October 1, 2002 and
December 31, 2002 plus Revenues achieved between the date of Closing and
September 30, 2002 in excess of $3,000,000 equals at least $1,000,000 but less
than $2,000,000, 20% of the Earn Out Amount will be paid; and

            (iv) if the sum of Revenues achieved between October 1, 2002 and
December 31, 2002 plus Revenues achieved between the date of Closing and
September 30, 2002 in excess of $3,000,000 equals or exceeds $2,000,000, an
additional 20% of the Earn Out Amount will be paid.

            Payments of the Earn Out Amount, if any, in respect of any Earn Out
Period shall be made within five business days following the date that Parent's
independent public accountants complete its quarterly review or audit, as the
case may be, and such audit or review shows that such Earn Out Amount is
achieved. In connection with payments of the Earn Out Amount, 80% of each such
payment shall be paid to the Executives in the proportions set forth on Schedule
5.5, and 20% of each such payment will be placed in escrow in accordance with
Section 2.7(b).

            For purposes of this Section, "Revenue" means revenue of the Company
determined in accordance with GAAP and recognized by the Parent attributable to
sales of new software licenses of the Company's products, plus the amount of the
first year's maintenance fees attributable to such new licenses. If Parent
shall, prior to December 31, 2002, (1) cease to offer for sale or announce that
it will no longer provide support for the products of the Company, (2) reduce
the number of full-time direct sales representatives employed by the Company or
the Parent who devote all or substantially all of their activities as an
employee to selling the Company's products to fewer than four (4) persons, (3)
cease to provide support at an executive level for the marketing and sale of the
Company's products, (4) cease to position the Company's products as part of the
Parent's strategic portfolio of products, (5) cease to provide or announce that
it will no longer provide support for any current platform for the products of
the Company, (6) fire without cause any of the Principal, John deWit, Werner
Knoblich, Rachel Cassidy or Hector Nevarez that are employed by Parent after the
Merger (other than as agreed with such person prior to or contemporaneously with
the Closing), (7) refuse to honor the terms of any existing proposals made on
commercially reasonable terms by the Company to potential

                                      -35-
<PAGE>
customers, (8) act unreasonably in the negotiation of the final terms with
potential customers with the purpose of frustrating the closing of new license
transactions or (9) otherwise act in bad faith in order to avoid paying the all
or part of the Earn Out Amount pursuant to this Section 5.5 (each an "Earn Out
Acceleration Event"), then, notwithstanding the failure of the Company to
achieve the minimum Revenues specified for any such period, within ten business
days of the occurrence of such Earn Out Acceleration Event, and only if and to
the extent that such Earn Out Acceleration Event(s) demonstrably contributed to
the failure to achieve the applicable Revenue threshold, Parent will pay 100% of
the Earn Out Amount; provided, that if the Earn Out Acceleration Event occurs
after September 30, 2002, only 40% of the Earn Out Amount will be paid pursuant
to this clause.

            5.6   RESIGNATIONS. Each member of the board of directors of the
Company shall resign as a director of the Company, effective as of the Effective
Time. Each officer of the Company shall resign as an officer, effective as of
the Effective Time.

            5.7   PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. No party to this Agreement shall issue
any press release or make any public announcement relating to the terms of this
Agreement prior to the Effective Time without the prior approval of the other
parties hereto (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that any party to this Agreement may make any public disclosure it
believes in good faith is required by applicable law or any listing agreement
concerning its publicly-traded securities (in which case the disclosing party
will use its reasonable best efforts to advise the other parties prior to making
the disclosure).

            5.8   FURTHER ASSURANCES. Subject to terms and conditions herein
provided, each of the parties, severally and not jointly, agree to use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, Parent and the Company each, severally and not jointly, will use
all reasonable efforts to obtain all approvals, authorizations, consents and
waivers from, and give all notices to, any public or private third parties that
are necessary on its, his or her part in order to effect the transactions
contemplated hereby.

            5.9   Directors' and Officers' Insurance; Indemnification.

                  (a) Parent agrees to maintain in effect in accordance with
their terms all rights to indemnification in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time that now exist in favor of current or
former officers or directors of the Company as provided in the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

                  (b) For a period of three years after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect, if available, directors' and
officers' liability insurance (the "Tail Policy") covering those persons who are
currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy (a copy of which has been made available to Parent) on terms comparable
to those now applicable to directors and officers of the Company with respect to
any occurrence prior to the closing; provided, however, that in no event shall
the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of $100,000 for such
coverage, and that if the

                                      -36-
<PAGE>
premium for such coverage exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
purchase a policy with the largest policy limit available for $100,000.

            5.10  COMERICA BANK LINE. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
pay in full all outstanding amounts owed under its Loan and Security Agreement
between Comerica Bank - California, successor in interest to Imperial Bank, and
the Company as amended to April 20, 2001 (the "Comerica Bank Line"). The Company
and the Parent shall cooperate in good faith and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to have the letter of credit issued by Comerica Bank on
behalf of the Company to secure the obligations of the Company under the
Washington Real Estate Investment Trust Office Building Lease by and between
WRIT Limited Partnership and the Company terminated and released as security for
such obligations. Parent will assume the obligations of the Company under that
certain Warrant to Purchase Stock dated April 20, 2001 issued to Comerica Bank -
California, successor in interest to Imperial Bank, by the Company, to the
extent that it is still outstanding at the Effective Time.

Closing.

            5.12  TAXABLE TRANSACTION. It is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a taxable transaction and shall not constitute a
tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. Each
party hereto agrees not to take any position contrary to such intention with any
Government Entity, including, without limitation, on any Tax returns or other
filings. In connection therewith, for a period of two years, Parent agrees to
take (or refrain from taking) such actions as may be requested by the
Shareholders' Representative and that as confirmed by the Parent's tax advisors
are reasonably necessary to cause the Merger not to constitute a taxable
transaction. In particular, Parent hereby agrees to maintain the Company as a
third tier (or lower) subsidiary in Parent's corporate organizational structure
for such two-year period. For purposes of this Agreement, a "third tier"
subsidiary means a subsidiary that is held by a corporation through two
intermediate holding corporations above such subsidiary and below the parent
corporation.

            5.13 SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. The Company agrees to use reasonable
efforts to obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the shares of
Company Common Stock (after giving effect to the Recapitalization), excluding
shares held by any holder of Common Stock who prior to the Recapitalization was
a holder of a Subordinated Note.

                  INDEMNIFICATION; SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS

            8.1   AGREEMENT TO INDEMNIFY.

                  8.1.1 PARENT CLAIMS. Subject to the terms and conditions of

(collectively, all such amounts are hereinafter referred to as "Parent Claims")
which arise out of or are attributable to any of the following:

                        (a) failure of any of the representations, warranties,
                  covenants and agreements of the Company and the Principal
                  contained in this Agreement including the Company Disclosure
                  Schedule or in any other agreement, certificate or other
                  document among or between the parties contemplated by or
                  referred to herein (with respect to representations and
                  warranties) to be true, complete and correct in all material
                  respects or (with respect to covenants and agreements) fully
                  performed and fulfilled in all material respects;

                        (b) the Company's failure to pay Taxes in any
                  jurisdiction prior to the date hereof (regardless of any
                  disclosure thereof herein) ("Tax Claims");

                        (c) the assertion by any stockholder of the Company of
                  any claim, or institution by any such stockholder of any
                  action or proceeding, which arises out of the issuance and
                  sale of the Subordinated Notes, the Recapitalization or the
                  merger or the transactions contemplated hereby (excluding any
                  proceeding for appraisal of such stockholder's shares pursuant
                  to Section 262 of the Act); or

                                      -40-
<PAGE>
                        (d) any fraud or any fraudulent misrepresentation
                  committed by the Company, a Shareholder or the Principal in
                  connection with the transactions contemplated by this
                  Agreement ("Fraud Claims").

                  8.1.2 BENEFIT OF PARENT GROUP. With respect to any member of
the Parent Group other than Parent, the Shareholders, the Shareholders'
Representative and the Principal acknowledge and agree that Parent is
contracting on its own behalf and for such member and Parent shall obtain and
hold the rights and benefits provided for in this Section 8.1 in trust for and
on behalf of such member.

            8.2   SURVIVAL. All representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by any party in this Agreement or any certificate or other
writing delivered pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the
Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf of any other
party for a period of one year from the Closing Date, provided, however, that
the representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.10, 3.17 and 3.25
shall survive the Closing and any investigation at any time made by or on behalf
of any other party for a period of two years from the Closing;

            8.3   LIMITATION OF SHAREHOLDERS' AND PRINCIPAL'S LIABILITY FOR
CERTAIN PARENT CLAIMS.  The obligations and liabilities of the Shareholders and
the Principal hereunder with respect to indemnification for Parent Claims shall
be subject to the following limitations:

                        (a) All Parent Claims against any Shareholder or the
                  Principal shall be made exclusively against the Escrow Fund
                  except with respect to Fraud Claims. None of the Shareholders
                  or the Principal shall have any liability under or arising out
                  of the terms of this Agreement except as set forth in the
                  immediately preceding sentence. No Parent claims may be
                  brought against the Section 3.25 Escrow Account except for
                  Parent Claims pursuant to Article 8 solely relating to or
                  arising out of any inaccuracy in the representations in
                  Section 3.25 or Schedule 3.25.

                        (b) No indemnification shall be required to be made by
                  the Shareholders or the Principal hereunder and no Parent
                  Claims may be brought against the Escrow Fund unless the
                  amount of Parent Claims exceeds $100,000 in the aggregate, in
                  which case the Shareholders' and the Principal's
                  indemnification obligations shall apply to all Parent Claims
                  without regard to such threshold.

                        (c) For purposes of determining the amount of property
                  recoverable from the Escrow Fund sufficient to satisfy a
                  Parent Claim subject to indemnification hereunder, the value
                  of a share of Parent Stock shall be equal to the
                  Indemnification Value. For purposes hereof, "Indemnification
                  Value" means (i) with respect to any recovery hereunder
                  determined by arbitration proceeding, the average of the
                  prices at which the Parent Stock last traded on each of the
                  twenty trading days immediately preceding the date of the
                  award from such proceeding, as such prices are reported on the
                  Nasdaq National Market, (ii) in the case of a recovery
                  hereunder determined by written agreement between Parent and
                  the Shareholders' Representative, the average of the prices at
                  which the Parent Stock last traded on each of the twenty
                  trading days immediately preceding the date of such agreement,
                  as such prices are reported on the Nasdaq National

                                      -41-
<PAGE>
                  Market, and (iii) in the case of a recovery hereunder where
                  the Shareholders' Representative is deemed not to dispute the
                  Parent Claim or the amount of the recovery because the
                  Shareholders' Representative has not responded as provided in
                  Section 8.4.2, the average of the prices at which the Parent
                  Stock last traded on each of the twenty trading days
                  immediately preceding the date that is 45 days after the
                  Shareholders' Representative and the Escrow Agent were given
                  notice of such Parent Claim pursuant to Section 8.4.1 and the
                  Escrow Agreement, as such prices are reported on the Nasdaq
                  National Market.

                        (d) With respect to Parent Claims arising out of or
                  relating to Fraud Claims, only those Shareholders or
                  Principals who are responsible for such Fraud Claims shall be
                  liable for indemnification hereunder in excess of the Escrow
                  Fund.

                        (e) No Parent Claims may be brought against the Escrow
                  Fund for any Tax imposed on or incurred by the Company as a
                  result of an election made under Section 338(g) of the Code by
                  Parent or its Affiliates with respect to the Merger. None of
                  the Shareholders or the Principal shall have any liability
                  arising out of or as a result of any Tax imposed on or
                  incurred by the Company as a result of an election made under
                  Section 338(g) of the Code by Parent or its Affiliates with
                  respect to the Merger.

            8.4   PROCESS OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR PARENT CLAIMS.

                  8.4.1 RECOVERY BY PARENT. In seeking to collect the amount of
any Parent Claim that a member of the Parent Group has established and is
entitled to indemnification for hereunder, Parent shall first give the
Shareholders' Representative and the Escrow Agent written notice of such Parent
Claim. Such notice shall contain a brief summary of the basis for the Parent
Claim. If the Shareholders' Representative does not dispute the basis or amount
of any Parent Claim within 45 days of receiving written notice thereof, Parent
shall have the right promptly to recover indemnity as and to the extent provided
herein. If the Shareholders' Representative disagrees with the basis of the
Parent Claim or the amount of damages caused thereby, then within 45 days of
receiving written notice thereof, the Shareholders' Representative shall give
notice to Parent of such disagreement and, in that case, Parent shall have no
right to recover indemnity hereunder until such time, if at all, as (a) an
arbitrator has issued a decision from an arbitration proceeding completed
pursuant to the Escrow Agreement (subject to the limitations contained in
Article 8) or (b) Parent and the Shareholders' Representative agree in writing
to the amount of Parent's recovery, in which case Parent shall have the right
promptly to recover the amount so agreed.

                  8.4.2 THIRD-PARTY PARENT CLAIMS. Parent agrees to notify the
Shareholders' Representative promptly of any Parent Claims asserted by third
parties that, in the opinion of Parent, are reasonably likely to give rise to
indemnification hereunder ("Third-Party Parent Claims"). Parent shall permit the
indemnifying party or parties to assume the defense of any such Third-Party
Parent Claim, provided that counsel for the indemnifying parties, who shall
conduct the defense of such Third-Party Parent Claim, shall be subject to the
approval of Parent (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). Parent
may participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, however, that the
indemnifying parties shall pay such expense if Parent shall have reasonably
concluded that there is a substantial probability of a conflict

                                      -42-
<PAGE>
between the positions of the indemnifying parties and Parent in conducting the
defense of any such Third-Party Parent Claim or that there may be legal defenses
available to it that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying parties. Parent agrees that it will not settle any Third-Party
Parent Claims without the consent of the Shareholders' Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent further agrees
that if the Shareholders' Representative wishes to enter into a settlement with
respect to a Third-Party Parent Claim on terms reasonably acceptable to Parent,
Parent will cooperate in such settlement, provided that such settlement
includes, as an unconditional term thereof, the giving by the third party to
Parent of a release from all liability in respect of such Third-Party Parent
Claim.

Shareholders' Representative.

            9.2   WAIVER. The terms and conditions of this Agreement may be
waived only by a written instrument signed by the party waiving compliance. The
failure of any party hereto to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision, nor
in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the
right of such party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision. No
waiver of any breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to
be a waiver of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance. The rights and
remedies herein provided are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.

            9.3   GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed and enforced in accordance with, the substantive laws of The
Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to its principles of conflicts of
laws. The parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or
federal court located in The Commonwealth of Massachusetts with respect to any
dispute that arises under this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

referenced in Section 5.2 and the documents and instruments and other agreements

entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and

Party") brings a claim in litigation against another party hereto (a "Defending
Party") relating to or arising out of this Agreement, and a court of competent
jurisdiction issues a final, non-appealable order specifying that the Charging
Party has not prevailed on any part of such claim, then the Charging Party shall
pay to the Defending Party the reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and disbursements) of the Defending Party in
defending such claim.
