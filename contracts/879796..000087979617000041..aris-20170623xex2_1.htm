 \t\t\t(d) Company Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.1(d) sets forth, as of the
date of this Agreement, each Subsidiary of the Company and its jurisdiction of
organization or formation. Except as described in Schedule 3.1(d), all issued
and outstanding shares of capital stock, limited liability company interests

case of any Subsidiary which is a corporation) nonassessable, and (ii) are
owned beneficially and of record directly or indirectly by the Company, free
and clear of all Encumbrances, except for any Permitted Encumbrances and any
other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other equity or voting interest)
that would prevent such Subsidiary from conducting its business as of the
Effective Time in substantially the same manner that such business is
conducted on the date of this Agreement. Each such Subsidiary of the Company
is duly organized or formed, validly existing and, to the extent such concept
is recognized, in good standing or active status under the Laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization or formation. Each Subsidiary of the Company
is qualified or otherwise authorized to act as a foreign entity and, to the
extent such concept is recognized, is in good standing under the Laws of every
other jurisdiction in which such qualification or authorization is necessary
under applicable Law, except where the failure to be so qualified or otherwise
authorized or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Each Subsidiary of the Company has all requisite
corporate, limited liability company or other  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t23  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tentity (as applicable) power and authority to carry on its business as
now conducted. There are no (i) authorized or outstanding Equity or other
securities of any of the Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for, no

giving any Person any right to subscribe for or acquire from, or providing for
the issuance or sale of, any capital stock or other ownership interest in, or
any other securities of, any Subsidiary, (ii) voting trusts, proxies or other
agreements among the Subsidiaries' stockholders with respect to the voting,

capital stock or other ownership interest, or (iii) outstanding obligations of
any of the Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any
outstanding shares of capital stock or other ownership interests in any
Subsidiary or to provide funds to, or make any investment in any other Person.
There are no outstanding or authorized stock or equity appreciation rights,
phantom stock rights, or other phantom equity related instruments, profit
participation or similar rights with respect to any Subsidiary. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Company Reports; Historical Financial Statements; No
Undisclosed Liabilities; Internal Controls; NASDAQ Compliance. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) The Company has filed with the SEC all forms, documents and
reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date hereof by it since
July 31, 2014 (the "Company Reports"). As of their respective dates, or, if
amended, as of the date of the last such amendment, the Company Reports
complied, or if not yet filed or furnished, will comply, in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act of 1933 (the "Securities Act"), as the case may be, and the
applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and none of the
Company Reports at the time they were filed contained, or if not yet filed,
will not contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, or are to be made, not misleading  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited
consolidated quarterly financial statements of the Company included or
incorporated by reference in the Company Reports (collectively, the
"Historical Financial Statements") fairly present in all material respects, or
if filed after the date hereof, will fairly present, in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis (except as expressly disclosed in the notes
thereto), the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and their consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal year-end audit adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim
financial statements, which are not material, individually or in the
aggregate). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations that would be required to be reflected in, or
reserved against, or otherwise described on, a balance sheet prepared in
accordance with GAAP (whether accrued or fixed, absolute or contingent,
matured or unmatured, whether  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t24  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tdue or to become due and regardless of when or by whom asserted),
other than (A) liabilities or obligations reflected in, or reserved against,
or otherwise described in, the Historical Financial Statements, (B)
liabilities or obligations which were incurred in the Ordinary Course of
Business after the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, (C) liabilities or
obligations incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents, or (D) liabilities or obligations that would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) The Company maintains internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under the
Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is effective in
providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects. The Company (i) maintains
disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the
Exchange Act that are effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents and (ii) has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Company's
outside auditors and the Board (1) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Company's ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information and (2) any fraud, known
to the Company, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal control over
financial reporting. Since July 31, 2015 and through the date of this
Agreement, to the Knowledge of the Company, no events, facts or circumstances
have occurred such that management would not be able to complete its
assessment of the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over
financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the fiscal year ending July 31, 2017, and conclude,
after such assessment, that such system was effective. Since July 31, 2015,
the principal executive officer and principal financial officer of the Company
have made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the
Company nor its principal executive officer or principal financial officer has
received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the
accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications. The
Company is in compliance with the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules of NASDAQ, except for any non-compliance that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. As
of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC with respect to the Company Reports.
 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) No Conflict or Violation. The execution and delivery by the
Company of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which
it is (or will be) a party, and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will not (i) assuming that all
filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations,  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t25  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tconsents and approvals described in Section 3.1(b) have been made or
obtained (or the expiration of any applicable waiting period), violate any
applicable Law to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is subject,
(ii) assuming all necessary consents required under the agreements set forth
on Schedule 3.1(f) have been obtained prior to the Closing, conflict with,
result in a violation or breach of, constitute a default or any event that,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default, under, result in
the acceleration of any obligations under, or require any notice under, any
Company Contract, or (iii) conflict with or violate the articles or
certificate of incorporation or formation, by-laws, limited liability company
agreement or such other organizational documents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Legal Proceedings. As of the date of this Agreement, there
are no material Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any of their
respective officers or members of the board of managers or board of directors
(or comparable governing body) in connection with the Business), before any
Governmental Entity. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries challenging the validity of or which would reasonably
be expected to prevent, delay, affect or prohibit, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is subject to any material
judgments, settlements, writs, decrees, injunctions or orders of any
Governmental Entity. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Personal Property. Except as may be reflected in, reserved
against, or otherwise described on the Historical Financial Statements
(including any notes thereto), the Company and its Subsidiaries have good,
marketable and valid title to (or, in the case of leased tangible personal
property, a valid and subsisting leasehold interest in), free and clear of any
Encumbrances (except for Permitted Encumbrances), all of the tangible personal
property reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet and all tangible personal
property acquired by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries since the date of
the Interim Balance Sheet, except for (i) sales or other dispositions of
personal property that are replaced by similar assets or properties, (ii)
personal property sold, consumed, used or otherwise disposed in the Ordinary
Course of Business since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, (iii)
dispositions of used, worn out, obsolete or surplus assets or properties since
the date of the Interim Balance Sheet or (iv) personal property, the failure
of which to have good and valid title to (or a valid and subsisting leasehold
interest in) would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The material facilities,
machinery, equipment and other tangible assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries have been maintained in accordance with normal industry practice.
The Company and its Subsidiaries own or lease under valid leases all material
facilities, machinery, equipment and other tangible assets necessary for the
conduct of the Business as currently conducted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Real Property. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t26  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries owns any
fee title interest in real property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Schedule 3.1(i)(ii) identifies each material written lease
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party pursuant to which
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries leases interests in real property (the
"Leased Real Property"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) The Company or its applicable Subsidiary has valid
leasehold title to each written lease to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to the Leased Real Property (each, a
"Company Lease," and collectively, the "Company Leases"), in each case, free
and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances). The Company
has made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Company
Leases (including all material amendments, modifications and supplements
thereto). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) None of the Company Leases has been amended or extended
subsequent to the date of the Interim Balance Sheet, and neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has sent written notice to any landlord of any
Leased Real Property claiming that such landlord is in default under any of
the Company Leases, which default remains uncured. To the Knowledge of the
Company, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in material breach
of or default pursuant to any Company Lease. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) Subleases. Section 3.1(i)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Schedules contains a true, correct and complete list of all of the existing
material subleases, licenses or similar agreements (each, a "Sublease")
granting to any Person, other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any
right to use or occupy, now or in the future, any Leased Real Property. With
respect to each of the Subleases, (i) to the Knowledge of the Company, there
are no disputes with respect to such Sublease; and (ii) the other party to
such Sublease is not an Affiliate of, and otherwise does not have any economic
interest in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Taxes. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.1(j)(i), the Company and
its Subsidiaries have accurately (in all material respects) and timely filed
(taking into account extensions) all income and all other material Tax Returns
required to have been filed by them and have timely paid all material Taxes
due (whether or not shown to be due thereon). The most recent financial
statements contained in the Company SEC Documents reflect an adequate reserve
(in accordance with GAAP) for all Taxes accrued but not then payable by the
Company and its Subsidiaries through the date of such financial statements.
The Company and its Subsidiaries have timely paid or withheld with respect to
their employees and other third Persons (and paid over any amounts withheld to
the appropriate Tax authority) all material Taxes required to be paid or
withheld. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t27  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) As of the date hereof, there are no pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened Actions for the assessment or collection
of material Taxes owed or owing by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. No
audits or other examinations with respect to Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries are presently in progress or have been asserted or proposed to
the Company or its Subsidiaries in writing. No written claim has ever been
made to the Company or its subsidiaries by a Governmental Entity in a
jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns that the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, is or may be
subject to tax in that jurisdiction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
executed or filed with any Taxing Authority any agreement extending the period
for assessment or collection of any Taxes which has not since expired. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries (i) is a
party to or bound by, or currently has any material liability pursuant to, any
Tax sharing, allocation or indemnification agreement or obligation, other than
any such agreement or obligation entered into in the Ordinary Course of
Business; or (ii) has any material liability for the Taxes of any Person other
than the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury Regulation §
1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or non-United States law)
as a transferee or successor, or otherwise by operation of law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have
entered into, or participated in, any "listed transaction" within the meaning
of Section 6707A(c)(2) of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
constituted either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation"
in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment pursuant
to Section 355 of the Code. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vii) The representations and warranties set forth in this
Section 3.1(j) shall constitute the Company's sole representations and
warranties with respect to Taxes and Tax Returns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Absence of Certain Changes. Since July 31, 2016, until the
date of this Agreement, there has not occurred any Material Adverse Effect.
Except as contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents,
since the date of the Interim Balance Sheet until the date of this Agreement,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have operated the Business in the Ordinary
Course of Business in all material respects (subject to the effects resulting
from the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the other Transaction Documents and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby), and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has: \t\t

 \t\t\t(u) Takeover Laws. Assuming compliance by Parent and MergerSub
with their respective obligations hereunder and the accuracy of the

from a financial point of view, to such holders. A copy of such opinion has
been or will promptly be provided to the Parent. \t\t

 \t\t\t(AS QUALIFIED BY THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES AND THE COMPANY SEC
DOCUMENTS), THE COMPANY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL LIABILITY AND RESPONSIBILITY
FOR ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, PROJECTION, FORECAST, STATEMENT OR
INFORMATION MADE, COMMUNICATED OR FURNISHED (ORALLY, IN WRITING,
ELECTRONICALLY OR OTHERWISE) TO PARENT, MERGERSUB OR ANY OTHER PERSON
(INCLUDING ANY OPINION, INFORMATION, PROJECTION OR ADVICE THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
OR MAY BE PROVIDED TO PARENT, MERGERSUB OR ANY OTHER PERSON). THE COMPANY

PERSON REGARDING THE PROBABLE SUCCESS OR PROFITABILITY OF THE BUSINESS.
NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING IN THIS
SECTION 3.1), NOTHING HEREIN SHALL LIMIT IN ANY WAY CLAIMS OR REMEDIES FOR
FRAUD OR INTENTIONAL MISREPRESENTATION. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 3.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent and
MergerSub. Each of Parent and MergerSub represents and warrants to the
Company that the statements made in this Section 3.2 as follows. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Due Organization and Good Standing. Each of Parent and
MergerSub is duly organized, validly existing and, to the extent such concept
is recognized, in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization and has all requisite corporate or limited
liability power, as applicable, and authority necessary to carry on its
business as now conducted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Capitalization of MergerSub. As of the date hereof, the
authorized share capital of MergerSub consists of 1,000 shares, $0.01 par
value per share, 100 of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the
issued and outstanding share capital of MergerSub is, and at the Effective
Time will be, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent. MergerSub was formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the
transactions contemplated hereby, and it has not conducted any business prior
to the date hereof and has no, and prior to the Effective Time will have no,
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature other than those incident to
its formation and pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, liabilities related to the Debt Financing). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Authorization of Transaction. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Each of Parent and MergerSub has full corporate or limited
liability power, as applicable, and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and each of the other Transaction Documents to which it is (or will
be) a party, to perform its covenants and obligations hereunder and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution
and delivery by Parent and MergerSub of this Agreement and each of the other
Transaction Documents to which it is (or will be) a party and the consummation
by Parent and MergerSub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
have been duly and validly  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t41  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tauthorized by all required corporate or limited liability company
action on the part of Parent and MergerSub and no other corporate or limited
liability company proceedings on the part of Parent or MergerSub are necessary
to authorize the execution and delivery by Parent and MergerSub of this
Agreement and each such other Transaction Document or the consummation by
Parent and MergerSub of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. This
Agreement has been (or, in the case of each Transaction Document to be entered
into by Parent and MergerSub at or prior to the Closing, will be) duly
executed and delivered by Parent and MergerSub, and, assuming the due
execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes (or, in the
case of each Transaction Document to be entered into by Parent and MergerSub
at or prior to the Closing, will constitute) a valid and legally binding
obligation of Parent and MergerSub, enforceable against Parent and MergerSub
in accordance with its terms, except that such enforcement may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws now
or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors and general principles of equity (whether considered in a proceeding
at law or in equity) and the discretion of the court before which any
proceeding therefor may be brought. No filing or registration with,
notification to, or authorization, consent or approval of any Governmental
Entity is required in connection with the execution and delivery by Parent or
MergerSub of the Transaction Documents to which each is (or will be) a party,
or the consummation by Parent or MergerSub of their respective obligations
thereunder, except (i) filings under the HSR Act or any other applicable
competition Laws, (ii) the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Wisconsin
Department of Financial Institutions, and (iii) such other Governmental Entity
filings, registrations, notifications, authorizations, consents or approvals
the failure of which to be obtained or made would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay
Parent's or MergerSub's performance of its obligations under this Agreement or
any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is (or will be) a party, or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent
has caused the Guarantor to deliver to the Company the duly executed limited
guaranty (the "Limited Guaranty") of True Wind Capital, L.P. (the
"Guarantor"), in favor of the Company. The Guarantor has all necessary
organizational power and authority to execute and deliver the Limited
Guaranty, to perform its obligations thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery by the
Guarantor of the Limited Guaranty, the performance by the Guarantor of its
obligations thereunder and the consummation by the Guarantor of the
transactions contemplated thereby, have been duly and validly authorized by
all necessary organizational action on the part of the Guarantor. The Limited
Guaranty has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Guarantor, is
in full force and effect and constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation
of the Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its
terms, subject in each case to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or other
similar Laws of general application affecting the rights and remedies of
creditors, and to general principles of equity. No event has occurred which,
with or without notice, lapse of time or  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t42  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tboth, could constitute a default on the part of the Guarantor under
the Limited Guaranty. The Guarantor has the financial capacity to pay and
perform its obligations under the Limited Guaranty, and all funds necessary
for the Guarantor to fulfill its obligation under the Limited Guaranty will be
available to the Guarantor for so long as the Limited Guaranty remains in
effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Brokers' Fees. Neither Parent nor MergerSub has employed or
retained any broker or finder or incurred, or will otherwise become liable
for, any liability for any investment banking fees, brokerage fees,
commissions or finders' fees in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents for which any of
the Shareholders, the Awardholders, the Company or any of the Company's
Subsidiaries will be responsible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Legal Proceedings. There are no Actions pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or MergerSub, which, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially
impair or delay Parent's or MergerSub's performance of its obligations under
this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is (or
will be) a party, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby. Neither Parent nor MergerSub nor any of their Subsidiaries is
subject to any judgment, settlement, writ, decree, injunction or order of any
court, which would reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or
delay Parent's or MergerSub's performance of its obligations under this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents to which it is (or will
be) a party, or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) No Conflict or Violation. The execution and delivery by
each of Parent and MergerSub of this Agreement or any of the other Transaction
Documents to which it is (or will be) a party, and the consummation by each of
Parent and MergerSub of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, will
not (i) assuming that all filings, registrations, notifications,
authorizations, consents and approvals described in Section 3.2(c)(i) have
been made or obtained (or that all applicable waiting periods have expired),
violate any applicable Law to which Parent or MergerSub is subject, (ii)
conflict with, result in a violation or breach of, constitute a default, or
any event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would become a default,
under, result in the acceleration of any obligations under, or require any
notice under, any Contract, or (iii) conflict with, or violate the articles or
certificate of incorporation or formation, by-laws, limited liability company
agreement, partnership agreement or such other organizational documents of
Parent or MergerSub, except with respect to the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii)
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay Parent's or MergerSub's performance of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
to which it is (or will be) a party, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Inspections. Parent (directly or through its Affiliates,
advisors, agents and other representatives) has undertaken such investigation
as it has deemed necessary with respect to the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and each other  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t43  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tTransaction Document to which it is (or will be) a party, and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) Financing. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has
delivered to the Company true, complete and correct copies of (i) a fully
executed commitment letter, dated as of June 20, 2017 (including all exhibits,
schedules, annexes and amendments thereto), from the Guarantor (the "Equity
Commitment Letter") pursuant to which the Guarantor has committed to provide,
upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, equity funding to Parent
to enable Parent to provide the equity financing for the transactions
contemplated hereunder in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the "Equity
Financing "), and (ii) a fully executed commitment letter, dated as of June
20, 2017 (including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments thereto),
from the financial institutions parties thereto (the "Debt Commitment Letter,"
and together with the Equity Commitment Letter, the "Financing Commitment
Letters ") pursuant to which the lenders party thereto have committed, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, to provide debt financing to
MergerSub in the amounts set forth therein for the purpose of financing the
transactions contemplated hereunder and for other general corporate purposes
(collectively, the "Debt Financing," and together with the Equity Financing,
the "Financing"). The Equity Commitment Letter provides, and will continue to
provide, that the Company is a third party beneficiary thereof as set forth
therein. On or prior to the date hereof, Parent has also delivered to the
Company a true, complete and correct copy of the fully executed fee letter
(which fee letter may be redacted as customary for financings of this type)
that relates to the Debt Financing (the "Fee Letter"). Each of the Financing
Commitment Letters is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and each
of the other parties thereto, enforceable against Parent and, to the Knowledge
of Parent, each such other party in accordance with its terms, except as
enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting creditors' rights
generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and is in full force and
effect. Assuming the accuracy of the Company's representations and warranties
set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, as of the date of this Agreement,
neither Parent nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other counterparty thereto
has committed any breach of any of its covenants or other obligations set
forth in, or is in default under, any of the Financing Commitment Letters, and
to the Knowledge of Parent no event has occurred or circumstance exists that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to (i) constitute or result in a breach or default on the part of any
Person under any of the Financing Commitment Letters, (ii) constitute or
result in a failure to satisfy any of the terms or conditions set forth in any
of the Financing Commitment Letters, (iii) make any of the assumptions or any
of the statements set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters inaccurate in
any material respect or (iv) otherwise result in any portion of the Financing
not being available. Assuming the accuracy of the Company's representations
and warranties set forth in Section 3.1 of this Agreement, as of the date of
this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it will be unable to
satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition to be satisfied by it
contained in the Financing Commitment Letters. None of the Financing
Commitment Letters have been withdrawn, repudiated, rescinded or terminated,
or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect (and no such
withdrawal, repudiation, rescission, termination, amendment, supplement or
modification  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t44  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tis contemplated), and Parent has no reason to believe that the
Financing contemplated by any of the Financing Commitment Letters will not be
available as of the Closing. There are no conditions precedent or other
contingencies related to the funding of the full amounts of the Financing,
other than as set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters. Except for the
Fee Letter (which contains no additional conditions to those contained in the
Debt Commitment Letter), there are no agreements, side letters, Contracts,
understandings or arrangements to which Parent or any of its Affiliates is a
party relating to the Financing Commitment Letters or the Financing. Parent
has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees and amounts required
by any of the Financing Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of
this Agreement. The aggregate proceeds of the Financing constitute all of the
financing required for the payment by Parent of the Merger Consideration, the
Specified Debt Amount, the Fees and Expenses Amount, and all fees and expenses
incurred by Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents or for which Parent is liable
pursuant hereto or thereto. Assuming (x) satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in Section 4.1 and (y) the Debt Financing and Equity Financing are
funded in accordance with their terms, the Debt Financing and the Equity
Financing will be sufficient at the Closing to enable Parent to consummate on
a timely basis the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
Parent nor MergerSub is aware of any direct or indirect limitation or other
restriction on the ability of the lender parties in the Debt Financing to
provide financing for other potential purchasers of the Company.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) Solvency. As of the Closing, and after giving effect to all
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries will be Solvent.
Each of Parent and MergerSub do not intend, in consummating the transactions
contemplated herein, to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j) Proxy Statement. None of the information with respect to
Parent or MergerSub that Parent furnishes in writing to the Company expressly
for use in the Proxy Statement will, at the date the Proxy Statement is first
mailed to the Shareholders or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof or at the time of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k) Ownership of Common Stock. None of Parent, MergerSub or
True Wind Capital, L.P. or any of its affiliated investment funds beneficially
owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act)
any shares of Common Stock or any options, warrants or other rights to acquire
Common Stock or other securities of, or any other economic interest (through
derivative securities or otherwise) in, the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l) Interests in Competitors. Neither Parent nor MergerSub owns
any interest, nor do any of their respective Affiliates own any interest
insofar as such Affiliate-owned interest would be attributed to Parent or
MergerSub under the HSR Act, in any Person that derives a substantial portion
of its revenues from the same or a substantially similar line of business as
the Business. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t45  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m) Litigation. There is no suit, action or other proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or MergerSub
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay Parent's or MergerSub's performance of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
to which it is (or will be) a party, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, nor is there any decree, injunction, judgment,
order, ruling, assessment or writ of any Governmental Entity outstanding
against or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or MergerSub
that, individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to
prevent or materially impair or delay Parent's or MergerSub's performance of
its obligations under this Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents
to which it is (or will be) a party, or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(o) Absence of Certain Agreements. Neither Parent nor any of
its Affiliates has entered into any contract, agreement, arrangement or
understanding, or authorized, committed or agreed to enter into any binding
contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding, pursuant to which any
Shareholder would be entitled to receive consideration of a different amount
or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which any Shareholder
(a) agrees to vote to approve this Agreement or the Merger (b) agrees to vote
against any Superior Offer or (c) as of the date hereof, has agreed to provide
equity capital, directly or indirectly, to Parent or MergerSub to finance in
whole or in part the Merger. There are no Contracts or commitments to enter
into any such Contracts to which the Parent, the MergerSub or any of their
Affiliates is party pursuant to which any current employee of the Company has
agreed to (i) remain as an employee of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time at compensation levels in excess of
levels currently in effect (other than pursuant to any Company Benefit Plans
or Contracts with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the
date hereof), (ii) contribute any portion of such employee's shares of Common
Stock, Options or RSUs to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the Parent
or any of its Affiliates or (iii) receive any capital stock or equity
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the Parent or any of
its Affiliates. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(p) RELIANCE/ACKNOWLEDGMENT. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING CONTAINED
IN THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY,
PARENT AND MERGERSUB ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES EXPRESSLY MADE BY THE COMPANY IN SECTION 3.1 OF
THIS AGREEMENT (AS QUALIFIED BY THE COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES AND THE

public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger, and neither Parent nor MergerSub nor the
Company nor any of their respective Affiliates shall issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except
as such party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law or

shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Nothing in this
Section 5.2 shall limit the ability of any party hereto to make internal
announcements to their respective employees that are consistent in all
material respects with the prior public disclosures regarding the transactions
contemplated by  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t52  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tthis Agreement. Nothing in this Section 5.2, Section 5.3 or
elsewhere in this Agreement shall restrict or prohibit any disclosure made in
connection with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this
Agreement or any of the other Transaction Documents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.3 Confidentiality of Parent and MergerSub. Parent and
MergerSub shall, and Parent and MergerSub shall cause their Subsidiaries and
Representatives (as such term is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) to,
treat all nonpublic information obtained in connection with this Agreement
(including in connection with the access provisions of Section 5.4 hereof) and
the transactions contemplated hereby as confidential in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement by and between the Company and Parent
dated March 20, 2017 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"). The terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement are hereby incorporated herein by reference and
shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time the
Confidentiality Agreement shall terminate. If this Agreement is, for any
reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
continue in full force and effect, subject to Section 6.1(c) hereof. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.4 Access to Information. Subject to Section 5.3 hereof,
from the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, at Parent's expense, afford the advisors, representatives,
officers, directors, employees, auditors and other agents of Parent (provided,
that Parent shall cause such advisors, representatives, officers, directors,
employees, auditors and other agents to treat any information gained thereby
as confidential) reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable advance written notice, and subject to reasonable rules and
regulations of the Company, to (a) the Specified Company Employees and, with
the prior written consent of a Specified Company Employee (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), any of the other employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to which any Specified Company Employee
provides his consent, (b) the properties, offices and other facilities of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and (c) to the extent not prohibited by Law, all
books and records, and all financial, operating and other data and
information, with respect to the Business that are in the possession of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case, as Parent may reasonably
request; provided, however, (i) if the Company so requires, Parent's
representatives conducting any physical inspection of the properties, offices
or other facilities of the Company or one of its Subsidiaries shall be
accompanied by one or more representatives of the Company and (ii) the Company
shall not be required to provide any such access to the extent that it would
require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to (w) disclose information
subject to attorney-client privilege as advised by the Company's outside
counsel (after taking into account the potential for a "continuity of
interest" or similar agreement; provided, that, in any event, the Company will
disclose to Parent that it is withholding information in reliance upon this
Section 5.4), (x) disclose information that would cause significant
competitive harm to the Company or its Subsidiaries if the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, (y) violate applicable
Law, or (z) violate any confidentiality obligations to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is bound. All requests for such access shall be
directed to a Specified Company Employee or such other person as the Company
may designate in writing to Parent from time to time. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, prior to the Closing, without the express prior
written consent of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, neither Parent nor MergerSub, nor any of their advisors,
representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors or other agents
shall contact any customers to, or vendors or suppliers of, the Company, or
shall have  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tany right to perform sampling or any invasive or subsurface
investigations of any properties or facilities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. In exercising its rights hereunder, Parent shall, and shall
cause its advisors, representatives, officers, directors, employees, auditors
and other agents to conduct themselves so as not to unreasonably interfere in
the conduct of the Business of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing. Parent shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly reimburse the
Company for any loss or damage arising from or caused by Parent's exercise of
its rights under this Section 5.4 and shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries from and against any claims,
liabilities, damages, judgments or expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) incurred by any of them relating to any injury or damage to any Person
or property arising or resulting therefrom. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.5 Commercially Reasonable Efforts. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate and use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill as promptly as
practicable the conditions precedent to the parties' obligations hereunder
that are within their respective control. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.5(a), the
Company and Parent shall make all filings, applications and submissions
required by the HSR Act or any other applicable competition Laws no later than
ten (10) Business Days following the date of this Agreement, and promptly file
any additional information requested as soon as practicable after receipt of
such request therefor. In connection with any filing, application or
submission under the HSR Act or any other applicable competition Law: (i) the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and shall furnish to the
other party all information necessary or desirable in connection with making
any filing, application or submission under the HSR Act or any other
applicable competition Law, and in connection with resolving any investigation
or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity under any competition Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) each of the
Company and Parent shall promptly inform the other of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such filing, application or submission, or
any such investigation or other inquiry; (iii) neither the Company nor Parent
shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any such filing, application, submission, investigation or other inquiry
without giving the other party reasonable prior notice of the meeting and, if
requested by the other party, the Company or Parent (as applicable) shall
request that the other party be permitted to attend the meeting; and (iv) each
of the Company and Parent shall consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either
such party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to the HSR Act or any other applicable competition Laws; provided,
however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
neither the Company nor Parent (nor their respective ultimate parent entities,
as such term is used in the HSR Act) shall be required to disclose to any
other party, any information contained in its HSR Notification and Report Form
(or other applicable form, filing, application or submission made or submitted
under any other applicable competition Law) which such party, in its sole and
reasonable discretion, deems  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tconfidential. Each of Parent and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
termination or expiration of the waiting periods under the HSR Act and any
other applicable competition Laws as promptly as possible after the date of
this Agreement (including, without limitation, specifically requesting early
termination of the waiting period prescribed by the HSR Act or other
applicable competition Laws). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent agrees to
take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under the HSR Act and any other applicable competition Laws that
may be asserted by any Governmental Entity or any other Person so as to enable
the parties to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated hereby,
including consenting to any divestiture of assets or other structural or
conduct relief in order to obtain clearance from any Governmental Entity under
the HSR Act and any other applicable competition Laws and, at the request of
the Company, Parent and its Affiliates shall be obligated to contest,
administratively or in court, any ruling, order or other Action of any
Governmental Entity or any other Person respecting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each party shall bear its own costs in
connection with the preparation or the making of any filing under the HSR Act
or any other applicable competition Law, or resolving any investigation or
other inquiry by any Governmental Entity under the HSR Act or any other
applicable competition Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, that Parent shall be solely responsible for the
payment of any applicable filing fees under the HSR Act and any other
applicable competition Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.6 Director and Officer Liability; Indemnification. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) After the Effective Time, all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and reimbursement and advancement of expenses, and all
limitations on liability, existing in favor of any current or former officer
or member of the board of directors or board of managers (or comparable
governing body) of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "Company Indemnitees"), as provided in the articles or certificate of
incorporation or formation, limited liability company agreement, by-laws or
other organizational documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
and/or in any agreements or arrangements of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries providing for similar rights and limitations in favor of any of
the Company Indemnitees, in any such case as in effect as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall survive the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and continue in full force and effect, and Parent shall,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of its Subsidiaries
to, honor all such rights and limitations after the Effective Time in
accordance with their terms. All such rights of exculpation, indemnification
and reimbursement and advancement of expenses, and all such limitations on
liability, shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any Company Indemnitee without the consent of such affected
Company Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Company Indemnitees
shall be third party beneficiaries of this Section 5.6). From and after the
Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Subsidiaries of the
Surviving Corporation shall pay all costs and expenses to any Company
Indemnitee, as incurred, in connection with enforcing the exculpation,
indemnity, reimbursement, advancement, limitations or other rights or
obligations provided for in this Section 5.6(a). \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t\t55  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) At the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, obtain, maintain and fully pay
for irrevocable "tail" officers' and directors' liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance policies naming the Company Indemnitees as
direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years after the
Effective Time in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Closing Date, such insurance policies to contain terms with respect to
coverage and to be in an amount not less favorable than the officers' and
directors' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policies
maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of
this Agreement and shall be reviewed by, and approved in advance by, the
Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). In satisfying its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.6(b),
the Surviving Corporation will not be obligated to pay annual premiums in
excess of 300% of the amount paid by the Company for coverage for its last
full fiscal year (such 300% amount, the "Maximum Annual Premium"). If the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed the Maximum Annual Premium,
then the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual
Premium from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Company's current directors' and officers' liability insurance carrier. In the
event that any Company Indemnitee is entitled to coverage under any such
officers' and directors' liability insurance policy or fiduciary liability
insurance policy pursuant to this Section 5.6(b) and any such policy has
lapsed, terminated, been repudiated or is otherwise in breach or default as a
result of Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or any of its Subsidiaries'
failure to maintain and fulfill its obligations pursuant to such policy,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary to,
pay to the Company Indemnitee such amounts and provide any other coverage or
benefits as the Company Indemnitee shall have received pursuant to such
policy. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The articles of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of former or present
directors and officers than are presently set forth in the articles of
incorporation and by-laws of the Company in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such
individuals. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective successors
or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or its applicable Subsidiary (or their respective successors and assigns)
shall assume in writing the obligations set forth in this Section 5.6. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any
proceeding (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) with
respect to which a Company Indemnitee would be entitled to rights to
exculpation, indemnification, reimbursement and  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t56  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tadvancement of expenses and any limitations on liability under the
applicable articles or certificate of incorporation or formation, limited
liability company agreement, by-laws or other organizational documents of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and/or in any agreements or arrangements
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries providing for similar rights and
limitations in favor of any of the Company Indemnitees, is made against any
Company Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective
Time, the provisions and benefits of this Section 5.6 shall continue in full
effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other rights to which a Company Indemnitee is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, Contract or otherwise. The provisions of this Section
5.6 shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, and expressly are intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnitees and their respective heirs and legal
representatives. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company may, at any time and from time to time after the
date of this Agreement, supplement or amend any of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, or may add any additional Company Disclosure Schedules for
informational purposes only and without limiting Parent's rights pursuant to
this Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VI and the Effective
Time, the Company will give prompt notice to Parent upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by it in this Agreement has become untrue
or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by the Company to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement,
in each case if and only to the extent that such untruth, inaccuracy, or
failure would reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of Parent and MergerSub to consummate the Merger set forth in
Section 4.1(a)(i) or Section 4.1(a)(ii) to fail to be satisfied at the
Closing, except that no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify
any representation or warranty of the Company set forth in this Agreement or
the conditions to the obligations of Parent and MergerSub to consummate the
Merger or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) At all times during the period commencing with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article V and the Effective
Time, Parent will give prompt notice to the Company upon becoming aware that
any representation or warranty made by Parent or MergerSub in this Agreement
has become untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or of any failure by
Parent or MergerSub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case if and only to the extent that such
untruth, inaccuracy or failure  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\twould reasonably be expected to cause any of the conditions to the
obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger set forth in Section
4.2(a)(i) or Section 4.2(a)(ii) to fail to be satisfied at the Closing, except
that no such notification will affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty of Parent or MergerSub set forth in this Agreement
or the conditions to the obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger
or the remedies available to the Parties under this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.8 No Solicitation. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) After the date of this Agreement and until the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, the Company will
cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any
Person or its Affiliates, directors, officers, managers, employees,
consultants, agents, Financing Sources, attorneys, accounting, representatives
and other advisors that would be prohibited by this Section 5.8, request the
prompt return or destruction of all non-public information concerning the
Company or its Subsidiaries theretofore furnished to any such Person with whom
a confidentiality agreement was entered into at any time within the six month
period immediately preceding the date of this Agreement and will (A) cease
providing any further information with respect to the Company or any
Acquisition Proposal to any such Person or its directors, officers, managers,
employees, consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other
advisors and representatives (the "Representatives"); and (B) terminate all
access granted to any such Person and its Representatives to any physical or
electronic data room. After the date of this Agreement and until the earlier
of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall not instruct,
authorize or knowingly permit its and its Subsidiaries' Representatives to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, propose or induce the making of,
or knowingly encourage, any proposal, inquiry or offer that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) engage
in, continue or otherwise participate in any external discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data, or
afford access to the business, employees, properties, assets, books, or
records of the Company, to any Person (other than to Parent, MergerSub or any
designees of Parent or MergerSub) relating to, or that would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal; (iii) knowingly facilitate any
effort or attempt to make an Acquisition Proposal; (iv) approve, endorse or
recommend any proposal that constitutes, or is reasonably expected to lead to,
an Acquisition Proposal; or (v) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract
relating to an Acquisition Proposal (except for a Comparable Confidentiality
Agreement) (any such letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger
agreement, acquisition agreement or other Contract relating to an Acquisition
Proposal, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval,
the Company, in response to any written Acquisition Proposal delivered to the
Company after the date of this Agreement that did not result from or arise in
connection with a material breach by the Company of Section 5.8(a), may
provide, if prior to providing such information the Company receives from the
Person so requesting such information an executed  \t\t

 \t\t\tComparable Confidentiality Agreement, information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to, and engage in discussions or negotiations
with, and afford access to the business, employees, properties, assets, books
and records of the Company to, the Person that submitted such written
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives, provided that the Board (or any
committee thereof) determines in good faith (after consultation with its
financial and legal advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or
could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Offer and that failure to
engage in such discussions or negotiations would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
provided, however, that the Company will promptly (and in any event within
one (1) Business Day) make available to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries that is provided to any such
Person or its Representatives that was not previously made available to
Parent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) The Company agrees that it shall promptly (and, in any
event, within one (1) Business Day) notify Parent of the receipt of any
inquiry, offer or proposal that constitutes as Acquisition Proposal which must
include (i) the identity of the Person or "group" of Persons making such offer
or proposal, (ii) copies of any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Acquisition Agreement related thereto, (iii) a summary of the material terms
and conditions of any unwritten Acquisition Proposal, and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of any material developments,
discussions or negotiations regarding any and all Acquisition Proposals. The
Company shall (A) promptly notify Parent of any scheduled meeting of the Board
(or any committee thereof) at which it is reasonably likely that the Board (or
any committee thereof) will consider any Acquisition Proposal, and (B)
promptly notify Parent of any determination by the Board (or any committee
thereof) that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Offer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Subject to paragraph (e) below, the Board shall not (i)
withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify (or publicly propose or resolve
to withhold, withdraw, qualify, amend or modify), in a manner adverse to
Parent or MergerSub, the recommendation by the Board of this Agreement or the
Merger, (ii) approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable or propose
or resolve to approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise), any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) take any formal action or make any
recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender or exchange
offer, other than a recommendation against such offer or a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the Company Board (or a committee thereof) to the
Company Shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange
Act (or any substantially similar communication) (it being understood that the
Company Board (or a committee thereof) may refrain from taking a position with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal until the close of business on the 10th
Business Day after the commencement of a tender or exchange offer in
connection with such Acquisition Proposal without such action being considered
a violation of this Section 5.8); (iv) fail to publicly reaffirm the Board
Recommendation within 10 Business Days after Parent so requests in writing (it
being understood that the Company will have no obligation to make such
reaffirmation on more than one occasion), or (v) fail to include the Company
Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement (any action described in clauses
(i) through (v), a "Change of Recommendation"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, prior to, but not after, the time the Company Shareholder Approval
is obtained, the Board may effect a Change of Recommendation in response to a
Superior Offer and/or terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.1(a)(viii) to enter into a definitive agreement to consummate a Superior
Offer as contemplated herein, which Superior Offer did not result from any
material breach by the Company of Section 5.8, if the Board (or any committee
thereof) determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, if and only if prior to any Change of Recommendation or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to
Parent and MergerSub, at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the
"Superior Offer Notice Period"), of the intention of the Board (or any
committee thereof) to effect a Change of Recommendation or to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii), which notice, if concerning an
intended Change of Recommendation in response to a Superior Offer or
concerning an intended termination pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(viii) of this
Agreement, shall specify the identity of the Person (or group of Persons)
making such Superior Offer and the material terms and conditions thereof (or
of any material modification thereto) and include an unredacted copy of the
Superior Offer and an unredacted copy of the then-current proposed draft
alternative acquisition agreements;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) if requested by Parent, the Company shall have negotiated
with, and shall have caused its representatives to negotiate with, Parent in
good faith during the Superior Offer Notice Period to make any bona fide
modifications proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
so that such Superior Offer would cease to constitute a "Superior Offer"
hereunder;  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) either (A) Parent shall not have, prior to the expiration
of the Superior Offer Notice Period, made a written offer to modify the terms
of this Agreement in a manner that would cause such Superior Offer to cease to
constitute a "Superior Offer" hereunder, which written offer would be binding
on Parent upon the Company's acceptance thereof or (B) the Board (or any
committee thereof) (after consulting with its outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel) shall have considered in good faith any changes to this
Agreement offered in writing by Parent to modify the terms of this Agreement,
and shall have determined that such Superior Offer continues to constitute a
Superior Offer if such changes were to be given effect and that failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood and
agreed that any change to the financial or other material terms of an
Acquisition Proposal that was previously the subject of a notice hereunder
shall require a new notice to Parent as provided above, but with respect to
any such subsequent notices references herein to "three (3) Business Days"
shall be deemed references to "one (1) Business Day"); and \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t60  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) in the event of any termination of this Agreement in order
to cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into a
definitive agreement to consummate a Superior Offer, the Company will have
validly terminated this Agreement in accordance with Section
6.1(a)(viii). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time
prior to (but not after) obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, the Board
(or any committee thereof) may make an Change of Recommendation in response to
a positive material event, occurrence, change, effect, condition, development
or state of facts or circumstances (other than related to an Acquisition
Proposal) arising after the date of this Agreement that (i) was neither known
to, nor reasonably foreseeable by, the Board prior to the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) does not relate to (A) any Acquisition Proposal or (B) the
mere fact, in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any internal or
published projections, forecasts, estimates or predictions of revenue,
earnings or other financial or operating metrics for any period ending on or
after the date of this Agreement, or changes after the date of this Agreement
in the market price or trading volume of the Common Stock or the credit rating
of the Company (an "Intervening Event") (it being understood that the
underlying cause of any of the foregoing in this clause (B) may be considered
and taken into account in determining whether an Intervening Event has
occurred), only if the Board (or any committee thereof) has determined in good
faith (after consultation with its financial and outside legal advisors) that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
exercise of their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however,
that no Change of Recommendation may be made unless (i) the Company shall have
provided prior written notice to Parent and MergerSub, at least three (3)
Business Days in advance, of the intention of the Board (or any committee
thereof) to effect a Change of Recommendation in response to an Intervening
Event and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such Change of
Recommendation and (ii) the Board (or any committee thereof) (after consulting
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) shall have
considered in good faith any changes to this Agreement offered in writing
by Parent with respect to an intended Change of Recommendation in response
to an Intervening Event, and shall have determined that the failure to make a
Change of Recommendation would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the
Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) from issuing a "stop,
look and listen" communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act or complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or from making any disclosure to the
Company's Shareholders required (after consultation with outside legal
advisors) under applicable Law, it being understood that nothing in the
foregoing will be deemed to permit the Company or the Board to effect a Change
of Recommendation other than in accordance with Section 5.8(e) or (f). For
the avoidance of doubt, a factually accurate public statement that describes
the Company's receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a Change of
Recommendation. \t\t

 \t\t\t(h) The Company agrees that any material breach of this Section
5.8 by any of its Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by the Company. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.9 Proxy Statement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tAs promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement (any
in any event within thirty (30) days), the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC the Proxy Statement in preliminary form. The Company may not file the
Proxy Statement or any Other Filing with the SEC without first providing
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon,
and the Company will give due consideration to all reasonable additions,
deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent or its counsel. Each of the
Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC all Other Filings, if
any, that are required pursuant to applicable Law to be filed by such party in
connection with the Merger, and the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement
(and all other proxy materials) to be mailed to the Shareholders as promptly
as practicable after the earlier of (x) receiving notification that the SEC or
its staff is not reviewing the Proxy Statement, (y) the expiration of the
10-day period after filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, in the event
the SEC has failed to affirmatively notify the Company within such period that
it will or will not be reviewing the Proxy Statement, or (z) the conclusion of
any SEC or staff review of the Proxy Statement. If necessary to comply with
applicable Law, after the Proxy Statement shall have been mailed, the Company
shall promptly circulate amended, supplemental or supplemented proxy material,
and, if required in connection therewith, resolicit proxies. On the date of
filing, the date of mailing to the Shareholders (if applicable) and at the
time of the Company Shareholder Meeting, neither the Proxy Statement nor any
Other Filing will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not false or misleading. The Company and its Affiliates, on the one
hand, and Parent, MergerSub and their respective Affiliates, on the other
hand, may not communicate in writing with the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing without first providing the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such written
communication, and each party will give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the other parties or
their respective counsel. The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
MergerSub, on the other hand, will advise the other, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff
for (i) any amendment or revisions to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing;
(ii) any receipt of comments from the SEC or its staff on the Proxy Statement
or any Other Filing; or (iii) any receipt of a request by the SEC or its staff
for additional information in connection therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.10 Company Shareholders' Meeting. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) The Company shall take all action necessary under all
applicable Law to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
Shareholders (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, (ii) the Company Shareholders'
Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable after the commencement of the
mailing of the Proxy Statement to the Shareholders, and (iii) Parent  \t\t

 \t\t\tshall cause all shares of Common Stock owned by Parent or MergerSub,
if any, to be voted in favor of the approval of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone the Company Shareholders' Meeting (x) to the
extent it reasonably believes is necessary to comply with any applicable Law
or (y) if as of the time for which the Company Shareholders' Meeting is
originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Common Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such Company Shareholders' Meeting or to obtain the
Company Shareholder Approval (it being understood that the Company may not
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholder Meeting more than two times
pursuant to this clause (y) without Parent's prior written consent). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) The Company shall establish a record date in accordance with
the Articles of Incorporation, the Bylaws, NASDAQ rules and applicable Law,
for purposes of determining the holders of Common Stock entitled to notice of
and vote at the Company Shareholders' Meeting (the "Record Date"). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Subject to Section 5.8 of this Agreement and provided there
shall not have been a Change of Recommendation in accordance with Section 5.8
of this Agreement, (i) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to the
effect that the Board (x) has determined and believes that the Merger is
advisable and fair to, and in the best interests of, the Company and its
Shareholders, (y) has approved this Agreement and the Merger, and (z)
recommends that the Shareholders vote to approve and adopt this Agreement and
the Merger at the Company Shareholders' Meeting, and (ii) the Company shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to solicit or cause to be solicited from
the Shareholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Merger (and any other matters required to be approved by the
Shareholders in connection with the consummation of the Merger).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 5.11 Financing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitment Letters on the terms set forth
therein, including using Parent's reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with
and maintain in full force and effect the Financing Commitment Letters in
accordance with the terms thereof, (ii) promptly negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms and
conditions contained in the Financing Commitment Letters (the "Definitive
Financing Agreements") (and comply with and maintain in effect the Definitive
Financing Agreements), (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to
obtaining the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitment Letters and the
Definitive Financing Agreements that are applicable to Parent and MergerSub,
and to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using
its reasonable best efforts to cause the sources of the Financing to fund the
Financing at the Closing, and (iv) enforce its rights under the Financing
Commitment Letter and Definitive Financing Agreements (provided that nothing
herein shall be construed to require Parent or MergerSub to seek specific
performance against any Financing Source). Parent shall provide the Company
with drafts  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(when available) and thereafter true and complete and executed copies
on or prior to the date of this Agreement of the Financing Commitment Letters
(including the Fee Letter which may be redacted as customary for financings of
this type) and shall give the Company prompt written notice upon becoming
aware of (A) any breach or default (or any event or circumstance which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any breach or default) by any party to the Financing Commitment
Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements, (B) any failure to carry out
any of the terms of the Financing Commitment Letters or any the Definitive
Financing Agreements by any party thereto, (C) any actual or threatened
withdrawal, rescission, termination or repudiation of any of the Financing
Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing Agreements by any party
thereto, (D) any material dispute or disagreement between or among any of the
parties to any of the Financing Commitment Letters or any Definitive Financing
Agreements, or (E) the occurrence of an event or development that Parent
expects to have a material and adverse impact on the ability of Parent to
obtain all or any portion of the Financing. Parent shall keep the Company
informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing contemplated by the Financing
Commitment Letters. Without the prior written consent of the Company, Parent
shall not (A) agree to or permit any amendment, supplement, replacement or
modification to be made to, or grant any waiver of, any provision or remedy
under, any of the Financing Commitment Letters, the Fee Letters or Definitive
Financing Agreement, if such amendment, supplement, replacement or
modification would or would be reasonably likely to (i) reduce the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing, as applicable, below the
amount required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) impose new or additional conditions precedent, or amend, expand or modify
the conditions precedent, to the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing or any
other terms of the Financing Commitment Letters in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the Closing or make the
funding of the Debt Financing or the Equity Financing materially less likely
to occur, or (iv) adversely impact the ability of Parent to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Financing Commitments or the Financing
Agreements (collectively, the "Restricted Commitment Letter Amendments")
(provided, that Parent or MergerSub, as applicable, may amend the Financing
Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities that have not executed the Financing Commitment
Letters as of the date hereof, but only if the addition of such additional
parties, individually or in the aggregate, would not result in (i) the
occurrence of a Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment, (ii) any waiver of any
right or remedy under the Commitment Letters if such waiver would result in
the occurrence of a Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment, or (iii) early
termination of the Financing Commitment Letters), or (B) directly or
indirectly take any action that would or would be reasonably expected to
result in the Financing not being available. Upon any amendment,
supplement, modification or replacement of, or waiver of, any Financing
Commitment or Definitive Financing Agreement in accordance with this Section
5.11(a), Parent shall deliver a copy thereof to the Company and references
herein to "Financing Commitments," "Debt Commitment Letter," "Equity
Commitment Letters" and "Definitive Financing Agreements" shall include and
mean such documents as amended, supplemented, modified, replaced or waived in
compliance with this Section 5.11(a), and references to "Financing," "Debt
Financing" and "Equity Financing"  \t\t

Commitments or Definitive Financing Agreements as amended, supplemented,
modified, replaced or waived in compliance with this Section 5.11(a), as
applicable. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Without limiting the effect of Section 5.11(c), if,
notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent to satisfy its
obligations under Section 5.11(a), the Debt Commitment Letter expires or are
terminated, or the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
otherwise becomes unavailable, in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent
shall (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination or
unavailability and the reasons therefor and/or the circumstances giving rise
thereto and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly, and in any event
prior to the Closing, to arrange for alternative financing from other sources
(which alternative financing shall be in an amount at least equal to the Debt
Financing or such unavailable portion thereof, which shall not include any
conditions to funding or availability that are more onerous than, or in
addition to, the conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter that
expired or terminated, or for which the Debt Financing contemplated thereby
became unavailable, and which shall not otherwise include terms that would
reasonably be expected to make the likelihood that the Alternative Debt
Financing would be funded less likely) (the "Alternative Debt Financing") to
replace the Debt Financing contemplated by the expired or terminated Debt
Commitment Letter(s) or which otherwise became unavailable, and to obtain a
new financing commitment letter with respect to such Alternative Debt
Financing (the "Alternative Debt Commitment Letters"), copies of which shall
be promptly provided to the Company (which Fee Letter may be redacted in a
customary manner (so long as the redaction does not cover terms that would
adversely affect the conditionality, availability or termination of the Debt
Financing)). It is understood and agreed by Parent that the failure to
arrange for such Alternative Debt Financing does not relieve Parent of any of
its obligations under this Agreement. In the event any Alternative Debt
Commitment Letters are obtained, (x) any reference in this Agreement to the
"Financing" or the "Debt Financing" shall mean the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letters as modified pursuant to clause (y) below and
(y) any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing Commitment Letters" or
the "Debt Commitment Letters" shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment
Letters to the extent not superseded by an Alternative Debt Commitment Letter
at the time in question and any Alternative Debt Commitment Letters to the
extent then in effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, at the sole
cost and expense of Parent, reasonably cooperate with and reasonably assist
the Parent and MergerSub in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing; provided, that such cooperation and assistance shall only be
required upon reasonable advance notice and in a manner as would not be
unreasonably disruptive to the business or operations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, and shall only include such matters that would customarily
be done in connection with the arrangement of credit facilities of the same
nature as the Debt Financing, including using its reasonable best efforts to
(i) to the extent not available in the Company Reports, furnish Parent with
the financial information required to be delivered pursuant to the Debt
Commitment Letter (including pursuant to paragraph 3 of Exhibit B thereof, and
including, to the extent not available in the Company Reports or otherwise
publicly filed, any information reasonably necessary to prepare the pro forma

pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter (or the analogous provision in any
amendment, restatement, amendment and restatement, replacement, substitution,
supplement or other modification thereof that is required or permitted
hereunder)), to the extent reasonably available to the Company, (ii)
facilitate obtaining executed payoff letters and releases of existing Liens
(to the extent required hereunder or in the Debt Commitment Letter), provided
that any obligations and releases of Liens contained in all such agreements
and documents shall be subject to the occurrence of the Closing Date and
become effective no earlier than the Closing Date, (iii) furnish (at least two
(2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) Parent with all documentation and
other information reasonably required or requested with respect to the Debt
Financing under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations to the extent requested in writing at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, (iv) assist in the preparation of
schedules and other disclosures required pursuant to the definitive financing
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (v) cooperate in
Parent and MergerSub's efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document relating to the Debt
Financing to the extent satisfaction thereof requires the cooperation, or is
within the control, of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
representatives (including assisting with the return and delivery of any
original stock certificates or other possessory collateral in the possession
of existing lenders or any other third party, and execution and delivery of
any payoff documentation as may be required to be delivered pursuant to the
Debt Commitment letter or any of the definitive financing documentation).
Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company's

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a) During the one- (1) year period immediately following the

based equity-based incentive opportunities) provided to such Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) other compensation and employee

equity-based incentive opportunities) that, with respect to each employee, are
substantially similar or greater in the aggregate to the compensation and
benefits provided to such employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under

foregoing, as of the Closing, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving

amounts under any benefit plans maintained by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation in which a Company Employee participates to the same extent and
for the same purpose as recognized by the Company and the analogous Company
Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
such service shall not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
take commercially reasonable efforts to, (i) waive any preexisting condition
limitations otherwise applicable to Company Employees and their eligible
dependents under any plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates that provides
health benefits in which Company Employees participate following the Closing,
other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such employees
as of the Closing Date under the analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) honor
any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Company
Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the
calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-
payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans of Parent or any of its
Affiliates in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in
the same plan year in which such deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket
maximums were incurred; and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to a
Company Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or after the Closing
Date, in each case to the extent such Company Employee or eligible dependent
had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement under an analogous Company
Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e) No provision of this Agreement shall (i) create any right in
any employee of the Company to continued employment by Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment or service of any
employee or other Person for any reason; (ii) require Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation to continue any Company Benefit Plans or prevent the
amendment, modification or termination thereof after the Closing Date; (iii)
confer upon any Company Employee or other Person any rights or remedies under
or by reason of this Agreement, including any right as a third party
beneficiary; or (iv) be treated as an adoption of or amendment to any
particular employee benefit plan of Parent or the Company. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b) Effect of Termination. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 6.1(a), then this Agreement shall become null and void
and of no further force or effect, and there shall be no liability or
obligation hereunder on the part of the Company, Parent, MergerSub or any of
their respective Affiliates, or any of their respective managers, directors,
stockholders, members, partners, officers, employees, agents, representatives,

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections
6.1(a)(vii) or 6.1(a)(viii), the Company will pay to Parent or its designee

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tafter termination of this Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent. The Company acknowledges
that the agreements contained in this Section 6.1(b)(ii) and in Section
6.1(b)(iii) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Company
Termination Fee when due pursuant to Section 6.1(b)(ii) or Section
6.1(b)(iii), as applicable, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or
any of its Affiliates commences a suit or other Action that results in a
judgment against the Company for the Company Termination Fee or any portion
thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent the costs and expenses (including
reasonable and documented attorneys' fees) of Parent or such Affiliate in
connection with such suit or other Action, together with interest on such
amount or portion thereof at the prime rate published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment, or a lesser rate that is the maximum permitted by applicable
Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii) If (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
Section 6.1(a)(ii), Section 6.1(a)(iii) or Section 6.1(a)(iv); (B) following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and prior to the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(a)(ii), Section 6.1(a)(iii) or Section
6.1(a)(iv), an Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or disclosed
or privately submitted to the Board and not withdrawn or otherwise abandoned;
and (C) within one year of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1(a)(ii), Section 6.1(a)(iii) or Section 6.1(a)(iv), as applicable,
either an Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into a
definitive agreement providing for an Acquisition Transaction and that
Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then the Company will
concurrently with the consummation of such Acquisition Transaction pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated by Parent. For purposes of this Section
6.1(b)(iii), all references to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Transaction" will be deemed to be references to "50%." \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Sections
6.1(a)(v) or 6.1(a)(ix), Parent will pay to the Company or its designee (as
directed by the Company) the Parent Termination Fee. If the Parent
Termination Fee is payable, such Parent Termination Fee shall be paid no later
than the second (2nd) Business Day after termination of this Agreement, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Company, it being understood that in no event shall the Parent Termination Fee
be payable on more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent Termination
Fee may be payable pursuant to more than one provision of this Agreement at
the same or at different times and upon the occurrence of different events.
Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 6.1(b)(iv)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, the Company would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if Parent fails to pay the Parent Termination Fee when
due and, in order to obtain such payment, the Company or any of its Affiliates
commences a suit or other Action that results in a judgment against Parent for
the  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tParent Termination Fee or any portion thereof, Parent shall pay to the
Company the costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented attorneys'
fees) of the Company or such Affiliate in connection with such suit or other
Action, together with interest on such amount or portion thereof at the prime
rate published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made through the date of payment, or a lesser rate that is
the maximum permitted by applicable Law. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(v) After termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections
6.1(a)(vii) or Section 6.1(a)(viii), Parent's right to receive payment of the
Company Termination Fee from the Company pursuant to Section 6.1(b) shall,
upon full payment to Parent of the Company Termination Fee, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent, MergerSub, Guarantor and their respective
Affiliates, former, current and future holders of any equity, controlling
persons, managers, directors, stockholders, optionholders members, general or
limited partners, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Financing Sources,
representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Parent Related
Parties") against the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates, managers, directors, shareholders, Optionholders, RSUholders,
Warrantholders, members, partners, officers, employees, agents, attorneys,
representatives, successors and assigns (collectively, the "Company Related
Parties") for any loss or damage relating to or arising out of this Agreement,
the failure to consummate the Merger or as a result of any breach of this
Agreement or any Transaction Document or any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained herein or therein by the Company or any other
Company Related Party prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 6.1(a) or the failure of the transactions contemplated hereby to be
consummated; provided, however, that the Company shall remain obligated for,
and Parent shall be entitled to remedies with respect to, the Confidentiality
Agreement, and the Company shall remain obligated for, and Parent shall be
entitled to remedies with respect to, the reimbursement and expense
obligations of the Company contained in the last sentence of Section
6.1(b)(ii). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vi) After termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections
6.1(a)(v) or 6.1(a)(ix), the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee from Parent pursuant to Section 6.1(b) shall, upon full
payment to the Company of the Parent Termination Fee, be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company Related Parties against the Parent Related
Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the failure to
consummate the Merger or as a result of any breach of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document or any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein or therein by Parent, MergerSub or any other Parent Related
Party, and upon payment of the Parent Termination Fee, to the extent owed to
the Company under this Agreement, (A) none of the Parent Related Parties will
have any further liability or obligation to the Company relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, any Transaction Documents (including the Commitment
Letters) or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters
forming the basis for such termination, and (B) neither the Company nor any
other Person will be entitled to bring or maintain any Action against Parent,
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t73  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tMergerSub or any other Parent Related Party arising out of this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents (including the Commitment Letters), the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or any matters forming the basis
for such termination; provided, however, that such parties shall remain
obligated for, and the Company shall be entitled to remedies with respect to,
the Confidentiality Agreement, and Parent shall remain obligated for, and the
Company shall be entitled to remedies with respect to, the reimbursement and
expense obligations of Parent contained in Sections 5.4 and 5.11(d), and the
last sentence of Section.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(vii) Each party acknowledges that (A) the agreements contained
in Section 6.1(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (B) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination
Fee are payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and,
therefore, each of the Company Termination and Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty but rather constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that
will compensate for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not have entered
into this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c) Following any termination of this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall survive and remain in full force and effect in
accordance with its terms. Nothing in this Section 6.1 shall be deemed to
impair the right of any party to bring any action or actions for specific
performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief (including the right of
any party to compel specific performance by another party of its obligations
under this Agreement) pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth
in, Section 7.16 prior to the valid termination of this Agreement, except
that, although the Company, in its sole discretion, may determine its choice
of remedies hereunder, including by pursuing specific performance in
accordance with, but subject to the limitations of, Section 7.18(a), under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both
specific performance of the type contemplated by Section 7.18(a) and any
monetary damages, including the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
under no circumstances will the collective monetary damages payable by Parent,
MergerSub or any of their Affiliates for breaches under this Agreement or the
Commitment Letters (taking into account the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee pursuant to this Agreement) exceed an amount equal to $8,264,000 (the
"Parent Liability Limitation"). In no event will any of the Company Related
Parties seek or obtain, nor will they permit any of their Representatives or
any other Person acting on their behalf to seek or obtain, nor will any Person
be entitled to seek or obtain, any monetary recovery, fee or award in excess
of the Parent Liability Limitation against any of the Parent Related Parties,
and in no event will the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be entitled to
seek or obtain any monetary damages of any kind, including consequential,
special, indirect or punitive damages, in excess of the Parent Liability
Limitation against the Parent Related Parties for, or with respect to, this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters or the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(including, any breach by the Guarantor, Parent or MergerSub), the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the Merger or any
claims or actions under applicable Law arising out of any such breach,
termination or failure. Other than the Guarantor's obligations under the
Equity Commitment Letter and other than the obligations of Parent and
MergerSub to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, in no event will
any Parent Related Party or any other Person other than Parent and MergerSub
have any liability for monetary damages to the Company or any other Person
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.2 Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law shall become
applicable to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement after the date of this Agreement, each of the Company and Parent and
members of their respective boards of directors (or similar governing bodies)
shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are reasonably necessary
so that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated herein and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. \t\t

rights hereunder are not assignable, directly or indirectly (by operation of
Law or otherwise), unless such assignment is consented to in writing by both
Parent and the Company, and any attempted assignment without the required

without such consent and upon written notice to the Company assign their
rights hereunder or under any instrument executed or delivered in connection
herewith as collateral security to any lender or any other Financing Source
providing financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
which assignment shall not relieve Parent or MergerSub of any of their
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and
all the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns. \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the
Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules hereto) and the other Transaction Documents
constitute the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements, representations,
warranties, promises, statements and understandings between the parties with
respect to such subject matter; provided, however, that this Agreement shall
not supersede the terms and provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, which
shall survive and remain in effect until expiration or termination thereof in
accordance with its terms and this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.11 Interpretation. When a reference is made to an
Article, Section, subsection, clause, Schedule, Annex or Exhibit, such
reference shall be to an Article, Section, subsection, clause, Schedule, Annex
or Exhibit of or to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, such
words shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." Any
references to the masculine, feminine or neuter gender shall include such
other genders and any references to the singular or plural shall include the
other, in each case unless the context otherwise requires. Any reference to
this "Agreement" or any other agreement, document or other contract referred
to herein or on any annex, schedule or exhibit hereto shall be construed as a
reference to this Agreement or, as the case may be, such other agreement,
document or contract, as the same may have been, or may from time to time be,
amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, together with all annexes,
schedules and exhibits to this Agreement or such other agreement, document or
contract (as the case may be), in each case unless the reference specifically
provides otherwise. The terms "Dollars" and "$" mean United States Dollars,
and all payments to be made by Parent, MergerSub or the Company under or
pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be made in United States
Dollars. Information, documents and materials relating to the Shareholders,
the Awardholders, the Warrantholders, the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
other matter shall be considered "made available" or "provided" (or words or
phrases of a similar import or nature) to Parent as of the date of this
Agreement if such information, documents and/or materials have been posted to
the electronic data room(s) established by the Company at
http://us1.merrillcorp.com at least one (1) day prior to the date of this
Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto,
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this
Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.12 Disclosure. Any exception, qualification or other
disclosure set forth on the Company Disclosure Schedules with respect to a
particular representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement
shall be deemed to be an exception, qualification or other disclosure with
respect to all other representations, warranties and covenants contained in
this Agreement to the extent any description of facts regarding the event,
item or matter disclosed is adequate so as to make reasonably apparent on its
face that such exception, qualification or disclosure is applicable to such
other representations, warranties or covenants whether or not such exception,
qualification or disclosure makes reference to such other representations,
warranties or covenants or any of their Section references. The inclusion of
information in any of the Company  \t\t

information is material to the Business, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.13 Waiver and Amendment. Any provision of this Agreement
may be amended, supplemented, waived or modified if, and only if, any such
amendment, supplement or modification is in writing and signed by the Company
and Parent, or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver
is to be effective; provided that after execution of the approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the Shareholders, no amendment shall be made that
by Law requires further approval by the Shareholders without obtaining such
required approval under the WBCL. No failure or delay by any party in
exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall
the provisions relating to the Financing Sources set forth in Section 6.1(b),
Section 6.1(d), Section 7.3, Section 7.5, Section 7.15, Section 7.17 or
Section 7.18 (and in each case, the defined terms used or defined therein) be
amended, modified or altered without the prior written consent of such
Financing Sources. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.14 Counterparts; Facsimile and PDF Signatures. This
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when
executed, shall be deemed to be an original and all of which together will be
deemed to be one and the same instrument binding upon all of the parties
hereto notwithstanding the fact that all parties are not signatory to the
original or the same counterpart. For purposes of this Agreement, facsimile
and portable document format signatures shall be deemed originals. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.15 Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement is for the
sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, and nothing herein, express or implied, shall give or be
construed to give to any other Person any legal or equitable rights hereunder,
except that (a) each Company Indemnitee shall be a third party beneficiary of
Section 5.6, (b) each Company Related Party shall be a third party beneficiary
of Section 6.1(b)(v), (c) each Parent Related Party shall be a third party
beneficiary of Section 6.1(b)(vi) and Section 6.1(d), and (d) any party listed
in Section 7.17(b) shall be a third party beneficiary of Section 7.17(b). The
provisions of Section 6.1(b), Section 6.1(d), Section 7.3, Section 7.5,
Section 7.15, Section 7.17 and Section 7.18 will inure to the benefit of the
Financing Sources and their successors and permitted assigns, each of whom are
intended to be third party beneficiaries thereof (it being understood and
agreed that the provisions of such Sections will be enforceable by the
Financing Sources and their respective successors and permitted
assigns). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.16 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement or
the application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision hereof. The Parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.17 Non-Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced
against the named parties hereto (subject to the terms, conditions and other
limitations set forth herein), and (a) all claims or causes of action that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the  \t\t

 \t\t\tnegotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, the
termination of this Agreement, the failure to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable Laws arising out
of any such breach, termination or failure, may be made only against the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties hereto and (b) no past,
present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member,
general or limited partner, stockholder, Financing Source, controlling person,
Optionholder, RSUholder, Warrantholder, trustee, Affiliate, agent, attorney,
successors and assigns or representative of any party hereto (including any
person negotiating or executing this Agreement on behalf of a party hereto)
shall have any liability or obligation with respect to this Agreement or any
of the other Transaction Documents or with respect to any claim or cause of
action that may arise out of or relate to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement. Nothing in this Section 7.17 shall be deemed to alter, modify,
replace or limit the terms, provisions and agreements set forth in Section
7.1. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the Financing
Sources will have any liability to the Company or any of its Affiliates
relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing or otherwise,
whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise, and neither the
Company nor any of its Affiliates shall have any rights or claims against any
of the Financing Sources hereunder or thereunder (provided that nothing herein
shall limit the rights of the Company and its Affiliates from and after the
Effective Time under any Debt Commitment Letter or Definitive Financing
Arrangements (but not, for the avoidance of doubt, this Agreement) to the
extent the Company and/or such Affiliate(s) are party thereto). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.18 Specific Performance. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)The Company, Parent and MergerSub acknowledge and agree that (a)
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or are
otherwise breached or threatened to be breached, and (b) remedies at law would
not be adequate to compensate the non-breaching party. Accordingly, each of
the Company, Parent and MergerSub agree that, prior to any valid termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Section 6.1 and subject in all respects
to this Section 7.18, each of them shall have the right, in addition to any
other rights and remedies existing in its favor, to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of
this Agreement and to enforce its rights hereunder not only by an action or
actions for damages but also by an action or actions for specific performance,
injunctive and/or other equitable relief without the necessity of proving the
inadequacy of money damages as a remedy. The right to equitable relief,
including specific performance and injunctive relief, shall exist
notwithstanding, and shall not be limited by, any other provision of this
Agreement except as provided in this Section 7.18 and, following a termination
of this Agreement, in Section 6.1(b). Each of the Company, Parent and
MergerSub hereby waives any defense that a remedy at law is adequate and any
requirement to post bond or other security in connection with actions
instituted for injunctive relief, specific performance or other equitable
remedies. Each of the Company, Parent and MergerSub hereby agrees not to
assert that specific performance, injunctive and other equitable remedies are
unenforceable, violate public policy, are invalid, are contrary to Law or are
inequitable for any reason. The right of specific performance, injunctive and
other equitable remedies is an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and without that right, none of the Company, Parent or
 \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t80  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tMergerSub would have entered into this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything else to the contrary, the parties hereto hereby
acknowledge and agree that the Company shall only be entitled to specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to cause Parent to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the
Closing in accordance with Article II, if (i) all conditions in Section 4.1
(other than those conditions which are to be satisfied only on the Closing
Date but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions) have been
satisfied or waived, (ii) Parent fails to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 2.8(a), (iii) the
Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent that (A) if specific
performance is granted and the Debt Financing or Alternative Debt Financing
and the Equity Financing were funded, then it will take such actions that are
required of it by this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur, and (B) the
Company is prepared, willing and able to effect the Closing, and (iv) the Debt
Financing (or Alternative Debt Financing) has been funded, or will be funded
at the Closing (if the Equity Financing is funded), or the Financing Sources
have irrevocably confirmed to Parent in writing that the Debt Financing will
be funded and available at the Closing (if the Equity Financing is
funded). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Without limiting the obligations of the Financing Sources under the
Debt Commitment Letter and the rights of Parent and MergerSub under the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Company acknowledges and agrees that in no event shall
the Company be entitled to seek a remedy of specific performance or other
equitable remedies against any lender-related party (including such Financing
Sources and its respective Affiliates, and the respective officers, directors,
employees, partners, trustees, stockholders, controlling persons, agents and
representatives of the foregoing, and their respective successors and
assigns). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tSection 7.19 Limited Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, to comply with Treas. Reg. Section
1.6011-4(b)(3)(i), the Company, the Shareholders, the Optionholders and Parent
(and any employee, representative or other agent of the foregoing) may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the United
States federal income tax treatment and structure of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (including opinions or other tax analyses that
are provided to any of them relating to such tax treatment and tax structure).
However, any such information relating to the tax treatment or tax structure
is required to be kept confidential to the extent necessary to comply with any
applicable federal or state securities laws. For this purpose, tax treatment
and tax structure shall not include (a) the name of, or any other identifying
information regarding the Shareholders, the Awardholders or Parent (or any
affiliate thereof), (b) any specific pricing information or (c) other
nonpublic business or financial information (including, without limitation,
the amount of any fees, expenses, rates or payments) that is not relevant to
an understanding of the tax treatment of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. \t\t
