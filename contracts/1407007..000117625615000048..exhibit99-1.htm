        | (i)    |   

the Final Order shall include a statement to substantially the following
effect: 

        |    |

distribution of the Tahoe Shares and the Replacement Options pursuant to the

     2.12   | _U.S. Tax Matters_ 

  

The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code and this Agreement and
the Plan of Arrangement are intended to be a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the
Code for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. Each party hereto shall
treat the Arrangement as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code for all U.S. federal income tax purposes, and shall treat this
Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement as a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of the U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 368 of the
Code, and shall not take any position on any Return or otherwise take any Tax
reporting position inconsistent with such treatment, unless otherwise required
by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code that such
treatment is not correct. Each Party hereto shall act in a manner that is
consistent with the Parties' intention that the Arrangement be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for all U.S.
federal income tax purposes, and shall not take any action, or knowingly fail
to take any action, if such action or failure to act would reasonably be
expected to prevent the Arrangement from qualifying as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

the original agreement of the parties in the circumstances. For greater
certainty, if Rio Alto takes any of the actions referred to above, the
aggregate consideration to be paid by Tahoe shall be decreased by an
equivalent amount.

Rio Alto, Tahoe and the Depositary will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration otherwise payable to any Rio Alto Shareholder under the
Plan of Arrangement (including any payment to Dissenting Rio Alto
Shareholders) such amounts as Rio Alto, Tahoe or the Depositary is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Tax Act, the Code,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of any
provincial, state, local or foreign tax Law as counsel may advise is required
to be so deducted and withheld by Rio Alto, Tahoe or the Depositary, as the
case may be. For the purposes hereof, all such withheld amounts shall be

and withholding was made on account of the obligation to make payment to such
person hereunder, provided that such deducted or withheld amounts are actually
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority by or on behalf of Rio
Alto, Tahoe or the Depositary, as the case may be. To the extent necessary,
such deductions and withholdings may be effected by selling any Rio Alto

remittance shall be paid to the person entitled thereto as soon as reasonably

affiliates following completion of the Arrangement. Without limiting the
generality of the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, Tahoe

Agreement will supersede those of the

  
    
  

  

Confidentiality Agreement but only to the extent of the conflict or
inconsistency and all other provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.

(a) Tahoe will, or will cause Rio Alto and its subsidiaries to, maintain in

insurance providing protection no less favourable to the protection provided
by the policies maintained by Rio Alto and its subsidiaries which are in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Date and providing protection in
respect of claims arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to
the Effective Date; provided, however, arising from facts or events which
occurred on or prior to the Effective Date, Rio Alto may, in the alternative,
purchase run off directors' and officers' liability insurance for a period of
up to six years from the Effective Date at a cost not exceeding 200% of Rio
Alto's current annual

  
    
  

  

aggregate premium for directors' and officers' liability policies currently
maintained by Rio Alto.

  

(b) The Parties agree that all rights to indemnification existing in favour of
the present and former directors and officers of Rio Alto (each such present
or former director or officer of Rio Alto being herein referred to as an
"Indemnified Party" and such persons collectively being referred to as the
"Indemnified Parties") as provided by Contracts or agreements to which Rio
Alto is a party and in effect as of the date hereof, which are fully and
completely disclosed in Rio Alto Disclosure Letter and copies of which have
been provided to Tahoe, and, as of the Effective Time, will survive and will
continue in full force and effect and without modification, and Rio Alto and
any successor to Rio Alto (including any Surviving Corporation) shall continue
to honour such rights of indemnification and indemnify the Indemnified Parties
pursuant thereto, with respect to actions or omissions of the Indemnified
Parties occurring prior to the Effective Time, for six years following the
Effective Date.

  

            | 
---|--- 
     4.9   | _Reorganization_ 

  

(a) Rio Alto shall effect such reorganization of its business, operations,
subsidiaries and assets or such other transactions (each, a "Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization") as Tahoe may reasonably request prior to the Effective Date,
and the Plan of Arrangement, if required, shall be modified accordingly;
provided, however, that Rio Alto need not effect a Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization which would impede or materially delay the consummation of the
Arrangement.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing and other than as set forth in clause (a)
above, Rio Alto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
necessary consents, approvals or waivers from any persons to effect each Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization, and Rio Alto shall cooperate with Tahoe in
structuring, planning and implementing any such Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization. Tahoe shall provide written notice to Rio Alto of any proposed
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization at least ten Business Days prior to the date of
the Rio Alto Meeting. In addition:

            | (i)   |   

any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not unreasonably interfere in Rio
Alto's material operations prior to the Effective Time; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (ii)   |   

any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not require Rio Alto to contravene
any applicable Laws, its organizational documents or any Rio Alto Material
Contract; and 

        |    |    

        | (iii)   |   

Rio Alto shall not be obligated to take any action that could result in any
Taxes being imposed on, or any adverse Tax or other consequences to, any Rio
Alto Shareholder incrementally greater than the Taxes or other consequences to
such party in connection with the consummation of the Arrangement in the
absence of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. 

  

(c) Tahoe acknowledges and agrees that the planning for and implementation of
any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization shall not be considered a breach of any
covenant under this Agreement and shall not be considered in determining
whether a representation or warranty of Rio Alto hereunder has been breached.
Tahoe and Rio Alto shall work cooperatively and use commercially reasonable
efforts to prepare prior to the Effective Time all documentation

  
    
  

  

necessary and do such other acts and things as are necessary to give effect to
such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization. For greater certainty, Rio Alto shall not
be liable for the failure of Tahoe to benefit from any anticipated Tax
efficiency as a result of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization.

  

(d) If the Arrangement is not completed, Tahoe will forthwith reimburse Rio
Alto for all reasonable fees and expenses actually incurred by Rio Alto in
considering and effecting a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization and shall be
responsible for the reasonable costs actually incurred by Rio Alto in
reversing or unwinding any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization that was effected at
Tahoe's request. The obligation of Tahoe to reimburse Rio Alto as set out in
this section will be in addition to any other obligation and shall survive
termination of this Agreement indefinitely.

shall cause its Representatives to not, directly or indirectly through any
other person:

            | (i)    |   

make, initiate, solicit, promote, entertain or encourage (including by way of
furnishing or affording access to information or any site visit), or take any
other action that facilitates, directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the
making of any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
that reasonably could be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal; or

        |    |    

        | (ii)    |   

participate, directly or indirectly, in any discussions or negotiations with,
furnish information to, or otherwise co-operate in any way with, any person
(other than Tahoe and its subsidiaries) regarding an Acquisition Proposal or
that reasonably could be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal it being
acknowledged and agreed to by Tahoe that the Rio Alto may communicate with any
Person for the purposes of clarifying the terms of any proposal, advising such
Person of the existence of this Agreement or advising such Person that their
proposal does not constitute a Superior Proposal and is not reasonably
expected to constitute or lead to a Superior Proposal; or 

        |    |    

        | (iii)    |   

remain neutral with respect to, or agree to, approve or recommend, or propose
publicly to agree to, approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal (it being
understood that publicly taking no position or a neutral position with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal for a period exceeding five Business Days after
such Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced shall be deemed to
constitute a violation of this Section 5.1(a)(iii)); or 

        |    |    

        | (iv)    |   

make or propose publicly to make a Change of Recommendation unless a Tahoe
Material Adverse Effect has occurred, and in the opinion of the Rio 

        |    |    

  
    
  

  

Alto Board, acting in good faith and after receiving advice from its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, the board is required to make a
Change in Recommendation in order to comply with its fiduciary duties; or

            | (v)   |   

accept, enter into, or propose publicly to accept or enter into, any
agreement, understanding or arrangement effecting or related to any
Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement permitted by and in accordance with
Section 5.1(c)); or 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (vi)   |   

make any public announcement or take any other action inconsistent with, or
that could reasonably be likely to be regarded as detracting from, the
approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Rio Alto Board
of the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

(b) Rio Alto and its Representatives and its subsidiaries and their
Representatives shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation with any person (other
than Tahoe and its subsidiaries) conducted heretofore by Rio Alto or any of
its Representatives or its subsidiaries or any of their Representatives with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal and, in connection therewith, Rio Alto
will discontinue access to any of its confidential information, including
access to any data room, virtual or otherwise, to any person (other than
access by Tahoe and its Representatives).

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.1(a), in
the event that Rio Alto receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
from any person after the date hereof and prior to the Rio Alto Meeting that
was not solicited by Rio Alto and that did not otherwise result from a breach
of this Section 5.1, and subject to Rio Alto's compliance with Section 5.1(d),
Rio Alto and its Representatives may (i) contact such person solely to clarify
the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish
information with respect to it to such person pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that (x) Rio Alto provides a copy of such

(y) Rio Alto contemporaneously provides to Tahoe any non-public information
concerning Rio Alto that is provided to such person which was not previously
provided to Tahoe or its Representatives, and (iii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding such Acquisition Proposal; provided,
however, that, prior to taking any action described in clauses (ii) or (iii)
above, the Rio Alto Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal would be reasonably likely, if consummated in accordance with its
terms, to be a Superior Proposal.

  

(d) Rio Alto will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Tahoe,
at first orally and thereafter in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal
(whether or not in writing) received by Rio Alto, any inquiry received by Rio
Alto that could reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or
any request received by Rio Alto for non-public information relating to Rio
Alto in connection with an Acquisition Proposal or for access to the
properties, books or records of Rio Alto by any person that informs Rio Alto
that it is considering making an Acquisition Proposal, and such notice will
include a copy of the Acquisition Proposal, a description of the material
terms and conditions of such inquiry or request and the identity of the

  
    
  

  

person making such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request, and promptly
provide to Tahoe such other information concerning such Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry or request as Tahoe may reasonably request. Rio Alto will keep Tahoe
promptly and fully informed of the status and details (including all
amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request.

  

(e) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.1, neither the Rio Alto
Board, nor any committee thereof shall permit Rio Alto to accept or enter into
any Acquisition Agreement requiring Rio Alto to abandon, terminate or fail to
consummate the Arrangement or providing for the payment of any break,
termination or other fees or expenses to any person proposing an Acquisition
Proposal in the event that Rio Alto completes the transactions contemplated
hereby or any other transaction with Tahoe or any of its affiliates.

  

(f) Notwithstanding Section 5.1, in the event Rio Alto receives a _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal that is a Superior Proposal from any person after the
date hereof and prior to the Rio Alto Meeting, then the Rio Alto Board may,
prior to the Rio Alto Meeting, withdraw, modify, qualify or change in a manner
adverse to Tahoe its approval or recommendation of the Arrangement and/or
approve or recommend such Superior Proposal or enter into an Acquisition
Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal but only if:

            | (i)    |   

Rio Alto has given written notice to Tahoe that it has received such Superior
Proposal and that the Rio Alto Board has determined that (x) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and (y) the Rio Alto Board intends to
withdraw, modify, qualify or change in a manner adverse to Tahoe its approval
or recommendation of the Arrangement (including the recommendation that the
Rio Alto Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement Resolution), and/or
enter into an Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal in
each case promptly following the making of such determination, together with a
summary of the material terms of any proposed Acquisition Agreement or other
agreement relating to such Superior Proposal (together with a copy of such
agreement and any ancillary agreements) to be executed with the person making
such Superior Proposal, and, if applicable, a written notice from the Rio Alto
Board regarding the value or range of values in financial terms that the Rio
Alto Board has, in consultation with its financial advisors, determined should
be ascribed to any non-cash consideration offered in the Superior Proposal; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (ii)    |   

a period of five full Business Days (such period being the "Superior Proposal
Notice Period") shall have elapsed from the date Tahoe received the notice
from Rio Alto referred to in Section 5.1(f)(i) and, if applicable, the notice
from the Rio Alto Board with respect to any non-cash consideration as
contemplated in Section 5.1(f)(i), together with the summary of material terms
and copies of agreements referred to therein. During the Superior Proposal
Notice Period, Tahoe shall have the right, but not the obligation, to propose
to amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement; 

  
    
  

            | (iii)   |   

Rio Alto did not breach any provision of this Section 5.1 in connection with
the preparation or making of such Acquisition Proposal and Rio Alto has
complied with the other terms of this Section 5.1(f); 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (iv)    |   

the Rio Alto Board shall have determined in accordance with Section 5.1(g)
that such Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal compared to the
Arrangement as proposed to be amended by Tahoe; 

        |    |    

        | (v)   |   

Rio Alto concurrently terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.1(d)(i);
and 

        |    |    

        | (vi)    |   

Rio Alto has previously, or concurrently will have, paid to Tahoe the
Termination Fee. 

  

(g) The Rio Alto Board will review in good faith any offer made by Tahoe to
amend the terms of this Agreement and the Arrangement in order to determine,
in consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, whether
the proposed amendments would, upon acceptance, result in the Acquisition
Proposal previously constituting a Superior Proposal ceasing to be a Superior
Proposal. Rio Alto agrees that, subject to Rio Alto's disclosure obligations
under applicable Securities Laws, the fact of the making of, and each of the
terms of, any such proposed amendments shall be kept strictly confidential and
shall not be disclosed to any person (including without limitation, the person
having made the Superior Proposal), other than Rio Alto's Representatives,
without Tahoe's prior written consent. If the Rio Alto Board determines that
such Acquisition Proposal would cease to be a Superior Proposal as a result of
the amendments proposed by Tahoe, Rio Alto will forthwith so advise Tahoe and
will promptly thereafter accept the offer by Tahoe to amend the terms of this
Agreement and the Arrangement and the Parties agree to take such actions and
execute such documents as are necessary to give effect to the foregoing. If
the Rio Alto Board continues to believe in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal remains a Superior Proposal and therefore rejects Tahoe's offer to
amend this Agreement and the Arrangement, if any, Rio Alto may, subject to
compliance with the other provisions hereof, terminate this Agreement in
accordance with Section 6.1(d)(i) to enter into an Acquisition Agreement in
respect of such Superior Proposal.

  

(h) Each successive modification of any Superior Proposal shall constitute a
new Superior Proposal for the purposes of Section 5.1(f) and shall require a
new five full Business Day Superior Proposal Notice Period from the date
described in Section 5.1(f)(ii) with respect to such new Superior Proposal. If
the Rio Alto Meeting is scheduled to occur during a Superior Proposal Notice
Period, upon the request of Tahoe, Rio Alto shall, adjourn or postpone the Rio
Alto Meeting to (i) a date specified by Tahoe that is not later than six
Business Days after the date on which the Rio Alto Meeting was originally
scheduled to be held, or (ii) if Tahoe does not specify such date to the sixth
day after the date on which the Rio Alto Meeting was originally scheduled to
be held.

  

(i) The Rio Alto Board shall reaffirm its recommendation in favour of the
Arrangement by news release promptly after (A) the Rio Alto Board has
determined that any Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal if the
Acquisition Proposal has been publicly

  
    
  

  

announced or made; or (B) the Rio Alto Board makes the determination referred
to in Section 5.1(g) that an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly
announced or made and which previously constituted a Superior Proposal has
ceased to be a Superior Proposal. Tahoe shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the form and content of any such news
release. Such news release shall state that the Rio Alto Board has determined
that such Acquisition Proposal is not a Superior Proposal.

  

(j) Rio Alto will not become a party to any Contract with any person
subsequent to the date hereof that limits or prohibits Rio Alto from (x)
providing or making available to Tahoe and its affiliates and Representatives
any information provided or made available to such person or its officers,
directors, employees, consultants, advisors, agents or other representatives
(including solicitors, accountants, investment bankers and financial advisors)
pursuant to any confidentiality agreement described in this Section 5.1 or (y)
providing Tahoe and its affiliates and Representatives with any other
information required to be given to it by Rio Alto under this Section 5.1.

  

(k) Rio Alto agrees (i) not to release any persons from, or terminate, modify,
amend or waive the terms of, any confidentiality agreement or standstill
agreement or standstill provisions in any such confidentiality agreement that
Rio Alto entered into prior to the date hereof, (ii) to promptly and
diligently enforce all standstill, non-disclosure, non-disturbance, non-
solicitation and similar covenants that it has entered into prior to the date
hereof or enter into after the date hereof (it being acknowledged and agreed
that the automatic termination of any standstill provisions of any such
agreement as the result of entering into and announcement of this Agreement
shall not be a violation of this Section 5.1(k)). Rio Alto shall forthwith, if
provided for in a confidentiality agreement with such person, request the
return or destruction of all information provided to any third party that, has
entered into a confidentiality agreement with Rio Alto to the extent that such
information has not previously been returned or destroyed, and shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such requests are honoured.

  

(l) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Section 5.1, the Rio Alto
Board shall have the right to respond, within the time and in the manner
required by applicable Securities Laws, to any take-over bid or tender or
exchange offer made for the Rio Alto Shares that it determines is not a
Superior Proposal.

  

(m) Rio Alto shall ensure that its Representatives are aware of the provisions
of this Section 5.1, and Rio Alto shall be responsible for any breach of this
Section 5.1 by any of its Representatives.

     5.2   | _Expenses and Termination Fee_ 

  



            | (a)   |   

"Termination Fee Event" means any of the following events: 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

            | (i)   |   

an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made public or proposed publicly to
Rio Alto or the Rio Alto Shareholders after the date hereof and prior to the
Rio Alto Meeting, and 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

            | (A)   |   

either Rio Alto or Tahoe shall have exercised its respective termination right
under Section 6.1(b)(i) or Section 6.1(b)(ii), and 

---|---|--- 
  
    
  

            | (B)   |   

Rio Alto shall have (x) completed any Acquisition Proposal within twelve
months after this Agreement is terminated or (y) entered into an Acquisition
Agreement in respect of any Acquisition Proposal or the Rio Alto Board shall
have recommended any Acquisition Proposal, in each case, within twelve months
after this Agreement is terminated, which Acquisition Proposal in either case,
as it may be modified or amended, is subsequently completed (whether before or
after the expiry of such twelve-month period); 

---|---|--- 
  

provided, however, that for the purposes of this Section 5.2(a)(i) all
references to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be changed
to "50%";

            | (ii)   |   

this Agreement shall have been terminated by Tahoe pursuant to Section
6.1(c)(i) or Section 6.1(c)(ii); or 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    
        | (iii)   |   

this Agreement shall have been terminated by Tahoe pursuant to Section
6.1(c)(iii) or Section 6.1(c)(vi) and Rio Alto shall have (x) completed any
Acquisition Proposal within twelve months after this Agreement is terminated
or (y) entered into an Acquisition Agreement in respect of any Acquisition
Proposal or the Rio Alto Board shall have recommended any Acquisition
Proposal, in each case, within twelve months after this Agreement is
terminated, which Acquisition Proposal in either case, as it may be modified
or amended, is subsequently completed (whether before or after the expiry of
such twelve month period); and 

        |    |    
        | (iv)   |   

this Agreement shall have been terminated by Rio Alto pursuant to Section
6.1(d)(i). 

  

(b) If a Termination Fee Event occurs, Rio Alto shall pay to Tahoe a
termination fee of $57.6 million (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account specified by Tahoe. Rio Alto shall
pay the Termination Fee to Tahoe on or prior to completion of the applicable
Acquisition Proposal (in the case of a Termination Fee Event referred to in
Section 5.2(a)(i) or 5.2(a)(iii), within one Business Day following
termination of this Agreement (in the case of a Termination Fee Event referred
to in Section 5.2(a)(ii)), or prior to or concurrent with termination of this
Agreement (in the case of a Termination Fee Event referred to in Section
5.2(a)(iv)). If Rio Alto does not have sufficient financial resources to pay
the Termination Fee, then it shall be a condition of (i) any Superior Proposal
referred to in Section 6.1(d)(i), and (ii) any share or asset acquisition
referred to in Section 5.2(a)(i)(B) or Section 5.2(a)(iii) where Rio Alto has
entered into any agreement to support such share acquisition or to transfer
such assets, as applicable, that the person making such Superior Proposal or
acquisition, as applicable, shall advance or otherwise provide to Rio Alto the
cash required for Rio Alto to pay the Termination Fee, which amount shall be
so advanced or provided prior to the date on which Rio Alto is required to pay
the Termination Fee. Tahoe acknowledges that in no event shall Rio Alto be
obligated to pay more than one Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 5.2.

  
    
  

  

(c) Except as otherwise specified herein, each Party will pay its respective
legal and accounting costs, fees and expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and all documents and
instruments executed pursuant to this Agreement and any other costs, fees and
expenses whatsoever and howsoever incurred, and will indemnify and save
harmless the others from and against any claim for any broker's, finder's or
placement fee or commission alleged to have been incurred as a result of any
action by it in connection with the transactions hereunder, except in the
event this Agreement is terminated in connection with a Termination Fee Event,
then Rio Alto shall promptly, but in no event later than the payment by Rio
Alto of the Termination Fee, pay the reasonable costs, fees and expenses
actually incurred by Tahoe in connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby to a maximum amount of
$2,500,000 as reimbursement to Tahoe payable by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account specified by Tahoe.

  

(d) Each Party acknowledges that all of the payment amounts set out in this
Section 5.2 are payments in consideration for the disposition of Tahoe's
rights under this Agreement and represent liquidated damages which are a
genuine pre-estimate of the damages which Tahoe will suffer or incur as a
result of the event giving rise to such payment and the resultant termination
of this Agreement and are not penalties. Rio Alto irrevocably waives any right
that it may have to raise as a defence that any such liquidated damages are
excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, the Parties agree that the
payment of an amount pursuant to this Section 5.2 in the manner provided
herein is the sole and exclusive remedy of Tahoe in respect of the event
giving rise to such payment, provided, however, that nothing contained in this
Section 5.2, and no payment of any such amount, shall relieve or have the
effect of relieving Rio Alto in any way from liability for damages incurred or
suffered by Tahoe as a result of an intentional or wilful breach of this
Agreement, including the intentional or wilful making of a misrepresentation
in this Agreement and nothing contained in this Section 5.2 shall preclude Rio
Alto from seeking injunctive relief in accordance with Section 8.13 to
restrain the breach or threatened breach of the covenants or agreements set
forth in this Agreement or the Confidentiality Agreement or otherwise to
obtain specific performance of any of such acts, covenants or agreements,
without the necessity of posting a bond or security in connection therewith.

not be available to any Party whose failure to fulfil any of its obligations
or breach of any of its representations and warranties under this Agreement
has 

---|---|--- 
  
    
  

  

been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time

recommendation of the Arrangement (it being understood that publicly taking no

        |    |    

        | (iii)    |   

subject to compliance with Section 6.3, Rio Alto breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement, which breach would cause any of the conditions set forth in 

  
    
  

  

Section 7.1 or Section 7.3 not to be satisfied, provided, however, that Tahoe
is not then in breach of this Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions
set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2 not to be satisfied;

            | (iv)   |   

a Rio Alto Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence, circumstance or

prior to the Rio Alto Meeting, subject to Rio Alto complying with the terms of
Section 5.1 and payment of the Termination Fee and provided that the Rio Alto
Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such definitive agreement constitutes
a Superior Proposal; or 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (ii)   |   

subject to compliance with Section 6.3, Tahoe breaches any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this

If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.1, this Agreement shall
become void and of no force and effect and no Party will have any liability or
further obligation to the other Party hereunder, except that the provisions of
this Section 6.2, Section 5.2 and Article 8 (other than Section 8.5 and
Section 8.8) shall survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 6.1,
provided, however, that neither the termination of this Agreement nor anything
contained in Section 5.2 or this Section 6.2 will relieve any Party from any
liability for any intentional or wilful breach by it of this Agreement,
including any intentional or wilful making of

  
    
  

  

a misrepresentation in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 6.1.

  

            | 
---|--- 
     6.3   | _Notice and Cure Provisions_ 

  

If any Party determines at any time prior to the Effective Time that it
intends to refuse to complete the transactions contemplated hereby because of
any unfilled or unperformed condition contained in this Agreement, such Party
will so notify the other Party forthwith upon making such determination in
order that the other Party will have the right and opportunity to take such
steps, at its own expense, as may be necessary for the purpose of fulfilling
or performing such condition within a reasonable period of time, but in no
event later than the Outside Date. Neither Rio Alto nor Tahoe may elect not to
complete the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to the conditions
precedent contained in Article 7 hereof or exercise any termination right
arising therefrom and no payments will be payable as a result of such election
pursuant to Article 7 unless forthwith and in any event prior to the Effective
Time the Party intending to rely thereon has given a written notice to the
other Party specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of covenants,
representations and warranties or other matters which the Party giving such
notice is asserting as the basis for the non-fulfillment of the applicable
condition precedent or the exercise of the termination right, as the case may
be. If any such notice is given, provided that the other Party is proceeding
diligently to cure such matter, if such matter is susceptible to being cured,
the Party giving such notice may not terminate this Agreement as a result
thereof until the earlier of the Outside Date and the expiration of a period
of 10 Business Days from such notice. If such notice has been given prior to
the date of the Rio Alto Meeting and the Tahoe Meeting, such meeting, unless
the Parties otherwise agree, will be postponed or adjourned until the expiry
of such period (without causing any breach of any other provision contained
herein).

the Consideration Shares to be issued pursuant to the Arrangement shall be
exempt from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act pursuant

prior to hearing in respect of the Interim Order that Tahoe intends to rely on
the exemption from registration afforded by Section 3(a)(10) of the U.S.
Securities Act based on the Court's approval of the Arrangement and comply
with the requirements set forth in Section 2.11 and the Final Order shall
reflect such reliance; and 

        |    |    

        | (g)    |   

this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

specified date, in which case such representations and warranties will have
been true and correct as of that date) and except (i) as affected by
transactions, changes, conditions, events or circumstances expressly permitted
by this Agreement or (ii) for breaches of representations and warranties which
individually or in the

Tahoe will have complied with its obligations under Section 2.10 and the

applicable therein. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably attorns to the non-
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of British Columbia in

---|--- 
     8.7   | **_Entire Agreement_** 

  

This Agreement constitutes, together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the

            | 
---|--- 
     8.8   | _Amendment_ 

  

(a) This Agreement may, at any time and from time to time before or after the
holding of the Rio Alto Meeting but not later than the Effective Time, be
amended by written agreement of the Parties without, subject to applicable
Laws, further notice to or authorization on the part of the Rio Alto
Shareholders, and any such amendment may, without limitation: 

            | (i)    |   

change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
Parties; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (ii)    |   

waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation, term or provision
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto; or 

        |    |    

        | (iii)    |   

waive compliance with or modify any of the conditions precedent referred to in
Article 7 or any of the covenants herein contained or waive or modify
performance of any of the obligations of the Parties, 

  

provided, however, that no such amendment may reduce or materially affect the
Consideration to be received by the Rio Alto Shareholders under the
Arrangement without their approval at the Rio Alto Meeting or, following the
Rio Alto Meeting, without their approval given in the same manner as required
by applicable Laws for the approval of the Arrangement as may be required by
the Court.

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan of Arrangement may only be
supplemented or amended in accordance with the provisions thereof.

  

            | 
---|--- 
     8.9   | _Waiver and Modifications_ 

  



  

Either Party may (a) waive, in whole or in part, any inaccuracy of, or consent
to the modification of, any representation or warranty made to it hereunder or
in any document to be delivered pursuant hereto, (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or acts of the other Party (c) waive or
consent to the modification of any of the covenants herein contained for its
benefit or waive or consent to the modification of any of the obligations of
the other Party hereto or (d) waive the fulfillment of any condition to its
own obligations contained herein. No waiver or consent to the modifications of
any of the provisions of this Agreement will be effective or binding unless
made in writing and signed by the Party or Parties purporting to give the same
and, unless otherwise provided, will be limited to the specific breach or

  
    
  

  

condition waived. The rights and remedies of the Parties hereunder are
cumulative and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights and remedies available at Law or in equity or otherwise. No single or
partial exercise by a Party of any right or remedy precludes or otherwise
affects any further exercise of such right or remedy or the exercise of any
other right or remedy to which that Party may be entitled. No waiver or
partial waiver of any nature, in any one or more instances, will be deemed or
construed a continued waiver of any condition or breach of any other term,
representation or warranty in this Agreement.

  

            | 
---|--- 
     8.10   | _Severability_ 

  



  

If any provision of this Agreement is determined by any court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal or unenforceable, that provision will be severed
from this Agreement and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated herein is not affected in any material manner or would prevent or
significantly impede or materially delay the completion of the Arrangement.

  



  

            | 
---|--- 
     8.11   | _Mutual Interest_ 

  



  

Notwithstanding the fact that any part of this Agreement has been drafted or
prepared by or on behalf of one of the Parties, the Parties confirm that they
and their respective counsel have reviewed and negotiated this Agreement and
that the Parties have adopted this Agreement as the joint agreement and
understanding of the Parties, and the language used in this Agreement will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent, and the Parties waive the application of any Laws or rule or
construction providing that ambiguities in any agreement or other document
will be construed against the Party drafting such agreement or other document
and agree that no rule of construction providing that a provision is to be
interpreted in favour of the person who contracted the obligation and against
the person who stipulated it will be applied against any Party.

  



  

            | 
---|--- 
     8.12   | _Further Assurances_ 

  



  

Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the Parties will, from time to
time, do all acts and things and execute and deliver all such further
documents and instruments, as the other Party may, either before or after the
Effective Date, reasonably require to effectively carry out or better evidence
or perfect the full intent and meaning of this Agreement and, in the event the
Arrangement becomes effective, to document or evidence any of the transactions
or events set out in the Plan of Arrangement.

  



  

            | 
---|--- 
     8.13   | _Injunctive Relief_ 

  



  

Subject to Section 5.2(d), the Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur
in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed
in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached for which
money damages would not be an adequate remedy at Law. It is accordingly agreed
that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions and other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement, any requirement for
the securing or posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any
such injunctive or other equitable relief hereby being waived.

---|--- 
     3.1   | The Arrangement 

  



  

Commencing at the Effective Time, each of the events set out below shall occur
and be deemed to occur in the following sequence, in each case without any
further authorization, act or formality of or by Rio Alto, Tahoe or any other
person:

  



            | (a)    |   

the rights issued under the Rio Alto Shareholder Rights Plan shall be
cancelled, without any payment or other consideration to the Rio Alto
Shareholders, and the Rio Alto Shareholder Rights Plan shall terminate and
cease to have any further force or effect; 

---|---|--- 
        |    |    

        | (b)    |   

Following the step in Section 3.1(a): 

            |    |    |    

---|---|---|--- 
        |    | (i)    |   

each Rio Alto Share held by a Dissenting Rio Alto Shareholder shall be deemed
to be transferred by the holder thereof, without any further act or formality
on its part, free and clear of all liens, claims and encumbrances, to Tahoe
and Tahoe shall thereupon be obliged to pay the amount therefor determined and
payable in accordance with Article 4 hereof, and the name of such holder shall
be removed from the central securities register of Rio Alto as a holder of Rio
Alto Shares and Tahoe shall be recorded as the registered holder of the Rio
Alto Shares so transferred and shall be deemed to be the legal owner of such
Rio Alto Shares; 

        |    |    |    

        |    | (ii)    |   

each issued Rio Alto Share held by a Former Rio Alto Shareholder (other than a
Dissenting Rio Alto Shareholder or Tahoe or any subsidiary of 

  
    
  

  

Tahoe) shall be transferred to Tahoe (free and clear of any Liens) and in
consideration therefor Tahoe shall issue Tahoe Shares on the basis of 0.227 of
a fully paid and non-assessable Tahoe Share and $0.001 in cash for each Rio
Alto Share, subject to Section 3.3 and Article 5 hereof;

            |    | (iii)    |   

at the same time as the steps in Sections 3.1(b)(i) and 3.1(b)(ii), with
respect to each Rio Alto Share, 

---|---|---|--- 
            |    |    |    |    

---|---|---|---|--- 
        |    |    | A.    |   

the holder thereof will cease to be the holder thereof or to have any rights
as a holder in respect of such Rio Alto Share and the name of the holder
thereof will be removed from the central securities register of Rio Alto with
respect to such Rio Alto Share; 

        |    |    |    |    

        |    |    | B.    |   

legal and beneficial title to such Rio Alto Share will vest in Tahoe and Tahoe
will be and be deemed to be the transferee and legal and beneficial owner of
such Rio Alto Share (free and clear of any Liens) and will be entered in the
central securities register of Rio Alto as the sole holder thereof; 

            |    |    |    

---|---|---|--- 
        |    | (iv)    |   

all Rio Alto Options shall vest and in accordance with the terms of the Rio
Alto Options, each outstanding Rio Alto Option shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder of a Rio Alto Option, be deemed to have been
exchanged for an option entitling the holder to receive, upon the due exercise
of such Rio Alto Option (including without limitation, payment of the exercise
price thereof), in lieu of Rio Alto Shares to which such holder was
theretofore entitled upon such exercise, the number of Tahoe Shares equal to
the product of: (A) the number of Rio Alto Shares subject to the Rio Alto
Option immediately before the Effective Time, and (B) 0.227 plus the portion
of a Tahoe Share that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, has a fair
market value equal to $0.001 cash, provided that if the foregoing would result
in the issuance of a fraction of a Tahoe Share on any particular exercise of a
Rio Alto Option, then the number of Tahoe Shares otherwise issued shall be
rounded down to the nearest whole number of Tahoe Shares. The exercise price
per Tahoe Share subject to any such Rio Alto Option shall be an amount equal
to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per Rio Alto Share subject to such
Rio Alto Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (B) 0.227
plus such portion of a Tahoe Share that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, has a fair market value equal to $0.001 cash (provided that the
aggregate exercise price payable on any particular exercise of Rio Alto
Options shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Subject to the
foregoing, each Rio Alto Option shall continue to be governed by and be
subject to the terms of the Rio Alto Option Plan, subject to any supplemental
exercise documents issued by Tahoe to holders of Rio Alto Options to
facilitate the exercise of the Rio Alto Option and the payment of the
corresponding portion of the exercise price with each of them. Each Rio Alto
Option will remain exercisable for a period of one year from the date on which
the 

        |    |    |   


 
  
    
  

  

holder of such options with Rio Alto is terminated in connection with the
Arrangement, being the exercise period provided for in the Rio Alto Option
Plan;

  

If the adjustment to the Rio Alto Options contemplated by this paragraph
results in a disposition of Rio Alto Options for options to acquire Tahoe
Shares or "new" Rio Alto Options, it is intended that the provisions of
subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act apply to any such disposition. Therefore, in
the event that the Tahoe Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of a Rio Alto
Option exceeds Rio Alto Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the Rio Alto
Option, the number of Tahoe Shares which may be acquired on exercise of the
Rio Alto Option at and after the Effective Time will be adjusted accordingly
with effect at and from the Effective Time to ensure that the Tahoe Option In-
The-Money Amount in respect of the Rio Alto Option does not exceed Rio Alto
Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the Rio Alto Option and the ratio of
the amount payable to acquire such shares to the value of such shares to be
acquired shall be unchanged;

            |    | (v)    |   

in accordance with the terms of the SGC Options, each outstanding SGC Option
shall, without any further action on the part of any holder of an SGC Option,
be deemed to have been exchanged for an option entitling the holder to
receive, upon the due exercise of such SGC Option (including without
limitation, payment of the exercise price thereof), in lieu of Rio Alto Shares
to which such holder was theretofore entitled upon such exercise, the number
of Tahoe Shares equal to the product of: (A) the number of Rio Alto Shares
subject to the SGC Option immediately before the Effective Time, and (B) 0.227
plus the portion of a Tahoe Share that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, has a fair market value equal to $0.001 cash, provided that if the
foregoing would result in the issuance of a fraction of a Tahoe Share on any
particular exercise of a SGC Option, then the number of Tahoe Shares otherwise
issued shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number of Tahoe Shares. The
exercise price per Tahoe Share subject to any such SGC Option shall be an
amount equal to the quotient of (A) the exercise price per Rio Alto Share
subject to such SGC Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by
(B) 0.227 plus such portion of a Tahoe Share that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, has a fair market value equal to $0.001 cash (provided that
the aggregate exercise price payable on any particular exercise of SGC Options
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole cent). Subject to the foregoing, each
SGC Option shall continue to be governed by and be subject to the terms of the
SGC Option Plan, subject to any supplemental exercise documents issued by
Tahoe to holders of SGC Options to facilitate the exercise of the SGC Option
and the payment of the corresponding portion of the exercise price with each
of them. 

---|---|---|--- 
  
    
  

  

If the adjustment to the SGC Options contemplated by this paragraph results in
a disposition of SGC Options for options to acquire Tahoe Shares or "new" SGC
Options, it is intended that the provisions of subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax
Act apply to any such disposition. Therefore, in the event that the Tahoe
Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of a SGC Option exceeds SGC Option In-
The-Money Amount in respect of the SGC Option, the number of Tahoe Shares
which may be acquired on exercise of the SGC Option at and after the Effective
Time will be adjusted accordingly with effect at and from the Effective Time
to ensure that the Tahoe Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the SGC
Option does not exceed SGC Option In-The-Money Amount in respect of the SGC
Option and the ratio of the amount payable to acquire such shares to the value
of such shares to be acquired shall be unchanged; and

            |    | (vi)    |   

each holder of each Rio Alto Option, SGC Option and Rio Alto Share, with
respect to each step set out above applicable to such holder, shall be deemed,
at the time such step occurs, to have executed and delivered all consents,
releases, assignments and waivers, statutory or otherwise, required to
transfer such Rio Alto Option, SGC Option and Rio Alto Share, as the case may
be, in accordance with such step; 

---|---|---|--- 
        |    |    |    

        |    | (vii)    |   

each Rio Alto Share held by Tahoe shall be transferred to Subco in
consideration of the issue by Subco to Tahoe of one common share of Subco for
each Rio Alto Share so transferred, and the amount added to the stated capital
of the Subco common shares will be equal to the paid up capital (as such term
is defined in the Tax Act) of the Rio Alto Shares so transferred; 

        |    |    |    

        |    | (viii)    |   

the stated capital in respect of the Rio Alto Shares shall be reduced to $1.00
without any repayment of capital in respect thereof; 

        |    |    |    

        |    | (ix)    |   

Rio Alto will file an election with the CRA to cease to be a public
corporation for the purposes of the Tax Act; 

        |    |    |    

        |    | (x)    |   

Rio Alto and Subco shall amalgamate to continue as one corporation ("Amalco")
under Section 184(1) of the ABCA; 

        |    |    |    

        |    | (xi)    |   

from and after the Effective Date: 

            |    |    |    |    

---|---|---|---|--- 
        |    |    | A.    |   

Amalco will continue to be liable for all of the liabilities and obligations
of Rio Alto and Subco; 

        |    |    |    |

all rights, contracts, permits and interests of Rio Alto and Subco will
continue as rights, contracts, permits and interests of Amalco as if Rio Alto
and Subco continued and, for greater certainty, the amalgamation will not
constitute a transfer or assignment of the rights or obligations of either of
Rio Alto or Subco under any such rights, contacts, permits and interests; 

  
    
  

            |    |    | C.    |   

any existing cause of action, claim or liability prosecution will be
unaffected; 

---|---|---|---|--- 
        |    |    |    |    

        |    |    | D.    |   

a civil, criminal or administrative action or proceeding pending by or against
either Subco or Rio Alto may be continued by or against Amalco; 

        |    |    |    |    

        |    |    | E.    |

either Rio Alto or Subco may be enforced by or against Amalco; 

        |    |    |    |    

        |    |    | F.    |   

the name of Amalco shall be "Rio Alto Mining Limited";

     3.2   | Post Effective Time Procedures 

  



  

(a) Following the receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Date,
Tahoe shall deliver or arrange to be delivered to the Depositary the
Consideration, including certificates representing the Tahoe Shares required
to be issued to Former Rio Alto Shareholders and the requisite cash required
to be paid to Former Rio Alto Shareholders, each in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.1(b) hereof, which certificates and cash shall be held
by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such Former Rio Alto Shareholders
for distribution to such Former Rio Alto Shareholders in accordance with the
provisions of Article 5 hereof.

  

(b) Subject to the provisions of Article 5 hereof, and upon return of a
properly completed Rio Alto Letter of Transmittal by a registered Former Rio
Alto Shareholder together with certificates representing Rio Alto Shares and
such other documents as the Depositary may require, Former Rio Alto
Shareholders shall be entitled to receive delivery of the certificates
representing the Tahoe Shares and a cheque representing the net cash payment
to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(b) hereof.

  
    
  

  

(c) An Eligible Holder whose Rio Alto Shares are exchanged for the
Consideration pursuant to the Arrangement shall be entitled to make a joint
income tax election, pursuant to Section 85 of the Tax Act (and any analogous
provision of provincial income tax Law) (a "Section 85 Election"), with
respect to the exchange by providing the tax election information contained in
the tax instruction letter to be provided by Tahoe, including the number of
Rio Alto shares transferred, the transferred properties' cost base, the
applicable agreed amounts for the purposes of such election and other
information necessary to complete the Section 85 Election (the "Section 85
Election Information"), to an appointed representative, as directed by Tahoe,
within 60 days after the Effective Date (the "Tax Election Deadline"). Tahoe
shall, within 60 days after the Tax Election Deadline, and subject to the
Eligible Holder furnishing Section 85 Election Information that is correct and
complete and in compliance with requirements imposed under the Tax Act (or
applicable provincial income tax Law), complete, sign and deliver the Section
85 Election to the Former Rio Alto Shareholder for filing with the CRA (or the
applicable provincial tax authority). Each Eligible Holder shall be solely
responsible for ensuring the Section 85 Election is completed correctly and
filed with the CRA (and any applicable provincial income tax authority) by the
filing deadline. Except for the obligation to complete, sign and deliver
Section 85 Election forms for which complete and accurate Section 85 Election
Information is received on or before the Tax Election Deadline, neither Rio
Alto, Tahoe nor any successor corporation shall be responsible for any taxes,
interest or penalties resulting from the failure of an Eligible Holder to
properly or timely submit Section 85 Election Information or file any Section
85 Election forms in the form and manner and within the time prescribed by the
Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation). In its sole discretion,
Tahoe or any successor corporation may choose to make a Section 85 Election
with an Eligible Holder from whom it receives Section 85 Election Information
after the Tax Election Deadline, but will have no obligation to do so.

Holder has indicated that the Eligible Holder intends to make a Section 85
Election, Tahoe will promptly deliver a tax instruction letter to the Eligible
Holder. A tax instruction letter may also be obtained on Tahoe's website at

     3.3   | No Fractional Tahoe Shares 

  



  

In no event shall any holder of Rio Alto Shares be entitled to a fractional
Tahoe Share. Where the aggregate number of Tahoe Shares to be issued to a Rio
Alto Shareholder as consideration under or as a result of this Arrangement
would result in a fraction of a Tahoe Share being issuable, the number of
Tahoe Shares to be received by such Securityholder shall be rounded down to
the nearest whole number of Tahoe Shares (with fractions equal to exactly 0.5
being rounded up) and no former Rio Alto Shareholder will be entitled to any
compensation in respect of a fractional Tahoe Share.

  



  

            | 
---|--- 
     3.4   | No Fractional Cash Consideration 

  



  

Any cash consideration owing to a Former Rio Alto Shareholder shall be rounded

The Arrangement is intended to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning
of Sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the Code and this Plan of

Article 4 
_WARRANTS_

  

            | 
---|--- 
     4.1   | Rio Alto Warrants 

  



  

In accordance with the terms of the Rio Alto Warrants, each holder of a Rio
Alto Warrant shall be entitled to receive (and such holder shall accept) upon
the exercise of such holder\'s Rio Alto Warrant, in lieu of Rio Alto Shares to
which such holder was theretofore entitled upon such exercise, and for the
same aggregate consideration payable therefor, the number of Tahoe Shares and
cash which the holder would have been entitled to receive as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Arrangement if, immediately prior to the
Effective Date, such holder had been the registered holder of the number of
Rio Alto Shares to which such holder would have been entitled if such holder
had exercised such holder\'s Rio Alto Warrants immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each Rio Alto Warrant shall continue to be governed by and be
subject to the terms of the applicable Rio Alto Warrant certificate, subject
to any supplemental exercise documents issued by Tahoe to holders of Rio Alto
Warrants to facilitate the exercise of the Warrants and the payment of the
corresponding portion of the exercise price with each them.

  

Article 5 
_DISSENT RIGHTS_

  

            | 
---|--- 
     5.1   | Rights of Dissent 

  



  

Pursuant to the Interim Order, each registered Rio Alto Shareholder may
exercise rights of dissent ("Dissent Rights") under Section 191 of the ABCA as
modified by this Article 6 as the same may be modified by the Interim Order or
the Final Order in respect of the Arrangement, provided that the written
objection to the Arrangement Resolution contemplated by Section 191 of the
ABCA must be sent to and received by Rio Alto at or before the Rio Alto
Meeting or any date to which the Rio Alto Meeting may be postponed or
adjourned. Rio Alto Shareholders who duly exercise such rights of dissent and
who:

  

(a) are ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value from Tahoe,
for the Dissenting Shares in respect of which they have exercised Dissent
Rights, will be deemed to have irrevocably transferred such Dissenting Shares
to Tahoe pursuant to Section 3.1(b)(i) in consideration of such fair value; or

  

(b) are ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid fair value for the
Dissenting Shares in respect of which they have exercised Dissent Rights, will
be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement on the same basis as a Rio
Alto Shareholder who has not

  
    
  

  

exercised Dissent Rights, as at and from the time specified in Section
3.1(b)(i), and be entitled to receive only the consideration set forth in
Section 3.1(b)(ii);

  

but in no case will Rio Alto or Tahoe or any other person be required to
recognize such holders as holders of Rio Alto Shares after the completion of
the steps set forth in Section 3.1(b), and each Dissenting Rio Alto
Shareholder will cease to be entitled to the rights of a Rio Alto Shareholder
in respect of the Rio Alto Shares in relation to which such Dissenting Rio
Alto Shareholder has exercised Dissent Rights and the central securities
register of Rio Alto will be amended to reflect that such former holder is no
longer the holder of such Rio Alto Shares as and from the completion of the
steps in Section 3.1(b).

claim that may be made against Rio Alto or Tahoe with respect to the
certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.
