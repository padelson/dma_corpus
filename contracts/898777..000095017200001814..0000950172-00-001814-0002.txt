section of The Wall Street Journal plus (2) 100 basis points (the "Interest
Rate"), such interest to be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days

a statement setting forth the Net Assets as of the Cut-Off Date (the "Cut-Off
Date Net Assets Statement") and (B) a report setting forth the Net Book Value
of Equipment as of the Cut-Off Date (the "Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of
Equipment Report," and, together with the Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement,
referred to as the "Cut-Off Date Statements"). The Cut-Off Date Statements
will be in conformity with Seller\'s historical accounting practices and will
present fairly in conformity therewith the respective information set forth
therein. The Cut-Off Date Statements will be prepared on the same basis as
and in a manner consistent with the Signing Net Asset Statement and the
Signing Net Book Value Report. The methodology and principles used in the
preparation of the Signing Net Assets Statement shall govern the preparation
of the Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement and the methodology and principles
used in the preparation of the Signing Net Book Value of Equipment Report
shall govern the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of
Equipment Report. During the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Statements,
Seller shall provide Purchaser and its representatives reasonable access to
the information and related documentation used in the preparation of
the Cut-Off Date Statements and will permit Purchaser and its
representatives to meet with and ask questions of the individuals preparing
the Cut-Off Date Statements and, if a physical inventory is taken as part of
such preparation, to observe such taking of physical inventory.  (ii) After
the Closing, Purchaser and its independent certified public accountants shall
have the right to audit commencing as of the Closing and continuing until 30
days following the Closing, at Purchaser\'s expense, the information
presented in the Cut-Off Date Statements and to examine and review all
records and work papers and other supporting documents used to prepare the
Cut-Off Date Statements. Purchaser shall notify Seller in writing, on or
before the 30th day following Closing, of (A) any objections it has to the
Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement, setting forth a reasonably detailed
explanation of Purchaser\'s objections and the dollar amount of each such
objection and (B) any objections it has to the Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of
Equipment Report, setting forth a reasonably detailed explanation of
Purchaser\'s objections and the dollar amount of each such objection. If
Purchaser does not deliver such notice on or before the 30th day following
Closing, the Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement and the Cut-Off Date Net Book
Value of Equipment Report, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have been
irrevocably accepted by Purchaser.  (iii) If Purchaser in good faith objects
to the information set forth on the Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement or the
information set forth on the Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of Equipment Report,
Seller and Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to resolve any such
objections within 30 days of Seller\'s receipt of Purchaser\'s objections. If
Seller and Purchaser are unable to resolve the matter within such 30-day
period, they shall jointly appoint an impartial nationally recognized
independent certified public accounting firm (the "Impartial Accounting
Firm") mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (or, if they cannot agree
on a mutually acceptable firm, they shall cause their respective accounting
firms to select such firm) within five days of the end of such 30-day period
to resolve any such remaining matters. Any such resolution shall be made
applying the methodologies and principles used in the preparation of the
Signing Net Assets Statement or the Signing Net Book Value of Equipment
Report, as the case may be, and shall be final, conclusive and binding on
Purchaser and Seller. The fees of the Impartial Accounting Firm shall be
borne equally by Purchaser on the one hand and Seller on the other hand.
Seller and Purchaser shall fully cooperate with the Impartial Accounting
Firm. The Impartial Accounting Firm shall be requested to reach its
written conclusion regarding the dispute within 30 days of its appointment
to settle the dispute. The Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement after
the acceptance thereof by Purchaser pursuant to the last sentence of
Section 2.6(a)(ii) or the resolution of all disputes in connection therewith
in accordance with this Section 2.6(a)(iii) is referred to herein as the
"Net Assets Statement." The Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of Equipment
Report after the acceptance thereof by Purchaser pursuant to the last
sentence of Section 2.6(a)(ii) or the resolution of all disputes in
connection therewith in accordance with this Section 2.6(a)(iii) is referred
to herein as the "Net Book Value of Equipment Report."  (b) Payments. (i)
If the Net Book Value of Equipment as reflected on the Net Book Value of
Equipment Report is greater than the Net Book Value of Equipment as reflected
on the Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of Equipment Report, then the Purchase
Price shall be increased by the amount of such excess (the amount of such
Purchase Price increase shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Additional
Equipment Payment Amount"). If the Net Book Value of Equipment as reflected
on the Net Book Value of Equipment Report is less than the Net Book Value of
Equipment as reflected on the Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of Equipment
Report, then the Purchase Price shall be decreased by such excess (the amount
of such Purchase Price reduction shall be hereinafter referred to as the
"Equipment Refund Amount"). If the Net Book Value of Equipment as reflected
on the Net Book Value of Equipment Report equals the Net Book Value of
Equipment as reflected on the Cut-Off Date Net Book Value of Equipment
Report, then the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.6(b)(i).  (ii) If the Net Assets as reflected on the Net Assets
Statement is greater than the Net Assets as reflected on the Cut-Off Date Net
Assets Statement, then the Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount of
such excess (the amount of such Purchase Price increase shall be hereinafter
referred to as the "Additional Net Assets Payment Amount"). If the Net Assets
as reflected on the Net Assets Statement is less than the Net Assets
as reflected on the Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement, then the Purchase
Price shall be decreased by such excess (the amount of such Purchase
Price reduction shall be hereinafter referred to as the "Net Assets
Refund Amount"). If the Net Assets as reflected on the Net Assets Statement
equals the Net Assets as reflected on the Cut-Off Date Net Asset Statement,
then the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted pursuant to this
Section 2.6(b)(ii).   (c) The Equipment Refund Amount (if any) and the
Net Assets Refund Amount (if any) shall be paid by Seller to Purchaser by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by Purchaser. The Additional Equipment Payment Amount (if any) and
the Additional Net Assets Payment Amount (if any) shall be paid by Purchaser
to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Seller. The Equipment Refund Amount, the Net Assets
Refund Amount, the Additional Equipment Payment Amount, and the Additional
Net Assets Payment Amount, as the case may be, shall be increased by
interest on such amount from the Cut-Off Date to the payment date at the
Interest Rate. Any payments required pursuant to this Section 2.6(c) shall be
made within five days after the later of the date the Net Assets
Statement becomes final and binding on the parties hereto or the date the Net
Book Value of Equipment Report becomes final and binding on the parties
hereto, as the case may be.  2.7 Cash Management after the Cut-Off Date.
(a) Purchaser and Seller agree that following the Cut-Off Date the Business
will be operated for the account of Purchaser, with the intention that all
revenues, expenses, cash flows and profits of the Business shall be for the
account of Purchaser and that the following provisions of this Section 2.7
are intended to give effect to the foregoing principle. The Cash Management
Schedule shall be prepared in a manner which is designed to avoid any

excluding any payments of Excluded Liabilities (or liabilities which would be

Seller hereunder) shall be payable in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and shall be treated as a payable to Seller
from the Business; (B) any goods or services provided by Seller or any
other Affiliate of Parent for the benefit of the Business shall be treated as
a payable to Seller from the Business and the amounts which are so
treated (including, without limitation, all charges for corporate shared
services, allocations and amortization/depreciation of shared systems and
software) which are incurred or reported in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice shall be in accordance with the
prior practice for intercompany transactions between Seller or any
other Affiliate of Parent and the Business; and (C) all receipts of the
Business after the Cut-Off Date (including without limitation, in respect of
the operation of the Business and sales Domestic Containers, Trailers
and/or Chassis) which are transferred to Seller or any other Affiliate of

amounts which are so treated shall be in accordance with the prior practice
for intercompany transactions between Seller or any other Affiliate of
Parent and the Business.  (ii) The net balance as of the Closing Date due
to Seller or the Business, as the case may be, in respect of the aggregate
amounts described in clauses (A) through (C), as reflected in a schedule of
such amounts (the "Cash Management Schedule"), which shall be prepared and
delivered to Purchaser as promptly as practicable, but in no event more than
30 days after the Closing Date, shall be paid by Purchaser (if a net balance
is due to Seller) or Seller (if a net balance is due to the Business), to
Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, within five Business Days
following delivery of the Cash Management Schedule to Purchaser together
with interest thereon at an annual rate equal to the Interest Rate,
such interest to be calculated on the basis of a year of 365 days,
calculated with respect to each separate item included in the calculation of
such net balance from the date such item accrued or arose to the date
immediately preceding the date of payment.  (c) Disagreements with Respect
to Cash Management Schedule. (i) Seller shall provide Purchaser and its
counsel, accountants and other advisors full access to books, records and
personnel of the Business as reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to
understand and verify the accuracy of the Cash Management Schedule. During
the preparation of the Cash Management Schedule, Seller will provide to
Purchaser access to the information and related documentation used in the
preparation of the Cash Management Schedule. During the 30 days following
delivery by Seller of the Cash Management Schedule, Purchaser shall be free
to dispute any item reflected in the Cash Management Schedule. At the end of
the 30-day period provided by this Section 2.7(c)(i), Purchaser and Seller
shall jointly prepare a report listing the matters in dispute by item (the
"Disputed Cash Management Items"). Promptly following the conclusion of such
30-day period and completion of the report referred to in the preceding
sentence, Seller shall pay to Purchaser or Purchaser shall pay to Seller, as
applicable, the amount of the adjustments to be made pursuant to this Section
2.7(c) which have been resolved during such period.  (ii) If after the
30-day period provided in Section 2.7(c)(i) there shall be Disputed Cash
Management Items, Purchaser shall, within 30 days following delivery of the
report contemplated by Section 2.7(c)(i) with respect to Disputed Cash
Management Items, deliver a notice to Seller setting forth in reasonable
detail Purchaser\'s disagreement with the Cash Management Schedule.  (iii)
If a notice of disagreement shall be delivered pursuant to
Section 2.7(c)(ii), the parties shall, during the 30 days following delivery
of the notice that sets forth Purchaser\'s disagreement, use reasonable
efforts to reach agreement on the Disputed Cash Management Items. If, during
such period, the parties are unable to reach such agreement, then they
shall promptly thereafter jointly appoint an Impartial Accounting Firm
mutually acceptable to Purchaser and Seller (or, if they cannot agree on a
mutually acceptable firm, they shall cause their respective accounting firms
to select such firm) within five days of the end of such 30-day period
to resolve any such remaining matters. Any such resolution shall be
made applying the methodologies and principles used in the preparation of
the Signing Net Assets Statement or the Signing Net Book Value of
Equipment Report, as the case may be, and shall be final, conclusive and
binding on Purchaser and Seller. The fees of the Impartial Accounting Firm
shall be borne equally by Purchaser on the one hand and Seller on the other
hand. Seller and Purchaser shall fully cooperate with the Impartial
Accounting Firm. The Impartial Accounting Firm shall be requested to reach
its written conclusion regarding the dispute within 30 days of its
appointment to settle the dispute.  (iv) Any payment resulting from the
adjustment to be made pursuant to this Section 2.7(c) shall be paid by wire
transfer of immediately available funds in New York City which are
denominated in U.S. dollars, to such account or accounts as Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, shall designate in writing to the other party
hereto at least two Business Days prior to the time such payment is required

them, or the single-employer plan of an entity which is considered one
employer with the Seller under Section 4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the

its Subsidiaries nor an ERISA Affiliate has contributed to a "multiemployer
plan", within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, at any time in the six
years prior to the date hereof, for which Purchaser could reasonably be
expected to have any Liability following the Closing Date.  (e) Except as

Disclosure Schedule, no material audit or other administrative proceedings or
court proceedings are presently pending or proposed in writing with regard to
any Taxes or Tax Returns of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to

present or future right or option to acquire any ownership interest in any
equipment under an Equipment Lease that is a Material Contract or to retain
any such equipment without paying a reasonable rental therefore after the
expiration of the term of such lease, other than ordinary course hold-over
provisions. The defaults by the lessees under the Equipment Leases do not in
the aggregate have a Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Seller,
there are no oral Material Contracts or oral modifications to any
Material Contracts.  (f) Under the terms of the Canada Trust Transaction
Documents, Seller is entitled to receive and retain all sublease rental
payments received by Seller from subleasing the assets that are subject to

the right to receive and retain such sublease rental payments.   The "Non-

or its representatives shall be subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, and such information shall be held by Purchaser
and its representatives in accordance with the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, provided, however, that following the Closing,
this Section 6.2 and the Confidentiality Agreement shall not prohibit
Purchaser from using and providing to third parties such information
concerning the Assets or the Business (but not any other assets, liabilities
or other information relating to Seller) as it may deem appropriate. From the
date hereof through the Closing, Seller will continue to prepare and to
promptly provide to Purchaser such management reports and information and
financial statements and information as Seller currently prepares in the
ordinary course of business.  6.3 Taking of Necessary Action. (a) Each of
the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
or cause to be taken all action and promptly do or cause to be done all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated hereby.  (b) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
(i) as soon as practicable after the date hereof, file such applications,
notices, registrations and requests as may be required or advisable to be
filed by it with any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) furnish the other party with copies of
all documents and correspondence (A) prepared by or on behalf of such party
for submission to any Governmental Authority and (B) received by or on behalf
of such party from any Governmental Authority, in each case in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) consult with and keep the
other party informed as to the status of such matters. To the extent that
any application, notice, registration or request so filed contains
any significant information relating to the other party or any of
its Affiliates, prior to submitting such application, notice, registration
or request to any Governmental Authority, each party will permit the
other party to review such information and will consider in good faith
the suggestions of the other party with respect thereto. Each party shall
have the right to approve any such information that relates to it, and
its Affiliates, or, in the case of Seller, the Business or the Assets
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld).  (c) Each party shall
cooperate with the other party in the preparation and filing of any
applications, notices, registrations and responses to requests for additional
information from Governmental Authorities made by the other party with any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby, including providing such information as the other party may
reasonably request for inclusion in such applications, notices, registrations
and responses.  (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
6.3, (i) neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall
be required to divest a material portion of any of (X) the Trailers, (Y)
the Domestic Containers or (Z) the Chassis or a material portion of any of
(A) the trailers, (B) the domestic containers or (C) the chassis of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) neither Purchaser nor any of its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries shall be required to take or agree to take any
other action or agree to any limitation that could reasonably be expected to
be material to the business, assets, condition (financial or otherwise),
results of operations or prospects of Purchaser and its Affiliates or
Subsidiaries taken as a whole or to the Business taken as a whole.  6.4
Release of Seller from Assumed Liabilities. In addition to assuming
the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with Section 2.3, Purchaser agrees to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Seller or any Affiliate
of Seller to be absolutely and unconditionally released on or prior to
the Closing Date from each Assumed Liability. In addition to assuming
the Assumed Liabilities in accordance with Section 2.3, Purchaser agrees
to continue to use its best efforts after the Closing Date to relieve
Seller and such Affiliates of any Assumed Liabilities that are not released
or otherwise discharged prior to the Closing Date.  6.5 Exclusivity.
Recognizing that Purchaser\'s investigations of Seller and the Business, and
the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement and the other agreements,
documents and instruments to be executed by Purchaser in connection herewith
have to date required and will continue to require Purchaser to expend
significant time, effort and money, and to induce Purchaser to execute and
deliver this Agreement and proceed with the transaction contemplated hereby,
Seller agrees that, as long as Purchaser is not in material breach of its
obligations under this Agreement (which breach, if curable, has not been
cured within five Business Days of notice), none of Seller, Parent, any of
their Subsidiaries or any of their directors, officers, representatives,
financial advisors, or agents will, directly or indirectly, encourage any
offers from, solicit, encourage, initiate, respond to (other than by a bare
statement, without further detail or explanation, that they are not permitted
to respond) or continue any discussions with, engage in discussions or
negotiations with or provide any information to, or enter into any agreements
or understandings with, any Person, other than Purchaser and its officers,
employees, advisors and agents, concerning any sale or other transfer of the
Business or Assets, or any material portion of the Business or Assets.  6.6
Release of Purchaser from Excluded Liabilities. Purchaser shall not assume
any Excluded Liability and Seller shall retain all liability for paying,
satisfying and performing all Excluded Liabilities.  6.7 Insurance; Risk of
Loss. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date (i) Seller will terminate or cause
its Subsidiaries to terminate all coverage relating to the Business, the
Assets and current or former Business Employees under the general corporate
policies of insurance, cancelable surety bonds and hold harmless agreements
of Seller for the benefit of all of its controlled subsidiaries and (ii) from
and after the Closing Date Purchaser shall become solely responsible for all
insurance coverage and related risk of loss with respect to the Business,
Assets and current or former Business Employees for events occurring,
circumstances existing and Liabilities accruing on or after the
Closing.  (b) Notwithstanding clause (a), to the extent that (i) any
insurance policies (other than Seller\'s insolvency insurance policy referred
to in Section 2.2(g)) controlled by Seller and its Subsidiaries
("Seller\'s Insurance Policies") cover any Liability, loss, damage or expense
relating to any of the Business, the Assets and current or former Business
Employees ("Business Liabilities") and arising out of occurrences, events
or circumstances prior to the Closing Date and (ii) Seller\'s
Insurance Policies continue after the Closing to permit claims to be made
thereunder with respect to Business Liabilities arising out of occurrences,
events or circumstances prior to the Closing Date ("Business Claims"), Seller
shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser in submitting Business Claims
(or pursuing Business Claims previously made) on behalf of Purchaser
under Seller\'s Insurance Policies; provided, that Seller shall be under
no obligation to commence or maintain litigation to enforce any Business
Claim (except to the extent that Purchaser agrees to hold Seller harmless
under terms reasonably acceptable to Seller in connection therewith).  6.8
Assumption of Proceedings. From and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
assume the defense of and indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates
harmless from and against any and all actions, suits, claims
and administrative or other proceedings of every kind and nature instituted
or commenced against Seller or any of its Affiliates at any time after
the Closing Date that constitutes an Assumed Liability. Purchaser shall
have the right to assume and conduct the defense of any such matters, and
Seller and its Subsidiaries shall cooperate in such defense to the
extent reasonably requested by Purchaser.  6.9 Mail; Payments. Seller
hereby authorizes Purchaser after the Closing to receive and open all mail
and other communications received by the Business, and to act with respect to
such communications in such manner as Purchaser may elect if such
communications primarily relate to the Business or any of the Assets, or, if
such communications do not so primarily relate, to forward the same promptly
to Seller. After the Closing, Purchaser shall have the right and authority to
endorse, without recourse, the name of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries on
any check or any other evidence of indebtedness received by Purchaser on
account of any of the Assets or the Business. Any payment received by Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing to the extent relating to the
Assets or Business shall be promptly remitted to Purchaser and any payment
received by Purchaser to the extent in respect of Excluded Assets or
Excluded Liabilities shall be promptly remitted to Seller. Seller or a
Subsidiary thereof shall promptly deliver to Purchaser the original of any
mail or other communication received by it after the Closing primarily
relating to the Assets or Excluded Liabilities or the Business and any
moneys, checks or other instruments of payment to which Purchaser is
entitled.  6.10 License of Name. (a) Seller hereby grants to Purchaser a
fully-paid, royalty-free and non-exclusive license to use the Names and
the corresponding trademarks (including other common law or statutory
trademark rights therein and derivations or stylizations thereof,
"Trademarks") and the Prefixes, in connection with and as a part of the
Business (the "License") for the relevant period of time from and after the
Closing Date as set forth in the following sentence (the "License Term") and
subject to the following provisions of this Section 6.9. The License granted
to Purchaser hereunder authorizes Purchaser to continue to use the Names,
any corresponding Trademark and the Prefixes that appear on a Trailer,
Domestic Container or Chassis as of the Closing Date, on such Trailer,
Domestic Container or Chassis for the life of such Trailer, Domestic
Container or Chassis without obligation to remove, cover or otherwise obscure
the appearance of the Name, Trademark or Prefix thereon; provided, that if
any Trailer, Domestic Container or Chassis is refurbished or repainted
or ceases, directly or indirectly, to be both owned and operated by
Purchaser, then in each case the License with respect to such Trailer,
Domestic Container or Chassis shall terminate and Purchaser shall promptly
remove any Name, Trademark or Prefix thereon. In no event may Purchaser use
the Names or any corresponding Trademark on any Trailer, Domestic Container
or Chassis not acquired hereunder. At the expiration of the License Term,
all such use of the Names, any corresponding Trademarks and the Prefixes
by Purchaser shall cease.  (b) (i) As used herein, "Names" means the terms
"Transamerica," "Transamerica Leasing," "Trans Ocean," "Realco," "ICS" and
such other names that correspond to the Prefixes.  (ii) "Prefix" shall mean
all of the alphabetical prefixes imprinted on, and used by Seller to
identify, the Trailers, Domestic Containers or Chassis, which shall include

"NCRU," "REAU," "REAZ," "RMPZ," "RTMZ," "RXXZ," "SMTZ," "TCPU," "TCPZ,"
"TDNZ," "TGPZ," "TMEZ," "TRLU," "TRZZ," "TSPZ," "TSSZ," "TSXZ" and
"UTHZ."  (c) Purchaser hereby waives and disclaims any right or interest in
or to ownership of the Names or any Trademarks that may arise under
any Applicable Law out of the use hereunder of the Names or any such
Trademarks and acknowledges that its right to use the Names, Trademarks and
Prefixes is solely to the extent provided in subsection (a) above. No right
to assign, transfer or sublicense the Names or any corresponding Trademark
is included herein, and such rights to use the Names or any
corresponding Trademark are expressly withheld, except that Purchaser may
assign or otherwise transfer its rights to use the Names or any
corresponding Trademark hereunder to its Subsidiaries or by operation of law
in a merger (subject to the provisions of this Section 6.10); provided that
in the event that such Subsidiary ceases to be a Subsidiary, the rights
hereunder assigned or otherwise transferred shall terminate. Purchaser may
not assign, sublicense or otherwise transfer, directly or indirectly,
the License (or any portion thereof) granted hereunder except by operation
of law in a merger (subject to the provisions of this Section 6.10).  (d)
Purchaser shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing
Date, make application for and effect a change in all of the registrations
and licenses with respect to the Trailers and Chassis from Seller or an
Affiliate thereof to Purchaser. Any registration fees or charges associated
with the registration and licensing of Purchaser as owner of the Trailers,
Domestic Containers and Chassis shall be paid by Purchaser and any refunds of
such registration fees already paid by or on behalf of Seller or an Affiliate
thereof shall be for Purchaser\'s account and, if paid to Seller or an
Affiliate thereof, shall promptly be paid over by Seller to Purchaser.  (e)
After the Closing, Purchaser shall not use any forms (including forms of
agreement), stationery, brochures or other similar items (the "Supplies")
that bear any Names or Prefixes or any current logos of Parent or any of its
Affiliates, provided that Purchaser may continue to use business forms
included within the Supplies, provided, further, that Purchaser shall cease
using such business forms as promptly as practicable, but in no event later
than 60 days after the Closing.  6.11 Post-Closing Sales Tax Cooperation.
Seller agrees that following the Closing, Purchaser shall have reasonable
access during normal business hours to the books and records of Seller as
they relate to the sales taxes paid by the Business during the period prior
to Closing; provided that such access shall not interfere with the normal
operations of the Seller\'s business.  6.12 Post-Closing Accounting
Cooperation. Purchaser agrees that following the Closing, Seller and/or its
independent auditors shall have reasonable access during normal business
hours to the books and records of the Business as they relate to the period
prior to Closing and shall have the reasonable assistance and cooperation of
the appropriate personnel of Purchaser and its Affiliates in the review of
such books and records and in the preparation of the Cut-Off Date Net Book
Value of Equipment Report, the Cut-Off Date Net Assets Statement and Cash
Management Schedule; provided that such access shall not interfere with the
normal operations of the Business.  6.13 General Cooperation. From the date
hereof through the Closing, Seller and Purchaser will cooperate reasonably in
order to achieve a smooth transition consistent with the mutual business
interests of the Seller and the Purchaser. In this regard, the Seller and the
Purchaser agree that they will enter into good faith discussions concerning
the Business, including personnel policies and procedures, and other
operational matters relating to the Business.  6.14 Assigned Contracts.
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any consent,
approval or amendment required to novate and/or assign any Contract included
in the Assets, or any other Asset to be assigned to Purchaser hereunder
provided that Seller shall not be required to pay any significant amount or
offer any significant inducement in connection therewith. Seller shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed from time to time of the status of the
foregoing and Purchaser shall cooperate with Seller in this regard. To the
extent that the rights of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries under any
Contract included in the Assets, or under any other Asset to be assigned to
Purchaser hereunder, may not be assigned without the consent of another
Person which has not been obtained prior to the Closing, neither this
Agreement nor any of the Instruments of Transfer shall constitute an
agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment would be unlawful. If
any such consent has not been obtained or if any attempted assignment would
be ineffective or would impair Purchaser\'s rights under the instrument in
question so that Purchaser would not acquire the benefit of all such rights,
then Seller or a Subsidiary thereof, as applicable, to the maximum extent
permitted by Applicable Law and the instrument, shall act as Purchaser\'s
agent in order to obtain for Purchaser the benefits thereunder and shall
cooperate, to the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law and the
instrument, with Purchaser in any other reasonable arrangement designed to
provide such benefits (and the corresponding burdens) to Purchaser (including
by entering into an equivalent arrangement).  6.15 Bulk Sales Waiver.
Purchaser and Seller hereby waive compliance with the terms and conditions of
any applicable bulk sales or bulk transfer law or similar laws that may be
applicable to the bulk sale or bulk transfer of the Assets. Seller will
indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser from any and all claims relating to the
provisions of the "bulk sales law" of any applicable jurisdiction with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.  6.16 Public
Announcements. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and Purchaser will use
reasonable efforts to consult with each other about any description of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement contained in any press release or
other public statements prior to the issuance thereof and provide each other
with the opportunity to review and comment upon any such description, and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable law,
court order or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any
national securities exchange. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to
agree on the description of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
contained in any initial press releases to be issued by the parties with
respect to their execution and delivery of this Agreement.  6.17 Notices of
Certain Events. Seller and Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts
to promptly notify each other of, and cure before the Closing, any event,
transaction or circumstance, that such party learns has caused or will cause
any covenant or agreement of such party under this Agreement to be breached
or that renders or will render untrue any representation or warranty of such
party contained in this Agreement in each case so as to cause a condition to
Closing not to be satisfied. No notice given pursuant to this paragraph shall
have any effect on the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement for purposes of determining satisfaction of any
condition contained herein.  6.18 Further Assurances. Each party shall
cooperate with the other, and execute and deliver, or use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause to be executed and delivered, all such other
instruments, including instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer,
and to make all filings with and to obtain all consents, approvals or
authorizations of any Governmental Authority or other regulatory authority or
any other Person under any Permit, agreement, indenture or other instrument,
and take all such other actions as such party may reasonably be requested to
take by the other party hereto from time to time, consistent with the terms
of this Agreement, in order to effectuate the provisions and purposes of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.  6.19 Covenant Not
to Compete. (a) For a period of four years from and after the Closing, the
Seller agrees that it and Transamerica Finance Corporation shall not, and
they shall cause their respective Subsidiaries not to, engage directly or
indirectly in any business that competes with the Business as it is conducted
as of the Closing in North America (a "Competitive Business"); provided,
however, that the foregoing will not preclude Seller, Transamerica Finance
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries from engaging and continuing to
engage in any businesses or activities in which they shall be engaged
immediately after the Closing, including (i) Seller\'s tank chassis leasing
business (which is currently under contract to be sold) and (ii) the
provision and marketing of direct financing leases or full payout leases or
installment loans relating to trailers, domestic containers and chassis
(where a direct financing lease shall mean a lease in which the lessee has a
purchase option to acquire the equipment subject to such lease at the end of
the lease term). Seller and Transamerica Finance Corporation shall not
request that Aegon or any of its Subsidiaries fund an initiative that is
managed, directly or indirectly, by Seller or Transamerica Finance
Corporation to engage in a Competitive Business or assist Aegon or any of its
Subsidiaries in engaging in a Competitive Business during the four-year
period described above.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
6.19(a), (i) Seller, Transamerica Finance Corporation and their
respective Subsidiaries may invest as passive investors owning not more than
10% of the outstanding shares of any class of securities of any corporation
that is engaged in any Competitive Business having a class of
securities registered pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, so
long as neither Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries in any way, either
directly or indirectly, manages or exercises control over any such
corporation or otherwise takes any part in any of its businesses, other than
exercising its rights as a shareholder, and (ii) Seller and its Subsidiaries
shall not be prohibited from acquiring a Person engaged in a Competitive
Business together with other lines of business if (A) not more than 20% of
the value of the acquired Person\'s assets (measured by the most current
financial statements published by the acquired Person in the ordinary course
of business) relates to the Competitive Business, and (B) such
Competitive Business is divested by Seller or its Subsidiary, as applicable,
within six months of its purchase.  (c) The provisions of the covenant
contained in Section 6.19(a) shall be deemed to be a separate covenant in
each of the states, cities, counties, or other political subdivisions of the
United States and in foreign countries. The parties acknowledge and agree
that the time, scope, and other provisions of Section 6.19(a) have been
specifically negotiated by sophisticated, commercial parties and specifically
hereby agree that such time, scope and other provisions are reasonable under
the circumstances. The parties further agree that if, at any time, despite
the express agreement of the parties, a court of competent jurisdiction holds
that any portion of Section 6.19(a) is unenforceable because any of the
restrictions therein are unreasonable, or for any other reason, such decision
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other
provisions of this Agreement, and the maximum restrictions of time or scope
reasonable under the circumstances, as determined by such court, will be
substituted for any such restrictions which are held unenforceable. In the
event of a breach by any party of any of the provisions of Section 6.19(a),
the parties acknowledge that such breach may cause irreparable damage
to Purchaser, the exact amount of which may be difficult to ascertain, and
the remedies at law for any such breach may be inadequate. Accordingly,
the Purchaser may be entitled, in addition to any other rights or
remedies existing in their favor, to seek specific performance and injunctive
relief in order to enforce or prevent breach of any such provisions.  6.20
Cooperation with Respect to Financing. Between the date hereof and
the Closing, Purchaser agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
secure the Financing. Between the date hereof and the Closing, Purchaser
and Seller agree to reasonably cooperate in connection with Purchaser\'s
efforts to secure the Financing, and any other financing as contemplated by
the Bank Commitment Letter, including cooperating with Purchaser in
connection with Purchaser\'s (a) obtaining appraisals of the Assets, (b)
sending notices to lessees of the change of ownership, (c) making application
for new title certificates and (d) seeking access to Seller\'s accountants
and their work papers, making employees of the Business available,
providing all information relating to the Business reasonably requested by
Purchaser, and permitting Purchaser and its accountants to conduct agreed
upon procedures with respect to the Business; provided, however, that
Seller shall not be required to incur any liability in connection therewith
unless Purchaser shall agree indemnify Seller and its Affiliates and
their directors, officers and employees harmless against any such liabilities
and all costs, damages and losses relating thereto; provided, further,
however that Purchaser shall not be obligated to so indemnify if such
liability is determined to have resulted from inaccurate information provided
by Seller. In addition, after the Closing Seller will reasonably cooperate
with Purchaser in connection with Purchaser\'s preparation of initial
and three-year historical audited (and unaudited) financial
statements (including footnotes) of the Business as required for Purchaser\'s
filings under the securities laws, including providing (i) Purchaser and
its accountants with access to Seller\'s accountants and their work papers
in accordance with customary professional standards and (ii) customary
written representations from Seller to Purchaser\'s accountants.  6.21
Insurance Reimbursement. In the event that following the Cut-Off Date and
prior to the Closing Date, a claim arises under Seller\'s
insolvency insurance policy with Royal Belge S.A. d\'Assurances, Seller
agrees to process the claim and remit the proceeds to Purchaser.  6.22
Contingent Guaranty. In the event that Parent, or another entity with net
assets in excess of $5 billion, is no longer the owner of Seller, or Seller
has net assets of less than $2 billion, the parties agree that Transamerica
Finance Corporation shall guarantee the obligations and performance of Seller
under this Agreement.  6.23 Transition Services Agreement. Seller and
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith a customary transition services
agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement") to be entered into at the
Closing pursuant to which Seller will provide to Purchaser (at a cost to be
paid by Purchaser equal to Seller\'s cost consistent with Seller\'s past
practices) for the benefit of the Business the services presently being
provided to the Business and not being transferred to Purchaser (other than
certain headquarters level administrative services, such as legal services)
for a reasonable transition period; provided that Purchaser shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to migrate from such transitional services as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing; and provided, further,
that the manner in which Seller will fulfill its obligations under
the Transition Services Agreement (e.g., providing services presently
being provided to the Business) shall be adjusted as necessary in light
of changing circumstances (including employee departures). The parties
agree to use their best efforts to finalize the Transition Services
Agreement within 30 days after the date hereof.   ARTICLE VII   EMPLOYEE
MATTERS  7.1 Business Employees. "Business Employees" shall mean: (a) all
persons employed by Seller or any of its Affiliates in the Business
immediately before the Closing; (b) all employees of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (i) who are absent from work with the Business on account of
sickness, vacation or leave of absence (including any person on disability
leave who is able to return to active employment with Purchaser within six
months following the Closing Date or any longer period required by Applicable
Law) or (ii) for whom an obligation to recall, rehire or otherwise return
to employment exists under Applicable Law or contract; and (c) the
shared services and headquarters personnel, whose names are set forth in
Section 7.1 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Seller has provided Purchaser
with a preliminary list of Business Employees, including each such
employee\'s job/position/title, salary or grade level, target bonus and
supervisor\'s name, and Seller will provide Purchaser with an update to such
list of Business Employees prior to the Closing based upon new employees
hired by the Business and departures of Business Employees as of the date of
such update, and upon mutually agreed to additions to and deletions from
the shared services and headquarters personnel set forth on such list.  7.2
Employment. (a) Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make an
offer of employment to each Business Employee selected by Purchaser in its
sole discretion, provided that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, no later than 30 days prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser
shall provide Seller with a final list of the Business Employees to whom
Purchaser will make offers. To the extent that, as of the Closing Date,
Purchaser does not make or honor such offers to any of the Business Employees
set forth on Purchaser\'s final offer list, Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates for all wages, salaries and other
employee benefit costs payable in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in respect of such
Business Employees, during the period from the date of delivery of the final
list to Seller by Purchaser (no less than 30 days prior to the Closing Date)
through and including the Closing Date (on the same basis as such costs will
be reimbursed to Seller by Purchaser for the period between the Cut-Off Date
and the Closing Date in accordance with Section 2.7). Subject to Purchaser\'s
obligations under this Agreement, Purchaser\'s offers of employment shall be
on terms and conditions determined by Purchaser. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, Purchaser\'s hiring procedures will comply
with Applicable Law. Purchaser\'s employment of those Business Employees who
accept offers of employment shall be deemed to commence on the Closing Date.
Those Business Employees who have been offered employment by Purchaser and
who accept such offers of employment shall be referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees," and the parties hereto intend that there shall be
continuity of employment following the Closing with respect to all
Transferred Employees.  (b) Except as set forth in Section 7.7 with respect
to TARRP Payments, the severance and outplacement benefits under the
Separation Pay Plan and the payments under the LTIP, which are hereby
expressly retained by Seller, after the Closing, Seller shall not be
responsible for wages, salaries and other employee benefits for Transferred
Employees for the service of such Transferred Employees with the Purchaser
after the Cut-Off Date, provided that, with respect to the period from the
Cut-Off Date to the day prior to Closing Date, Purchaser\'s liability for
wages, salaries and other employee benefits shall be in accordance with
Section 2.7. Purchaser shall be responsible for paying or providing (or, for
the period after the Cut-Off Date to the day prior to the Closing Date,
reimbursing Seller for the cost of paying or providing, in accordance with
Section 2.7) any wages, salaries and other employee benefits (other than as
provided in Section 7.7 with respect to TARRP Payments, the severance and
outplacement benefits under the Separation Pay Plan and the payments under
the LTIP) to all Transferred Employees, for all periods following the Cut-Off
Date.  7.3 Employee Benefits. (a) Subject to the other provisions of this
Article VII, Purchaser agrees that for a period of at least one year after
the Closing Date it will (i) provide Transferred Employees with a wage
and salary program no less favorable than that in place at the
Business immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) provide all
Transferred Employees with compensation and benefits which are no less
favorable than the compensation (including incentive compensation) and
benefit plans, programs and policies of general applicability that are
provided to similarly situated employees of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
(and excluding for this purpose individual negotiated commission
arrangements). Effective as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser will count the
service of each Transferred Employee with Seller and its Affiliates (and
their predecessor entities) for purposes of determining each
Transferred Employee\'s eligibility to participate in and eligibility for
benefits (including but not limited to, vesting, and eligibility for
early retirement, benefit forms, eligibility for early retirement subsidies,
but not including benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan
of Purchaser) under each of Purchaser\'s or its Affiliate\'s employee
benefit plans, programs or arrangements that are provided to such
Transferred Employees. With respect to Transferred Employees, Purchaser\'s or
its Affiliate\'s medical and health plans shall take into account
expenses incurred by Transferred Employees (during the plan year in which
the Closing Date occurs) under Seller\'s medical and health plans for
purposes of determining deductibles and out-of-pocket limits under
Purchaser\'s or its Affiliate\'s medical and health plans for the remainder
of the plan year, and Purchaser\'s welfare benefit plans shall waive all
limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Transferred Employees. With respect to vacation, severance, and service
related awards provided by Purchaser or its Affiliates, the seniority or
period of service of each Transferred Employee shall include periods of
service with Seller and its Affiliates (and their predecessor entities). On
the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Purchaser with a schedule setting
forth the years of credited service under Seller\'s benefit and compensation
plans, programs and policies for each Transferred Employee. Except as set
forth in Section 7.7 with respect to TARRP Payments, the severance and
outplacement benefits under the Separation Pay Plan and the payments under
the LTIP, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall be solely
responsible for all termination and severance benefits, costs, charges and
Liabilities of any nature incurred with respect to a Transferred Employee
after the Cut-Off Date, including any claims arising out of or relating to
any plant closing, mass layoff, termination or similar event under Applicable
Law occurring on or after the Closing Date.  (b) As of the Closing Date,
the Transferred Employees shall cease active participation in each Benefit
Plan of Seller or its Affiliates and no additional benefits shall be accrued
thereunder for the Transferred Employees, except as provided under Section
7.7 with respect to TARRP Payments, the severance and outplacement benefits
under the Separation Pay Plan and the payments under the LTIP.  7.4
Assumption of Liabilities. Except as specifically provided otherwise in this
Article VII, at the Closing, Purchaser shall assume all employee-related
obligations for wages, salaries and benefits payable in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice for the period from the Cut-off
Date to the day prior to the Closing Date, and all other employee-related
Liabilities that arise after the Closing Date with respect to Transferred
Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents; provided, however, that
Purchaser, except as specifically provided otherwise in this Article VII,
shall not assume any Liabilities that are payable prior to, at or after the
Closing with respect to (a) any Benefit Plans that are maintained by Seller
or its Affiliates, or (b) with respect to Business Employees who do not
become Transferred Employees (other than Liabilities for the wages, salaries
and employee benefits of the Business Employees for the period from the Cut-
Off Date to the day prior to the Closing Date in accordance with Section
2.7). Seller shall retain, pay and be responsible for all Liabilities
referred to in clauses (a) and (b) of the immediately preceding
sentence.  7.5 Retirement Plan for Salaried Business Employees. As of the
Closing, the Transferred Employees shall cease active participation in the
Retirement Plan, and no additional benefits shall accrue thereunder, except
as provided under Section 7.7 with respect to TARRP Payments. Effective as
of the Closing, Seller shall fully vest the Transferred Employees in
their accrued retirement benefits under the Retirement Plan. Seller and
its Affiliates shall retain all assets and Liabilities for accrued
retirement benefits under the Retirement Plan.  7.6 401(k) Plan. (a)
Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall establish a defined contribution
plan and trust for (or cause an existing defined contribution plan to cover)
the Transferred Employees, who are eligible to participate in the
Transamerica Employees Stock Savings Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan"), which
shall be qualified under Sections 401 and 501 of the Code and shall provide
for salary reduction contributions pursuant to Section 401(k) of the Code
(the "Purchaser DC Plan"). Effective as of the Closing, Seller shall fully
vest the account balances of the Transferred Employees under the Seller
401(k) Plan. On the Closing, Purchaser shall provide Seller with evidence
reasonably satisfactory to Seller that such Purchaser DC Plan has been
established and is so qualified.  (b) As of and following the Closing, the
Purchaser DC Plan shall permit and accept a plan to plan transfer of the
assets and liabilities associated with the account balances of the
Transferred Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan. Seller shall cause a cash
transfer to be made from the Seller 401(k) Plan in an amount equal to the
account balances of the Transferred Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan to
the Purchaser DC Plan as soon as practicable after the Closing Date;
provided, however, that in no event shall the transfer take place until the
later of (i) the date that Purchaser provides Seller with a favorable
determination letter from the IRS (or an opinion of counsel) with respect to
the qualification of the Purchaser DC Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code,
and (ii) the date that Seller provides Purchaser with a favorable
determination letter from the IRS (or an opinion of counsel) with respect to
the qualification of the Seller 401(k) Plan under Section 401(a) of the Code,
provided, further, that the transfer shall occur prior to the 180 day
anniversary of the Closing Date. If practicable, the transfer shall be made
as of the last day of the first calendar quarter ending after the Closing
Date. The transfer shall be made in cash. Any outstanding plan loans to
Transferred Employees shall be transferred with the underlying accounts. The
account balances of the Transferred Employees shall be valued as of the date
on which the transfer is made. The account balances of Transferred Employees
in the Seller 401(k) Plan shall share in the earnings, appreciation
and depreciation of the investment funds in which the accounts are invested
for the period between the Closing and the date on which the transfer is
made. Any benefits that are payable to Transferred Employees from the
Seller 401(k) Plan after the Closing and before assets are transferred shall
be paid from the Seller 401(k) Plan in the ordinary course.  (c) The
account balances to be credited under the Purchaser DC Plan for Transferred
Employees shall not be less than the account balances of the Transferred
Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan as of the date on which the transfer
is made, and the transfer shall be made in accordance with Applicable Law.
Effective on the date of the transfer of Seller 401(k) Plan assets, (i) the
Purchaser DC Plan shall assume all Liabilities in connection with the account
balances of Transferred Employees under the Seller 401(k) Plan, and (ii)
Seller, its Affiliates and the Seller 401(k) Plan shall have no further
liability with respect to the Transferred Employees\' participation in and
account balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan. Subject to compliance with the
provisions of this Section 7.6, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no
liability with respect to the Purchaser DC Plan.  7.7 TARRP. (a) For the
period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on July 20, 2002 (the "TARRP
Continuation Period"), Seller shall continue to provide Transferred
Employees, whose employment with Purchaser is terminated under circumstances
that make them eligible for benefits under the Transamerica Retention and
Retirement Program ("TARRP"), including a termination by the Transferred
Employee due to Purchaser\'s failure to provide a "Comparable Position" as
defined in TARRP, with the "TARRP Payment" (as defined in TARRP) under TARRP
as in effect from time to time. For purposes of calculating the TARRP Payment
of an eligible Transferred Employee, Seller shall count such eligible
Transferred Employee\'s service with Purchaser and its Affiliates in addition
to prior service with Seller and its Affiliates. During the TARRP
Continuation Period, Purchaser shall provide each Transferred Employee who is
entitled to a TARRP Payment with "Outplacement Assistance" (as defined in
TARRP) in accordance with the program disclosed on Section 4.11(b) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule and Purchaser shall be solely liable for such
benefits. To the extent a Transferred Employee is not eligible for or does
not elect TARRP benefits upon a termination of employment from Purchaser
(including a termination by the Transferred Employee due to Purchaser\'s
failure to provide a "Comparable Position" as defined in TARRP) during the
TARRP Continuation Period, such employee shall be entitled to receive
benefits under the Separation Pay Plan and outplacement assistance (on the
same basis as provided to terminated Transferred Employees who are receiving
TARRP Payments), and Seller shall be solely liable for the payment of
such separation benefits and outplacement assistance. In addition, to the
extent a Transferred Employee is entitled to receive payments under the
LTIP, Seller shall be solely liable for the payment of such amounts.  (b)
Purchaser agrees (i) that only Transferred Employees whose termination is a
"bona fide" termination (as defined herein) will be reported as terminated
from Purchaser for purposes of TARRP, (ii) that such terminated Transferred
Employees may not be rehired by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates within six
months of their termination date, (iii) to notify Seller of a bona fide
termination at least 75 days prior to the planned termination date, (iv) to
cooperate with Seller in providing the required TARRP notice to the
Transferred Employees at least 60 days prior to the termination date, and (v)
to cooperate in fulfilling all other requirements of TARRP. A termination of
employment from the Purchaser for purposes of this Agreement will be
considered "bona fide" only if it constitutes a "retirement" (rather than a
termination permitting the distribution of just ancillary or incidental
benefits) under Treas. Regs. Section 1.401-1(b)(1) or a "severance of
employment" under Revenue Ruling 56-693 or is a termination by the
Transferred Employee due to Purchaser\'s failure to provide a "Comparable
Position" as defined in TARRP. Furthermore, a termination of employment will
not be considered "bona fide" for purposes of this Agreement if at the time
of the Transferred Employee\'s eligibility for TARRP, there is any express or
implied agreement or understanding that such employee will be rehired or will
provide services in the future in any capacity to Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates.  7.8 Workers\' Compensation. At Closing, Purchaser shall assume
all Liabilities for all claims under workers\' compensation laws that
are payable after the Cut-Off Date with respect to Transferred
Employees, without regard to when the Liabilities arose; provided, however,
that Seller shall retain, pay and be responsible for any Liability for
worker\'s compensation claims incurred with respect to the Transferred
Employees prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that such claims are
covered by Seller\'s workers compensation insurance.  7.9 Vacation Pay. As
soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall pay
all Liabilities for unpaid vacation pay earned, banked or accrued by
Transferred Employees prior to the Closing Date. Subject to the foregoing and
Applicable Law, on and after the Closing, Seller shall have no Liability for
vacation pay for Transferred Employees.  7.10 Welfare Plans. (a) Seller
shall be liable for and shall hold Purchaser harmless from and against all
claims for welfare benefits by Business Employees that are incurred prior to
the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall be liable and shall hold Seller
harmless from and against all claims for welfare benefits by Transferred
Employees that are incurred on or after the Closing Date. For purposes of
this Agreement, the following claims shall be deemed to be incurred as
follows: (i) life, accidental death and dismemberment and business travel
accident insurance benefits, upon the date of death or accident giving rise
to such benefits, (ii) health, dental, vision and/or prescription drug
benefits, on the date such services, materials or supplies were provided and
(iii) disability income benefits, on the date of disability as determined by
the disability carrier for the individual.  (b) Seller shall be responsible
for satisfying the obligations under Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), to provide continuation coverage to or with
respect to any Business Employee and their beneficiaries in accordance with
law with respect to any "qualifying event" occurring before the Closing Date,
or occurring on or after the Closing Date if such Business Employee does not
become a Transferred Employee. Purchaser shall be responsible for satisfying
the obligations under COBRA to provide continuation coverage to or with
respect to any Transferred Employee or their beneficiaries with respect to
any "qualifying event" which occurs on or after the Closing Date.  (c)
Seller shall be liable for and shall hold Purchaser harmless from and against
any retiree welfare benefits to be provided to retirees of the Business who
have actually retired prior to the Closing Date.  7.11 Educational
Assistance Policy. To the extent a Transferred Employee successfully
completes a course that is in progress prior to the Cut-Off Date, the
expenses for which are reimbursable under the Seller Educational Assistance
Policy, Seller shall reimburse such Transferred Employee for the eligible
expenses under the terms and conditions of the Seller Educational Assistance
Policy. The eligible expenses for any courses initiated and successfully
completed by a Transferred Employee on or after the Cut-Off Date shall be
reimbursed by the Purchaser under the Purchaser employee educational
assistance plan.  7.12 Adoption Assistance Policy. To the extent a
Transferred Employee incurs eligible expenses for an adoption of a child, the
expenses for which are reimbursable under the Seller Adoption Benefit Plan,
prior to the Cut-Off Date, Seller shall reimburse such Transferred Employee
for the eligible expenses under the terms and conditions of the Seller
Adoption Benefit Plan. Eligible expenses incurred by a Transferred Employee
on or after the Cut-Off Date shall be reimbursed by the Purchaser under
the Purchaser adoption benefit plan. For purposes hereof, an expense shall
be considered to be "incurred" when the services giving rise to the
expense are rendered.  7.13 Bonuses. With respect to the payment of the
annual bonuses earned by the Transferred Employees in respect of the 2000
calendar year (the "2000 Incentive Bonus") under the applicable annual bonus
plans of Seller as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date (the
"Seller Bonus Plan"), Seller shall pay and be solely liable for the
proportionate share of the 2000 Incentive Bonus for the period commencing on
January 1, 2000 and ending on the Cut-Off Date, and Purchaser shall pay and
be solely liable for the proportionate share of the 2000 Incentive Bonus
under the Seller Bonus Plan for the period commencing on the day after the
Cut-Off Date and ending on December 31, 2000 (or such earlier date of
termination of a Company Employee). The Seller\'s portion of a Transferred
Employee\'s 2000 Incentive Bonus shall be determined in accordance with the
Exhibit to the Seller Bonus Plan entitled "Amounts Payable from Incentive
Compensation Plan if Changes in Employment Occur Pursuant to the Plan
General Provisions." The Purchaser\'s portion of a Transferred Employee\'s
2000 Incentive Bonus, whether paid or payable for the period ending on
December 31, 2000 or, if earlier, the period ending on such Transferred
Employee\'s termination of employment from Purchaser, shall be determined
based on the Transferred Employee\'s target bonus percentage previously
disclosed to Purchaser for the 2000 bonus year.  7.14 Plant Closing Laws.
Purchaser shall be responsible for providing any notice required pursuant to
the United States Federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988, any
successor United States federal law, and any other applicable plant closing
notification law with respect to a layoff or plant closing relating to the
Business that occurs as a result of or after the Closing caused by Purchaser
on or after the Closing Date with respect to individuals employed by Seller
in the Business prior to the Closing Date. For this purpose, Purchaser shall
be deemed to have caused a mass layoff if the mass layoff would not have
occurred but for Purchaser\'s failure to offer employment to the Business
Employees. Seller agrees to cooperate with Purchaser to enable Purchaser to
comply with its obligation hereunder.  7.15 Employee Communications. From
the date hereof through the Closing, Seller and Purchaser agree to promptly
give the other party prior written notice of, and to coordinate with the
other party with respect to, any written communication to be delivered by
Seller or Purchaser to the Business Employees regarding matters contained in
or relating to the transactions contemplated under this Agreement or benefits
or employment conditions that may or will apply to Transferred Employees.  
ARTICLE VIII   CONDITIONS TO THE CLOSING  8.1 Conditions of Obligation of

Assumed Liabilities contemplated hereby are subject to the satisfaction, at
or prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:  (a) No

following additional conditions:  (a) Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of Seller contained in Article IV of this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date as
though made at and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that any
representation and warranty is made as of a specified date other than the
Closing Date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct in all respects as of such date, in each case, except where the
failure to be so true and correct would not have a Material Adverse Effect
(without giving effect to "materiality", "material" or Material Adverse
Effect qualifications contained in such representations and warranties). In
determining whether this condition is satisfied, any Excluded Liabilities
(and any changes in Excluded Liabilities) shall not be taken into
account.  (b) Performance of Covenants. Seller shall have performed in all
material respects all obligations and agreements, and complied in all
material respects with all covenants, contained in this Agreement to be
performed or complied with by it prior to or at the Closing Date.  (c)

terms reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser and its counsel, the net proceeds
of the Financing contemplated by the Bank Commitment Letter or of
other financing in the same aggregate amount which is on terms
substantially similar to (and no less favorable to Purchaser than) those set
forth in the Bank Commitment Letter heretofore delivered to Seller (without
regard to any amendments or changes that may from time to time be made to the
Bank Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms thereof),
sufficient, together with available cash, to (i) consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) pay the fees and expenses of
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.  8.3 Additional Conditions to the Obligations of Seller. The
obligation of Seller to consummate the sale of the Assets and assumption by
Purchaser of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated hereby is subject to the
satisfaction, at or prior to the Closing Date, of each of the following
additional conditions:  (a) Representations and Warranties. The
representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in Article V of this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all respects as of the Closing Date as
though made at and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that any
representation and warranty is made as of a specified date other than the
Closing Date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct in all respects as of such date, in each case, except where the
failure to be so true and correct would not have a material adverse effect on
the benefits to be provided to Seller from the transactions contemplated
hereby. In determining whether this condition is satisfied, any Assumed
Liabilities (and any changes in Assumed Liabilities) shall not be taken into
account.  (b) Performance of Covenants. Purchaser shall have performed in

paragraphs (a) and (b) above have been fulfilled.   ARTICLE IX  
TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER  9.1 Termination. This Agreement may be
terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby abandoned at any time
prior to the Closing Date:  (a) By mutual written consent of Seller and
Purchaser;  (b) By either party upon written notice given to the other party
in the event of a breach or default in the performance by such other party of
any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement which breach or default (i) would result in a failure of a
condition set forth in Section 8.1 or 8.2 (in the case of a breach by Seller)
or Section 8.1 or 8.3 (in the case of a breach by Purchaser) to be satisfied
and (ii) has not been, or cannot be, cured within 60 days of written notice
of such breach or default which is given by the terminating party to the
breaching or defaulting party;  (c) By either party upon written notice to
the other party in the event that any Governmental Authority (including any
court of competent jurisdiction) the consent of which is necessary for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the purchase of
the Assets and/or assumption of the Assumed Liabilities hereunder, and such
order, decree or ruling shall have become final and non-appealable; or  (d)
By either party upon written notice given to the other party in the event
that the Closing shall not have taken place on or before December 31, 2000;
provided, that the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such date is
not the result of a breach of any covenant, agreement, representation or
warranty hereunder by the party seeking such termination.  9.2 Effect of
Termination. (a) In the event of the termination of this Agreement as
provided above, this Agreement (other than this Section) shall become void
and of no further force and effect and, other than in the event of a
termination pursuant to Section 9.1(b) as a result of a willful material
breach or default of any covenant or agreement by the non-terminating party
and other than as provided in Section 2.5(b) and Section 9.2(b), there shall
be no duties, liabilities or obligations of any kind or nature whatsoever on
the part of either party hereto to the other party based either upon this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except that the
obligations of the parties referred to in Sections 4.18 and 5.5, the
penultimate sentence of Section 6.2 and Section 12.2(a), (b), (d) and (e)
shall continue to apply following any such termination of this
Agreement.  (b) Purchaser and Seller agree that Purchaser is to bear a
significant portion of any risk associated with the financing condition set
forth in Section 8.2(e). Accordingly, in order to induce Seller to enter into
this Agreement, Purchaser and Seller agree that Purchaser shall pay
Seller promptly upon termination of the Agreement an amount of $10 million
(minus the amount of the Down Payment plus Accrued Interest thereon) in
liquidated damages if at the time of termination the conditions to
Purchaser\'s obligations to consummate the purchase of the Assets and
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities contemplated hereby that are set forth
in Sections 8.1(a) and (b) and Section 8.2 (other than the requirements of
Section 8.2(e)) shall have been satisfied (or Seller shall have been willing
and able to fulfill such conditions upon due notice). Such payment will be
made upon demand by Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Seller. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)
Purchaser shall not be required to pay the amount described above if the
failure of the condition set forth in Section 8.2(e) to be satisfied shall
have been caused by Seller\'s breach of this Agreement (which, if curable,
shall not have been cured within five Business Days of written notice
referring to this Section) and (ii) if all of the conditions to Purchaser\'s
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the requirements of Section 8.2(e)) shall have been satisfied or waived
by Purchaser and Purchaser shall have offered to consummate the Closing,
but the Agreement shall be terminated without the Closing having been
taken place as a result of Seller\'s not being willing to waive any
closing condition it has under this Agreement, then Purchaser shall not
be obligated to pay the amount described above (and Seller shall have
any other rights it has under this Agreement.).   The parties agree that,
unless there is a willful and material breach by Purchaser of any of its
obligations under this Agreement, the liquidated damages amount set forth in
this Section 9.2(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller for any
claim, loss, cost, expense, damage or liability or obligation relating to the
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby in the event such amount
is payable and paid to Seller and that such amount is reasonable in
proportion to the probable damages likely to be sustained by Seller if the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated under such
circumstances. The parties agree and acknowledge that the amount of actual
damages to be sustained by Seller in the event of the nonconsummation of the
transaction under the circumstances referred to above is uncertain and
difficult to predict at this time and incapable of precise estimation. This
Section 9.2(b) shall survive any termination of this Agreement. Any amount
paid under this Section 9.2(b) shall be applied against any damages to
which Seller may be entitled for a willful material breach by Purchaser so
that Seller shall not be compensated twice for the same loss.  9.3
Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, each of the parties
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or acts of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto, (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements of the other party contained herein or (d) waive any condition to
its obligations hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party.   ARTICLE X   TAX
MATTERS  10.1 Post-Closing Tax and Accounting Matters. Following the
Closing, each of Purchaser and Seller will furnish to the other, at the
other\'s expense, such necessary and available information and access to the
personnel of Purchaser and its Affiliates or Seller and its Affiliates, as
the case may be, as the other may reasonably request in connection with Tax
and accounting matters of the other relating to the Assets. Purchaser
and Seller will not destroy any information which is subject to this
Section 10.1 for a period of six years after the Closing Date and thereafter
shall not destroy any such information without giving at least 60 days\'
written notice to the other, and, if the other so requests within 60 days
of receipt of such notice, Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be,
shall deliver to the other or to its order, at the other\'s expense,
such information intended to be destroyed.  10.2 Allocation of
Consideration. Seller and Purchaser agree that they shall use, and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, their reasonable best efforts to
enter into an agreement (the "Allocation Agreement") as to the allocation of
the Purchase Price (as adjusted pursuant to Article II) and the Assumed
Liabilities among the Assets acquired hereunder. Purchaser shall initially
prepare a draft of the Allocation Agreement (the "Proposed Allocation") and
shall submit such Proposed Allocation to Seller within 90 days after the
Closing Date. If, within 60 days after Seller\'s receipt of the Proposed
Allocation, Seller shall not have objected in writing to such Proposed
Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become the Allocation Agreement. In
the event that Seller objects in writing within such 60 day period and Seller
and Purchaser are unable to reach an agreement, the dispute shall be
referred to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to
Seller and Purchaser (the "Accounting Firm") for resolution, and the
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be binding upon Seller and
Purchaser and their respective Subsidiaries and shall constitute the
Allocation Agreement, with Seller and Purchaser each bearing one-half of the
costs, fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm. Seller and Purchaser agree
to act, and to cause their respective Subsidiaries to act, in accordance with
the allocations contained in the Allocation Agreement determined pursuant to
this Section 10.2. Purchaser shall initially prepare for delivery to Seller a
completed set of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594, including all
additional information and materials required to be attached to such Form
8594 pursuant to the Treasury Regulations under Section 1060 of the Code.
Such documents and forms shall be delivered to Seller for review no later
than 60 days prior to the date any such forms are required to be filed. For
all purposes hereunder, any indemnification payments pursuant to Article
XI shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.   ARTICLE
XI   INDEMNIFICATION  11.1 By Seller. (a) Subject to subsections (b) and
(c) of this Section 11.1, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser,
its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and
assigns and related entities from, and reimburse them for any, loss, cost
deficiency, demand, assessment, expense (including all reasonable legal and
expert fees and expenses), damage (including damages to Persons, property or
the environment), liability, fines, penalties or claims but not
including consequential, punitive or special damages (collectively, the
"Indemnified Costs") arising out of or resulting from:  (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Seller in this Agreement;  (ii)
Seller\'s breach of or failure to perform any of its covenants or agreements
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (except with respect to any
Excluded Liability or Excluded Asset to which clauses (iii) and (v),
respectively, shall apply);  (iii) any Excluded Liability (whether known or
unknown at the time of Closing);  (iv) any failure to comply with the terms
and conditions of any applicable bulk sales or bulk transfer or similar laws
that may be applicable to the bulk sale or bulk transfer of the Assets,
notwithstanding Section 6.15; and  (v) any Excluded Asset.  (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no liability:  (i) to the
extent of any insurance or other recovery received by a Person entitled to
indemnification under Section 11.1(a) in respect of an Indemnified Cost an
"Offsetting Recovery") (provided that the net present value of all actual
increases (in the following year) in insurance premiums which are directly
attributable to any such Indemnified Cost (the "Premium Recapture") is
deducted from any such Offsetting Recovery for purposes of this Section
11.1(b)(i), provided further, however, that the Premium Recapture shall not
exceed the amount of the Offsetting Recovery); and  (ii) to the extent that
Purchaser or any Affiliate thereof realizes a Tax Benefit on or before the
fourth anniversary of the Closing Date which is directly attributable to such
Indemnified Cost.  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall have no
liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) or (ii) unless
the aggregate of all Indemnified Costs under Section 11.1(a)(i) or (ii) for
which Seller would, but for this subsection (c), be liable exceeds on a
cumulative basis an amount equal to $6 million, in which case Seller\'s
liability shall be only for such excess, nor shall Seller be liable for any
such Indemnified Costs that, when added to the amounts that Seller has
otherwise paid pursuant to Section 11.1(a)(i) or (ii), exceed the amount of
$100 million. Seller shall not be liable to pay Indemnified Costs more than
once with respect to an Indemnified Cost resulting from the same facts,
events or circumstances, even if such facts, events or circumstances
constitute both an Excluded Liability and a breach of any representations and
warranties for which Seller shall or would but for this provision be
obligated to pay Indemnified Costs hereunder, provided, however, Seller shall
be liable to pay for Indemnified Costs that arise out of the same facts,
events or circumstances when the Indemnified Costs resulting from such facts,
events or circumstances that are not duplicative or result in damages, costs
or liabilities that were not indemnified pursuant to the first
such indemnification payment.  11.2 By Purchaser. (a) Subject to
subsections (b) and (c) of this Section 11.2, Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold Parent, Seller, and their Affiliates, officers, directors, employees,
agents, successors, and assigns, and related entities from, and reimburse
them for, Indemnified Costs arising or resulting from:  (i) any breach of
any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this Agreement;  (ii)
Purchaser\'s breach of or failure to perform any of its covenants
or agreements contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement (except
with respect to any Assumed Liability or Asset to which clauses (iii) and
(iv), respectively, shall apply);  (iii) any Assumed Liability;  (iv) any
Asset; and  (v) the ownership of the Assets or the operation or conduct of
the Business, in each case from and after the Closing Date other than
with respect to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities.  (b)
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no liability to
the extent that Parent, Seller or any Affiliate thereof realizes a Tax
Benefit which is directly attributable to such Indemnified Cost on or before
the fourth anniversary of the Closing Date or receives insurance or
other recovery in respect of an Indemnified Cost.  (c) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have no liability for indemnification pursuant to
Section 11.2(a)(i) or (ii) unless the aggregate of all Indemnified Costs
under Section 11.2(a)(i) or (ii) for which Purchaser would, but for this
subsection (c), be liable exceeds on a cumulative basis an amount equal to $6
million, in which case Purchaser\'s liability shall be only for such excess,
nor shall Purchaser be liable for any such Indemnified Costs that, when added
to the amounts that Purchaser has otherwise paid pursuant to Section
11.2(a)(i) or (ii), exceed the amount of $100 million. Purchaser shall not be
liable to pay Indemnified Costs more than once with respect to an Indemnified
Cost resulting from the same facts, events or circumstances, even if such
facts, events or circumstances constitute both an Assumed Liability and a
breach of any representations and warranties for which Purchaser shall or
would but for this provision be obligated to pay Indemnified Costs hereunder,
provided, however, Purchaser shall be liable to pay for Indemnified Costs
that arise out of the same facts, events or circumstances when the
Indemnified Costs resulting from such facts, events or circumstances that are
not duplicative or result in damages, costs or liabilities that were not
indemnified pursuant to the first such indemnification payment.  11.3
Indemnification Procedure. (a) Any Person claiming indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement shall promptly notify the indemnifying party in writing of
the occurrence of any event that such party asserts is or may be an
indemnifiable event pursuant to this Agreement and shall describe
in reasonable detail the facts, events and circumstances relating to
the subject matter of such claim and the amount (if reasonably calculable)
of the Indemnified Costs in connection therewith. If such event involves
the claim of any third party, the indemnifying party shall be entitled
to participate in and, to the extent it shall wish, assume control over
(in which case the indemnifying party shall assume all expense with respect
to) the defense, settlement, adjustment or compromise of such claim.  (b)
The indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any
action or claim and to participate in the defense thereof at the expense of
the indemnifying party only (i) if the retention of such counsel has been
specifically authorized by the indemnifying party or (ii) if the counsel is
retained because the indemnifying party does not notify the indemnified party
within 60 days after receipt of a claim notice that it elects to undertake
the defense thereof.  (c) The indemnifying party shall obtain the prior
written approval of the indemnified party before entering into any
settlement, adjustment, or compromise of such claim or ceasing to defend
against such claim that provides for any relief other than the payment of
monetary damages with respect to the indemnified party.  (d) If the
indemnifying party does not assume control over the defense of such claim as
provided in Section 11.3(a) within 60 days of receipt of notice thereof, the
indemnified party shall have the right to defend the claim in such manner as
it may deem appropriate and to settle, adjust, or compromise such claim and
shall not thereby waive any right to indemnification hereunder.  (e) In the
event that the indemnifying party reimburses the indemnified party for any
third party claim, the indemnified party shall remit to the indemnifying
party any reimbursement that the indemnified party subsequently receives for
such third party claim.  (f) Any matter as to which a claim has been
asserted by written notice in accordance with Section 11.3(a) to the
indemnifying party that is pending or unresolved at the end of any applicable
survival period shall continue, to the extent permitted by law, to be covered
by this Article XI notwithstanding any applicable statute of limitations
(which the parties hereby toll with respect to each other) or the expiration
of such survival period until such matter is finally terminated or otherwise
resolved by the parties under this Agreement or by a court of competent
jurisdiction and any amounts payable hereunder are finally determined and
paid.  (g) The right to indemnification pursuant to this Section 11.3 shall
not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the date the
Closing occurs, with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance
with, any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation.  11.4 Survival.
Except for the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.1 and
Section 4.2, each of which shall survive forever, and Section 4.12 and
Section 4.14(a), each of which shall survive until 30 days after the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (as such periods may be
extended by request of the applicable Governmental Authority) with respect to
such representations and warranties, the remaining representations and
warranties made herein or in any other documentation delivered pursuant to
this Agreement and the covenants and agreements to be performed on or prior
to the Closing Date shall survive until the completion of the audit for the
year ending December 31, 2001 but no later than March 31, 2002; provided,
that (a) expiration of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
shall not affect the obligations of a Party with respect to claims for
indemnification for which notice has been given to the indemnifying party in
accordance with Section 11.3 prior to such expiration and (b) all covenants,
agreements and indemnification matters that contemplate or may involve
actions to be taken or obligations in effect after the Closing shall survive
until the third anniversary of the Closing Date unless otherwise provided
herein or unless it is evident from the context that such obligations should
survive beyond that date; provided, that this clause (b) shall not apply to
the indemnification obligations of Seller under Sections 11.1(a)(iii), (iv)
and (v), or of Purchaser under Sections 11.2(a)(iii), (iv) and (v).  11.5
Exclusivity. The indemnification provided in this Article XI shall be the
exclusive remedy for a breach of any representation or warranty in
this Agreement or of the covenant set forth in Section 6.1(b)(xiii),
provided that no party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any right of
recourse (whether a claim under this Article XI or otherwise) arising
from fraudulent conduct of any other party hereto.  11.6 Limits on
Environmental Indemnification. Each of Purchaser and Seller shall inform the
other promptly in writing upon its receipt of any Third Party Environmental
Claim or its obtaining Knowledge (as defined for purposes of this sentence in
the immediately following sentence) of any basis for any Third Party
Environmental Claim or any Release or requirement for a Cleanup, provided
that the failure of a party to so promptly inform the other party shall not
affect the rights or obligations of either party (including indemnification
rights or obligations) except to the extent that such failure to give prompt
notice adversely affects the other party. For purpose of the preceding
sentence, "Knowledge" with respect to Purchaser means the actual knowledge of
any employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries set forth on Section 11.6 to
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule, and "Knowledge" with respect to Seller
means the actual knowledge of any employees of Seller or its Subsidiaries set
forth on Section 11.6 to the Seller Disclosure Schedule, provided that each
of Purchaser and Seller shall establish mutually satisfactory policies and
procedures designed to seek to inform the persons listed on Section 11.6 to
the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule of any Third Party Environmental Claim or
any Release or requirement for a Cleanup of which any person in their
organization is aware. Subject to the provisions of Section 11.3 hereof,
Seller shall be entitled to manage and control any Cleanup and other
remediation activities undertaken in connection with its indemnification
obligations under this Agreement relating to Environmental Laws, and as such
shall have reasonable access to the Assets and the right to determine, in its
reasonable discretion, the Cleanup measures that are required to comply
with Environmental Laws; provided, however, that (i) nothing herein purports
to authorize Seller to fail or refuse to comply with or fulfill the terms
of any order of a Governmental Authority unless such order is subject
to appeal or (ii) to prevent Purchaser from taking actions with regard
to Cleanup that are reasonably required in order for it to comply
with Environmental Law. Subject to clause (ii) of the preceding sentence and
to the following sentence, Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with respect to any Third Party Environmental Claims or Cleanup,
and Purchaser shall not take any action contrary to Seller\'s
reasonable direction with respect to a Cleanup. If at any time Seller assumes
control over a matter as provided in Section 11.3, then it shall thereafter
direct the communications with respect thereto and afford Purchaser a
reasonable opportunity to participate, except that nothing herein shall
prevent Purchaser from complying with law, responding to a governmental
request for information or otherwise providing legally required notice to
a Governmental Authority, but in such cases, Purchaser shall notify
the Seller of the nature and substance of the proposed compliance with law
or communication, give Seller reasonable opportunity to comment thereon,
and not unreasonably refuse to incorporate Seller\'s comments.
Notwithstanding any other provision herein, Seller shall not be required to
indemnify Purchaser or any party indemnified hereunder due to its
relationship with Purchaser with respect to any Indemnified Costs arising out
of or attributable to (i) internal costs or overhead of any such
indemnified party or (ii) any modification or change in the operations of the
Business or use of the Assets to a non-industrial or non-commercial use after
the Closing. The indemnification provided in this Article XI shall be
the exclusive remedy with respect to any Third Party Environmental
Claim, Cleanup obligation, or other Liability relating to Environmental Laws
under this Agreement; provided that no party hereto shall be deemed to
have waived any right of recourse (whether a claim under this Article XI
or otherwise) arising from fraudulent conduct of any party hereto.  
ARTICLE XII   MISCELLANEOUS  12.1 Amendment and Modification; Waiver of
Provisions. This Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by a
written instrument executed by all of the parties hereto. The failure of any
party at any time or times to require performance of any provision of this
Agreement shall in no manner affect the right of such party at a later date
to enforce the same. No waiver by any party of any condition or the breach of
any provision, terms, covenant, representation or warranty contained in this
Agreement in any one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as
a further or continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of any
other provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty of this
Agreement.  12.2 Expenses. The parties agree that fees and out-of-pocket
expenses shall be paid as follows:  (a) Fees and disbursements of counsel,
consultants and accountants shall be paid by the party retaining such
Persons;  (b) Each party shall bear its own expenses incurred with respect
to filings under the HSR Act and obtaining all required consents,
authorizations, orders or approvals of, filings or registrations with, and
notices to, Governmental Authorities; provided that each party shall pay one
half of the filing fee under the HSR Act;  (c) Purchaser shall be
responsible for 75% and Seller shall be responsible for 25% of any sales or
transfer Taxes arising from the transfer of the Assets to Purchaser or
assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Purchaser. Seller and Purchaser
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the sales and
transfer Taxes to be allocated pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence, including by securing any reasonably available exemption and, in
the case of Purchaser, by making any available election to collect use Tax
from its lessees in lieu of the imposition of such sales or transfer Taxes,
provided that Purchaser will elect to collect use Tax from its lessees if,
and only to the extent that, Seller has collected and currently collects use
Tax from such lessee during periods prior to the Closing. Seller shall, in
consultation with Purchaser, prepare and file any Tax Returns relating to
such sales and transfer Taxes. Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing
within 10 days of receipt by Seller of written notice of any pending or
threatened audit, notice of deficiency, proposed adjustment, assessment,
examination or other administrative or judicial proceeding, suit, dispute or
other claim, in each case relating to the sales and transfer Taxes described
in the first sentence of this Section 12.2(c) (a "Sales Tax Claim"), provided
that notice under this sentence shall not be considered delinquent unless it
materially and adversely affects Purchaser\'s participation rights with
respect to such Sales Tax Claim. In the event that the Sales Tax Claim
relates exclusively to sales and transfer Taxes described in the first
sentence of this Section 12.2(c), or it is reasonably practicable to
segregate the portion of the Sales Tax Claim relating solely to sales and
transfer Taxes described in the first sentence of this Section 12.2(c),
then:   (i) if the Taxing Authority asserting a Sales Tax  Claim will allow
Purchaser to defend such Sales  Tax Claim in Purchaser\'s own name, then 
Purchaser shall conduct the defense of such  Sales Tax Claim or segregated
portion, as the  case may be, and Seller shall be entitled to  participate
at its own expense in such Sales Tax  Claim or segregated portion, as the
case may be;  or   (ii) if the Taxing Authority asserting a Sales Tax 
Claim will not allow Purchaser to defend such  Sales Tax Claim in
Purchaser\'s own name, then  Seller shall conduct the defense of such Sales 
Tax Claim or segregated portion, as the case may  be, and Purchaser shall be
entitled to  participate at its own expense in such Sales Tax  Claim or
segregated portion, as the case may be.  In the event that the Sales Tax
Claim does not relate exclusively to sales and transfer Taxes described in
the first sentence of this Section 12.2(c), and it is not reasonably
practicable to segregate the portion of the Sales Tax Claim relating solely
to sales and transfer Taxes described in the first sentence of this Section
12.2(c), Seller shall conduct such the defense of such Sales Tax Claim and
(i) Seller shall keep Purchaser fully informed of developments in such Sales
Tax Claim as it relates to sales and transfer Taxes described in the first
sentence of this Section 12.2(c), (ii) Purchaser shall be entitled to receive
appropriately redacted copies of all documents and correspondence related to
such Sales Tax Claim, and (iii) Seller shall consult in good faith with
Purchaser as to the status of such Sales Tax Claim and shall seek
Purchaser\'s counsel as to strategies to be taken in connection therewith.
The party controlling the defense of a Sales Tax Claim shall not settle or
compromise the portion of a Sales Tax Claim relating to sales and transfer
Taxes described in the first sentence of this Section 12.2(c) without the
prior written consent of the party not controlling the defense of such Sales
Tax Claim, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Seller nor Purchaser shall be required
to contest any Sales Tax Claim, provided that the party controlling the
defense of such Sales Tax Claim shall be required to contest a Sales Tax
Claim if (i) the party not controlling such Sales Tax Claim supplies an
opinion of a "Big Five" accounting firm that has had no material relationship
with such party or its Affiliates during the preceding two years or of
nationally recognized independent tax counsel, in either case to the effect
that there is a reasonable basis for such contest, and (ii) the portion of
such Sales Tax Claim relating to sales and transfer Taxes described in
Section 12.2(c) exceeds $250,000. If Seller chooses not to contest any Sales
Tax Claim asserted by a Taxing Authority which will permit Purchaser to
defend such Sales Tax Claim in Purchaser\'s own name, Purchaser may elect to
contest such Sales Tax Claim, provided that in no event will Seller be
obligated to pay more in settlement of such Sales Tax Claim than it would
have been obligated to pay with respect to such Sales Tax Claim had such
Sales Tax Claim not been contested either by Seller or by Purchaser;  (d)
Seller shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Co. and Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette, and
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses of Salomon
Smith Barney; and  (e) All other fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such expenses.  12.3 Successors and Assigns; Assignments.
All terms and provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective transferees,
successors and assigns. No party hereto may assign any of its rights or
delegate any of its obligations hereunder without the prior written consent
of the other parties, except Purchaser may assign its rights, but not its
obligations, hereunder to its financing sources and may assign certain or all
of its rights and obligations (provided it continues to fully and
unconditionally guarantee such obligations) to a subsidiary or other entity
controlled by Purchaser in connection with obtaining financing for the
transactions contemplated hereby, and any such attempted assignment or
delegation without such consent shall be null and void.  12.4 No Third
Parties Benefited. Except for the provisions of Article XI which are intended
for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, any of the Indemnified Parties
and their respective successors, heirs and personal representatives. This
Agreement is made and entered into for the protection and benefit of the
parties hereto and their permitted successors and assigns, and no other
Person shall be a direct or indirect beneficiary of or have any direct or
indirect cause of action or claim in connection with this Agreement or any of
the documents executed in connection herewith.  12.5 Notices. All notices,

hereby irrevocably waive any and all right to trial by jury in any
legal proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.  12.10 Headings. The article, section,

broad to permit enforcement of such restriction to its fullest extent, each
party agrees that such restriction may be enforced to the maximum extent
