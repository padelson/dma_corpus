as practicable but not less than five Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers shall deliver to Buyer in writing a good faith estimate of the

accordance with GAAP and prepared in the same manner as and consistent with
the audited year-end financial statements of the Company (except that target
rates of expense for periods after March 31, 2006 shall be used instead of

Closing that should have been accrued for the period ending as of the Closing
Date, but shall exclude any employee or other bonus payments (including any
Success Bonuses paid by the Company after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) and any other liabilities that have actually
been paid by the Company before the Closing. The Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet shall further include the Company\'s share of any employee withholding,
Social Security and Medicare taxes payable with respect to the Success
Bonuses and not paid by the Company before the Closing. The Estimated Closing
Balance Sheet shall also exclude any Retention Payment to be paid following
the Closing Date. The Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall further include
as a liability the Company\'s anticipated obligation to the U.S. Army Space
and Missile Defense Command in the amount of $399,099 with respect to an
anticipated task order under the MDDC Contract, to the extent not paid
or satisfied as of the date of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. The
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall further include (i) a statement of the
calculation of a good faith estimate of the Purchase Price based thereon (the
"ESTIMATED PURCHASE PRICE"), (ii) the financial information used to derive
the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Purchase Price, and
(iii) a certificate signed by Sellers to the effect that the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Purchase Price were   
-20-    derived and determined in good faith in accordance with GAAP and
prepared in the same manner as and consistent with the audited year-end
financial statements of the Company (except that target rates of expense for
periods after March 31, 2006 were used instead of actual rates of expense for
purposes of determining Net Book Value) and include any employee or other
bonus payments and any other liabilities to be paid by the Company following
the Closing that should have been accrued for the period ending as of the
Closing Date. In preparing and determining the Estimated Closing Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Purchase Price, (x) Sellers shall, and shall cause
the Company\'s independent accountants to, regularly consult with Buyer and
the Buyer\'s independent accountants and apprise them of the details of the
preparation and determination of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Purchase Price and (y) Buyer and the Buyer\'s accountants shall
have the right, and Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company\'s independent
accountants to, permit Buyer and the Buyer\'s accountants, to actively
participate in all aspects of the preparation and determination of the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Purchase Price. For such
purpose, Sellers shall afford to Buyer and the Buyer\'s accountants full and
complete access to all of the Company\'s management and books, documents and
records that relate to the Business. In addition, as part of the preparation
of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, within thirty (30) days before the
Closing Date, Sellers shall cause the Company to prepare (i) an "Estimate at
Completion" for each Applicable Contract with customers of the Company that
is a fixed-price contract and (ii) a written comparison of the Company\'s
actual rate of expense and the Company\'s target rate of expense, together
with the associated calculations, for the current fiscal year. The Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet and the Estimated Purchase Price shall be subject to
objection by Buyer as not being determined in accordance with GAAP (subject
to confirmation of estimates) applied on a consistent basis with
prior periods.   2.6 ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT. The adjustment amount (the
"ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT") (which may be a positive or negative number) will be
equal to (a) the Net Book Value of the Company as of the Closing Date
determined in accordance with Section 2.7 and GAAP and shall include any
employee or other bonus payments and any other liabilities to be paid by the
Company following the Closing that should have been accrued for the period
ending as of the Closing Date (including the Company\'s share of any employee
withholding, Social Security and Medicare taxes payable with respect to the
Success Bonuses and not paid by the Company before the Closing and including
the Company\'s anticipated obligation to the U.S. Army Space and Missile
Defense Command in the amount of $399,099 with respect to an anticipated task
order under the MDDC Contract, to the extent not paid or satisfied as of the

(including any Success Bonuses paid by the Company after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and any other liabilities that
have actually been paid by the Company before the Closing and shall also
exclude any Retention Payment to be paid following the Closing Date, minus
(b) the amount of $8,601,834.00. The Purchase Price shall be increased by the

number.   2.7 ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE.   (a) Sellers will prepare or cause to
be prepared unaudited consolidated financial statements ("CLOSING FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS") of the Company as of the Closing Date in   
-21-    accordance with GAAP for the period from April 1, 2005 through the
Closing Date, including a computation of Net Book Value as of the Closing
Date. The Closing Financial Statements shall be determined in accordance with
GAAP and prepared in the same manner as and consistent with the audited year-
end financial statements of the Company (except that target rates of expense
for periods after March 31, 2006 shall be used instead of actual rates of
expense for purposes of determining Net Book Value). The Closing Financial
Statements shall include any employee or other bonus payments and any other
liabilities to be paid by the Company following the Closing that should have
been accrued for the period ending as of the Closing Date, but shall exclude
any employee or other bonus payments (including any Success Bonuses paid by
the Company after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement) and any other liabilities that have actually been paid by the
Company before the Closing. The Closing Financial Statements shall further
include the Company\'s share of any employee withholding, Social Security and
Medicare taxes payable with respect to the Success Bonuses and not paid by
the Company before the Closing. The Closing Balance Sheet shall further
include as a liability the Company\'s anticipated obligation to the U.S. Army
Space and Missile Defense Command in the amount of $399,099 with respect to
an anticipated task order under the MDDC Contract, to the extent not paid or
satisfied as of the Closing Date. The Closing Financial Statements shall also
exclude any Retention Payment to be paid following the Closing Date. The
Closing Financial Statements shall also include an accrual for the fees and
expenses that the Company would have paid to the Company\'s accountants had
such accountants prepared audited financial statements for the Company for
the fiscal year ended March 31, 2006. The fees and expenses of Sellers
(including the fees and expenses of Sellers\' counsel, accountants, brokers,
investment bankers, financial advisors, representatives and other agents), to
the extent paid or to be paid by the Company as permitted hereunder, shall be
reflected either as a reduction in cash or as a liability in the Closing
Financial Statements, and no fees or expenses of Sellers shall be paid by the
Company after the Closing that are not reflected as liabilities on
the Closing Financial Statements. Sellers will deliver to Buyer within forty-
five (45) days after the Closing Date the Closing Financial Statements, it
being the understanding and agreement of the parties that Sellers and
their Representatives will be provided access to all documents and
information of the Company needed for preparation of the Closing Financial
Statements and may request that certain employees of the Company prepare and
provide assistance with respect to such Closing Financial Statements for
Sellers without any cost to Sellers, provided that such preparation of such
Closing Financial Statements does not unreasonably interfere with the day to
day activities for and on behalf of the Company of such employees requested
to prepare such Closing Financial Statements. Following delivery of the
Closing Financial Statements Sellers shall, at the request of Buyer, promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer, any and all work papers or other
documents created or used by the Company or its Representatives in the
preparation of the Closing Financial Statements. If within forty-five (45)
days following Buyer\'s receipt of the Closing Financial Statements, Buyer
has not given Sellers notice of its objection to the Closing Financial
Statements (such notice must contain a statement of the basis of Buyer\'s
objection), then the Net Book Value reflected in the Closing Financial
Statements will be used in computing the Adjustment Amount. If Buyer gives
such notice of objection and Buyer and Sellers cannot agree with regard
to such objection within fourteen (14) Business Days thereafter, then the
issues in dispute will be submitted to nationally recognized certified public
accountants mutually agreed upon by the parties (which have not been engaged
by either party or their respective subsidiaries or affiliates for at least
two (2) years prior to the date of delivery to Buyer of the   
-22-    Closing Financial Statements) (the "INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS"), for
resolution. If issues in dispute are submitted to the Independent Accountants
for resolution, (i) within fifteen (15) Business Days after request, each
party will furnish to the Independent Accountants such work papers and other
documents and information relating to the disputed issues as the Independent
Accountants may request and are available to that party (or its independent
public accountants), and each party will be afforded the opportunity to
present to and discuss with the Independent Accountants any material relating
to the dispute prior to the Independent Accountants\' determination; (ii) the
determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in a notice
delivered to Buyer and Sellers by the Independent Accountants, will be
binding and conclusive on parties in the absence of manifest error; and (iii)
the fees and disbursements of the Independent Accountants shall be allocated
between Buyer and Sellers so that Buyer\'s share of such fees and
disbursements shall be in the same proportion that the aggregate amount that
is unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer (as finally determined by the Independent
Accountants) bears to the total amount initially disputed by Buyer. The
Independent Accountants shall determine only those issues in dispute, and the
Independent Accountants\' determination shall be based upon and consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the
Independent Accountants shall be based solely on presentations with respect
to such disputed items by Buyer and Sellers to the Independent Accountants
and not on the Independent Accountants\' independent review. Buyer and
Sellers shall use their best efforts to make their respective presentations
as promptly as practicable following submission to the
Independent Accountants of the disputed items, and each such party shall be
entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to the presentation of the
other party and any questions and requests of the Independent Accountants.
Buyer and Sellers shall provide each other the same information as provided
to the Independent Accountants at the same time that the Buyer or the Sellers
provides such information to the Independent Accountants. In deciding any
matter, the Independent Accountants (i) shall be bound by the provisions of
this Section 2.7(a) and (ii) may not assign a value to any item greater than
the greatest value for such item claimed by either Buyer or Sellers or less
than the smallest value for such item claimed by Buyer or Sellers. The
Independent Accountants\' determination shall be made within forty-five (45)
days after its engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than five
(5) Business Days after the parties determine that there is a need to select
the Independent Accountants), or as soon thereafter as possible. As set forth
above, the Independent Accountants\' determination shall be set forth in a
written statement delivered to Sellers and Buyer and shall be final,
conclusive, non-appealable and binding for all purposes hereunder; provided
that such determination may be reviewed, corrected or set aside by a court of
competent jurisdiction but only if upon a finding that the Independent
Accountants failed to follow the provisions of this Agreement or made
mathematical errors with respect to its determination. The determination of
the Independent Accountants shall not be deemed an award subject to review
under the Federal Arbitration Act or any other statute.   (b) Within thirty
(30) days following the final determination of the Adjustment Amount, if the
Purchase Price (after consideration of the Adjustment Amount) is greater than
the aggregate of the payments made pursuant to Sections 2.4(b)(i) through
2.4(b)(iv), then an amount equal to the difference shall be deducted on a
dollar for dollar basis from the Buyer Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and
paid to Sellers in accordance with the provisions of the Master Escrow
Agreement, and if the Purchase Price (after consideration of the Adjustment
Amount) is less than such aggregate amount, then an amount equal to the
difference shall be deducted on a    -23-    dollar for dollar basis
from the Sellers\' Price Adjustment Escrow Amount and paid to Buyer in
accordance with the provisions of the Master Escrow Agreement. In the event
that the Buyer Price Adjustment Escrow Amount or the Sellers\'
Price Adjustment Escrow Amount, as the case may be, shall be insufficient to
reimburse the other party in accordance with the preceding sentence then
Buyer or Sellers, as the case may be, shall pay the remaining balance to the
other party in cash within such thirty (30) day period following the final
determination of the Adjustment Amount. All deductions or payments pursuant
to this Section 2.7(b) shall be made in immediately available funds together
with simple interest at a rate equal to the rate on U.S. Treasury Bills with
a maturity of three months, as reported in the Wall Street Journal for the
Closing Date, beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date of
payment. The Purchase Price shall be the Purchase Price as adjusted on a
dollar-for-dollar basis by the Adjustment Amount. Any payments or deductions
attributable to Sellers pursuant to this Section 2.7(b) shall be allocated in
the proportions set forth in Schedule II attached hereto. Any good faith
dispute in the calculation of the Adjustment Amount will not constitute a
breach of any of the representations or warranties of either Buyer or Sellers
hereunder and will not give either party any right to indemnification
hereunder.  3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLERS   Sellers and the
Company, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to Buyer as

and are accurate and complete in all material respects, and no meeting of any
such stockholders, Board of Directors, or committee has been held for which
minutes have not been    -28-    prepared and are not contained in such
minute books. At the Closing, all of those books and records will be in the
possession of the Company.   3.6 TITLE TO PROPERTIES; ENCUMBRANCES.   (a)
Section 3.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list
of all real property, leaseholds, or other interests therein currently owned
or leased by the Company. Sellers have delivered or made available to Buyer
copies of the deeds and other instruments (as recorded) by which the Company
acquired such real property and interests, and copies of all title insurance
policies, opinions, abstracts, and surveys in the possession of Sellers or
the Company and relating to such property or interests. The Company owns
(with good and marketable title in the case of real property, subject only to
the matters permitted by the following sentence) all of the properties
and assets (whether real, personal, or mixed and whether tangible or
intangible) that it purports to own located in the facilities owned or
operated by the Company or reflected as owned in the books and records of the
Company, including all of the properties and assets reflected in the
Financial Statements (except for assets held under capitalized leases
disclosed or not required to be disclosed in Section 3.6 of the Disclosure
Letter and personal property sold since the date of the Balance Sheet, as the
case may be, in the Ordinary Course of Business), all such properties and
assets are in good operating condition (reasonable wear and tear excepted)
and are suitable for their intended use, and all of the properties and assets
purchased or otherwise acquired by the Company since the date of the Balance
Sheet (except for personal property acquired and sold since the date of the
Balance Sheet in the Ordinary Course of Business and consistent with past
practice) which subsequently purchased or acquired properties and assets
(other than inventory and short-term investments) are listed in Section
3.6(a) of the Disclosure Letter. Except as set forth in Section 3.6(a) of the
Disclosure Letter, all material properties and assets reflected in the
Financial Statements are free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Permitted Encumbrances and are not, in the case of real property, subject to
any rights of way, building use restrictions, exceptions,
variances, reservations, or limitations of any nature except, with respect to
all such properties and assets, (i) mortgages or security interests shown on
the Balance Sheet as securing specified liabilities or obligations, with
respect to which no default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) exists, (ii) mortgages or security
interests incurred in connection with the purchase of property or assets
after the date of the Balance Sheet (such mortgages and security interests
being limited to the property or assets so acquired), with respect to which
no default (or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) exists, and (iii) with respect to real property, (x)
minor imperfections of title, if any, none of which is substantial in amount,
materially detracts from the value or impairs the use of the property subject
thereto, or impairs the operations of the Company, and (y) zoning laws and
other land use restrictions that do not impair the present or anticipated use
of the property subject thereto.   (b) The Company has the right to use all
customer-furnished tangible and intangible personal property and assets used
in the operation of the Company\'s business as currently conducted. Section
3.6(b) of the Disclosure Letter contains a list of all such customer-
furnished property. All customer-furnished tangible assets of the Company
are, in the aggregate, in working order, condition and repair, reasonable
wear and tear excepted, and reasonably suitable for the conduct of the
Company\'s business as currently conducted and, to the Knowledge of Sellers
and the Company, there is no material expenditure presently required to   
-29-    maintain such condition and state of repair or replace such
tangible assets. The Company is currently in possession of all customer-
furnished tangible assets provided to the Company by a customer, except such
property that has been returned to such customer or such property that is in
the possession of a qualified subcontractor. The Company will continue to
have the right to use all customer-furnished property set forth in Section
3.6(b) of the Disclosure Letter immediately following the Closing, subject to
the customer\'s right to revoke the Company\'s right to use such customer-
furnished property at any time.   3.7 CONDITION AND SUFFICIENCY OF ASSETS.
To the Company and the Sellers\' Knowledge, the buildings, plants, offices,
structures, and equipment owned or leased by the Company are structurally
sound, are in good operating condition and repair (reasonable wear and tear
excepted), and are adequate for the uses to which they are being put, and
none of such buildings, plants, offices, structures, or equipment is in need
of maintenance or repairs except for ordinary, routine maintenance and
repairs that are not material in nature or cost or for which costs have been
reserved on the Financial Statements. The building, plants, offices,
structures, and equipment of the Company are reasonably sufficient for the
continued conduct of the Company\'s businesses after the Closing in
substantially the same manner as conducted prior to the Closing.   3.8
ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. All accounts receivable of the Company that
are reflected on the Financial Statements or on the accounting records of
the Company as of the Closing Date (collectively, the "ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE") represent or will represent valid obligations arising from sales
actually made or services actually performed in the Ordinary Course of
Business. Unless paid prior to the Closing Date, the Accounts Receivable are
or will be as of the Closing Date current and collectible net of the
respective reserves shown on the Financial Statements or on the accounting
records of the Company as of the Closing Date (which reserves are adequate
and calculated consistent with past practice and, in the case of the reserve
as of the Closing Date, will not represent a material adverse change in the
composition of such Accounts Receivable in terms of aging). Subject to such
reserves, each of the Accounts Receivable either has been or will be
collected in full, without any set-off, within two hundred forty (240) days
after the day on which it first becomes due and payable. There is no contest,
claim, or right of set-off, other than returns in the Ordinary Course of
Business, under any Contract with any obligor of an Accounts Receivable
relating to the amount or validity of such Accounts Receivable. Section 3.8
of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of all
Accounts Receivable as of the date of the Balance Sheet, which list sets
forth the aging of such Accounts Receivable.   3.9 INVENTORY. All inventory
of the Company, whether or not reflected in the Financial Statements,
consists of a quality and quantity usable and salable in the Ordinary Course
of Business, except for obsolete items and items of below-standard quality,
all of which have been written off or written down to net realizable value in
the Financial Statements or on the accounting records of the Company as of
the Closing Date, as the case may be. The quantities of each item of
inventory (whether raw materials, work-in-process, or finished goods) are not
excessive, but are reasonable in the present circumstances of
the Company.   3.10 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. Except as set forth in
Section 3.10 of the Disclosure Letter, the Company has no liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether known or unknown and whether absolute,
accrued, contingent, or otherwise), except for liabilities or
obligations    -30-    reflected or reserved against in the Balance
Sheet and liabilities incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business since the
respective dates thereof.   3.11 TAXES.   (a) The Company has filed or
caused to be filed (on a timely basis since its inception) all Tax Returns
that are or were required to be filed by or with respect to the Company,
pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements. Sellers have delivered to Buyer
copies of, and Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and accurate list of, all such Tax Returns relating to income or franchise
taxes filed for the tax years since December 31, 2000. The Company has paid,
or made provision for the payment of, all Taxes that have or may have become

received by Sellers or the Company, except such Taxes, if any, as are listed
in Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter and are being contested in good
faith and as to which adequate reserves (determined in accordance with GAAP)
have been provided in the Financial Statements. No notice has been received
by the Company and, to the Knowledge of Sellers or the Company, no claim has
ever been made by a Governmental Authority in a jurisdiction where
the Company does not file Tax Returns that it may be subject to Taxes in
that jurisdiction. Except as described in Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure
Letter, the Company is not a partner in any partnership and is not a party to
any joint ventures. Except as set forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure
Letter, the Company has not requested or received any legal or accounting
opinions relating to the Company\'s position on any Tax Return. Except as set
forth in Section 3.11(a) of the Disclosure Letter, the Company has not
requested or received a revenue ruling, private letter ruling, or similar or
related correspondence from the IRS.   (b) The United States federal,
state, local, and foreign income Tax Returns of the Company subject to such
Taxes have been audited by the IRS or relevant state, local or foreign Tax
authorities or are closed by the applicable statute of limitations for all
taxable years through the Company\'s tax year ended December 31, 1999.
Section 3.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate
list of all audits of all such Tax Returns of the Company since the
Company\'s tax year ended December 31, 2000, including a reasonably detailed
description of the nature and outcome of each audit and a schedule of all
pending audits and contests of liability for Taxes. All
deficiencies proposed, assessed or determined as a result of such audits have
been paid, reserved against, settled, or, as described in Section 3.11(b) of
the Disclosure Letter, are being contested in good faith by appropriate
proceedings. Section 3.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter describes all
adjustments to the United States federal, state, local and foreign Tax
Returns filed by the Company for all taxable years since the Company\'s tax
year ended December 31, 2000, and the resulting deficiencies proposed by the
IRS and relevant state, local and foreign Tax authorities. Except as
described in Section 3.11(b) of the Disclosure Letter, neither Sellers nor
the Company have given or been requested to give waivers or extensions (or is
or would be subject to a waiver or extension given by any other Person) of
any statute of limitations relating to the payment of Taxes of the Company or
for which the Company may be liable.   (c) The charges, accruals, and
reserves with respect to Taxes on the respective books of the Company are
adequate (determined in accordance with GAAP) and are at least equal to the
Company\'s liability for Taxes. The Company has received no written notice,
and has    -31-    no Knowledge, of a proposed tax assessment against
the Company except as disclosed in the Financial Statements or in Section
3.11(c) of the Disclosure Letter. No consent to the application of Section
341(f)(2) of the IRC has been filed with respect to any property or assets
held, acquired, or to be acquired by the Company.   (d) All Taxes that the
Company is or was required by Legal Requirements to withhold or collect has
been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, has been paid to
the proper Governmental Body or other Person, including, but not limited to,
amounts paid to any employee or any foreign person or entity, and any back-up
withholding required under IRC Section 3406.   (e) All Tax Returns filed by
the Company are true, correct, and complete in all material respects. Except
as provided in Section 3.11(e) of the Disclosure Letter, there is no tax
sharing agreement, including any agreement for indemnification, that will
require any payment by the Company after the date of this Agreement,
excluding agreements the primary purpose of which is not the allocation of
Tax liabilities and in which such provisions regarding Taxes are typical of
such agreements and the amount of Tax is not material in the aggregate. For
federal income tax purposes, the Company has been a validly electing S
corporation within the meaning of IRC Sections 1361 and 1362 at all times
since April 1, 1982, and the Company will be an S corporation up to

deemed a second class of stock, issuing options, warrants or convertible
notes that would not be deemed a second class of stock, allocating income and
distributions based on a pro rata ownership basis, and maintaining only
eligible shareholders. Neither the Company nor any Seller is a party to any
Contract relating to the transfer, assignment or recontribution of any
distributions made by the Company to any Seller or the Former
Shareholder.   (f) Section 3.11(f) of the Disclosure Letter lists those
states in which the Company has made valid state tax elections to be treated
as an S corporation or comparable pass-through entity and lists those states
in which the Company is not treated as a pass-through entity for state tax
purposes.   (g) The Company will have no liability for Taxes under IRC
Section 1374 in connection with the deemed sale of the Company\'s assets
caused by the Section 338(h)(10) Election. The Company has not in the past 10
years (i) acquired assets from another corporation in a transaction in which
the Company\'s Tax basis for the acquired assets was determined, in whole or
in part, by reference to the Tax basis of the acquired assets (or any other
property) in the hands of the transferor or (ii) acquired the stock of any
corporation which is a qualified subchapter S subsidiary.   (h) The Company
is not party to any agreement, contract or arrangement that has resulted or
would result in the payment of any "excess parachute payment" within the
meaning of IRC Section 280G.   (i) The Company has not participated,
directly or indirectly, in any transaction that would constitute a reportable
transaction or listed transaction both as defined in Treas. Reg.   
-32-    1.6011-4, or in any transaction that is a tax shelter within the
meaning of IRC Section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii).   3.12 NO MATERIAL ADVERSE
CHANGE. Except as set forth in Section 3.12 of the Disclosure Letter, since
the date of the Balance Sheet, there has not been any change in the business,
operations, properties, prospects, assets, or financial condition of the
Company that would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on the Company, and to the Knowledge of the Seller or the Company, no event
has occurred or circumstance exists that would reasonably be expected to
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.   3.13 EMPLOYEE

licensee, or business relation of Company to cease doing, or decrease,

its parent is acquired (whether by sale of stock, sale of all
or substantially all of its assets or by merger) by a third party, the
obligations of such Seller hereunder shall apply only with respect to the
Competing Products and Services and shall not be deemed by operation of such
acquisition to include other products and services of such third party that
are not Competing Products and Services. Nothing herein shall limit the right
of such Seller or any other Person to publish notices for or advertisements
of available employment in newspapers, on the internet or in other
publications or media of general circulation.   (iii) No Seller will,
directly or indirectly, either for such Seller or any other Person (other

related to the Company or the business of the Company.   (d) Each Seller
will, during the Noncompete Term, within ten days after accepting any
employment, advise Buyer of the identity of any employer of such Seller.
Buyer or Company may serve notice upon each such employer that such Seller is

Section 5.12.   (e) For purposes of this Agreement, the "NONCOMPETE TERM"
shall mean, with respect to each Seller, the period commencing on the date of
this Agreement and ending five (5) years thereafter.   5.13 CONFIDENTIALITY
AGREEMENT OF SELLERS. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that all
Confidential Information regarding the Company and the Buyer known or
obtained by such Seller, whether before or after the date hereof, is the
property, as appropriate, of the Company or Buyer. Therefore, each
Seller agrees that he will not, at any time, disclose or cause to be
disclosed to any unauthorized Persons or use or cause to be used for his own
account or for the benefit of any third party (other than the Company) any
Confidential Information regarding the Company and the Buyer, whether Seller
has such information in Seller\'s memory or embodied in writing or other
physical form or any computer readable format, without Buyer\'s written
consent, unless and to the extent that disclosure is required by law (in
which event Seller shall give Buyer as much notice of such disclosure as is
practicable and permitted by law and shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain
appropriate protective orders). Each Seller agrees to deliver to Buyer at the
time of execution of this Agreement, and at any other time Buyer may request,
all documents, memoranda, notes, plans, records, reports, summaries and other
documentation, models, components, devices, or computer software, whether
embodied in a disk or in other form (and all copies of all of the foregoing),
relating to the businesses, operations, or affairs of the Company and any
other Confidential Information regarding the Company and the Buyer that
Seller may then possess or have under Seller\'s control.   5.14 REMEDIES.
Each Seller agrees that such Seller\'s violation of any of the provisions of
Sections 5.12 and 5.13 shall cause immediate and irreparable harm to Buyer
and the Company. In the event any Seller breaches or threatens to breach any
of said provisions, such Seller agrees that Buyer shall be entitled to the
entry of preliminary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief by a
court of competent jurisdiction to restrain such Seller from any violation or
threatened violation of such provisions and compelling such Seller to
comply with such provisions, it being agreed that money damages alone would
be inadequate to compensate Buyer and the Company and would be an inadequate
remedy for such breach. This Section shall not affect or limit, and the
injunctive relief provided in this Section shall be in addition to, any other
remedies available to Buyer or the Company at law or in equity or in
arbitration for any such violation by any Seller, including the right to
recover Damages as provided in Section 10.    -61-    6. COVENANTS OF
BUYER.   6.1 APPROVALS OF GOVERNMENTAL BODIES. As promptly as practicable
after the date of this Agreement, Buyer will, and will cause each of its
Related Persons to, make all filings required by Legal Requirements to be
made by them to consummate the Contemplated Transactions (including all
filings under the HSR Act). Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Buyer will, and will cause each Related Person to, cooperate
with Sellers with respect to all filings that Sellers are required by Legal
Requirements to make in connection with the Contemplated Transactions, and
cooperate with Sellers in obtaining all consents identified in Section 3.2 of
the Disclosure Letter; provided that this Agreement will not require Buyer to

other burden to obtain a Governmental Authorization.   6.2 BEST EFFORTS.

the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer will promptly notify
Sellers and the Company in writing if Buyer becomes aware of any fact or
condition that causes or constitutes a Breach of any of Buyer\'s
representations and warranties as of the date of this Agreement, or if Buyer
becomes aware of the occurrence after the date of this Agreement of any fact
or condition that would (except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement)
cause or constitute a Breach of any such representation or warranty had such
representation or warranty been made as of the time of occurrence
or discovery of such fact or condition. Should any such fact or condition
require any change in the Buyer Schedules if the Buyer Schedules were dated
the date of the occurrence or discovery of any such fact or condition, Buyer
will promptly deliver to Sellers and the Company a supplement to the Buyer
Schedules specifying such change. Between the date of this Agreement and the
Closing Date, Buyer will promptly notify Sellers and the Company of the
occurrence of any Breach of any covenant of Buyer in this Section 6 or of the
occurrence of any event that may make the satisfaction of the conditions in
Section 8 impossible or unlikely.   6.4 FURTHER ASSURANCES. Buyer shall use
Buyer\'s Best Efforts to implement the provisions of this Agreement, and for
such purpose Buyer, at the request of Sellers and at no cost to Buyer, at or
after the Closing, shall promptly execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, to Sellers such documents and other instruments in
addition to those required by this Agreement, in form and substance
satisfactory to Sellers, and take all such other actions, as Sellers may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to implement any provision of this
Agreement and/or to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and obtain
the benefit thereof for Sellers.   6.5 TAX ELECTION. The Company and each
Seller shall join with Buyer in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election and

income, gain, deduction, or loss recognized after the Closing Date shall be
included by the Company and Buyer in Buyer\'s consolidated   
-62-    federal income Tax Return (and to the extent applicable, in
Buyer\'s Tax Return for state and local tax purposes as well). Buyer
covenants that it will not and will not cause or permit the Company or any
Affiliated Entity, Subsidiary or any affiliate of Buyer to take any action on
the Closing Date (i) other than in the Ordinary Course of Business,
including, without limitation, the distribution of any dividend or the
effectuation of any redemption, that could give rise to any Tax liability or
reduce any Tax Asset of the Company, any Affiliated Entity, Subsidiary or
Sellers, or give rise to any loss of Sellers, (ii) to make any election or
deemed election under IRC Section 338 other than the Section 338(h)(10)
Election, or (iii) to make (other than the Section 338(h)(10) Election) or

in any Tax liability or any reduction of any Tax asset of the Company, any
Affiliated Entity, Subsidiary or Sellers.   6.6 DIRECTOR AND OFFICER

shall cause, for a period of six (6) years after the Closing, all rights to

of the Disclosure Letter ("INDEMNIFIED EMPLOYEES") as provided for in the
Company\'s Organizational Documents as of the date hereof to continue
(without amendment or modification in any way unless required by law or
regulation) in full force. Subject to the foregoing, Buyer may, from
and after the Closing, cause the Company to merge, dissolve or
reorganize.   (b) At or prior to the Closing, the Company will obtain a
commitment from Federal Insurance Company for continuation, for a period of
six (6) years after the Closing, of the Company\'s (i) fiduciary liability
insurance, (ii) directors and officers liability insurance and (iii)
employment practices insurance, in each case, with coverage for claims based
on activities prior to the Closing and the premiums for such coverage shall
be paid in full by the Company at or prior to Closing with such payment to be
reflected either as a reduction in cash or as a liability in the Closing
Financial Statements.   (c) This Section 6.6 shall be binding on all
successors and assigns of the Company and Buyer. In the event that Buyer or
the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
such successors and assigns shall assume all obligations set forth in this
Section 6.6. The provisions of this Section 6.6 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Employee, his or
her heirs, and his or her representatives or assigns.   6.7 CONFIDENTIALITY

Persons or use or cause to be used for its own account or for the   
-63-    benefit of any third party any Confidential Information regarding
the Sellers, whether Buyer has such information in Buyer\'s memory or
embodied in writing or other physical form or any computer readable format,
without each applicable Seller\'s written consent, unless and to the extent
that disclosure is required by law (in which event Buyer shall give such
Seller as much notice of such disclosure as is practicable and permitted by
law and shall cooperate with Buyer to obtain appropriate protective orders).
Buyer agrees to deliver to each Seller at the time of execution of this
Agreement, and at any other time such Seller may request, all documents,

Seller and any other Confidential Information relating to such Seller that
Buyer may then possess or have under Buyer\'s control.   6.8 ACCOUNTS

of income or expense, and all parties hereto agree to prepare their tax
returns consistent therewith. Any payment made by Buyer to a Seller pursuant
to this Section 10 shall be deemed, to the extent permitted by applicable
law, to be an increase in the Purchase Price and shall not be deemed to be an
item of income or expense, and all parties hereto agree to prepare their tax

the supplements to the Disclosure Letter, or any other certificate or
document delivered by Sellers pursuant to this Agreement;   (ii) any Breach
of any representation or warranty made by Sellers in this Agreement as if
such representation or warranty were made on and as of the Closing Date

the Company;   (viii) any claim that, at the time of the consummation of
the Contemplated Transactions, any Person other than Sellers owns or holds,
or has any right, title or interest in or to, any equity securities of the
Company;   (ix) any decision by the U.S. Government or any

the U.S. Government or any other Governmental Body to impose money damages on
or seek refunds from the Company or Buyer which directly results from the

of the MDDC Contract prior to Closing;   (x) any failure by the Company to
obtain any future Contract with the U.S. Government or any other Governmental
Body within two (2) years of the Closing which is predominantly the result of
the Company\'s failure to perform or comply with any of the terms and
provisions of the MDDC Contract prior to Closing or any unsatisfactory
performance assessment or rating issued to the Company in connection with the
MDDC Contract for acts or omissions of Company which occurred prior to
Closing; provided that Buyer shall have the burden of proof as to whether the
Company\'s failure to perform or comply with any of the terms and provisions
of the MDDC Contract or any unsatisfactory performance assessment or rating
issued to the Company thereunder is the predominant factor in any decision by
the U.S. Government or any other Governmental Body to not award the Company
such future Contract with the U.S. Government or any other Governmental Body;
or    -72-     (xi) any Proceeding arising out of or related to any
alleged discrimination based on sex, retaliation or disability or for
defamation and referenced in Section 3.21(2) of the Disclosure Letter,
without any application of the Basket, but subject to the Cap.   (xii) any
claim by any Person against the Company which is asserted within two (2)

breach of the Pelorus Software Agreement by the Company after the Closing or
claims relating to modifications of the Pelorus Software by or with the
consent of the Company after the Closing.   (b) In the event this Agreement
is terminated by Buyer pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or (c)(i) of the Agreement,
Sellers and the Company, jointly and severally, will indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and pay to Buyer the amount of any Damages arising, directly
or indirectly, from or in connection with (i) any intentional or willful
Breach of any representation or warranty made by Sellers or the Company in

understanding alleged to have been made by such Person with Sellers or the

incurred, or manifested itself), personal injury, property damage (including
trespass, nuisance, wrongful eviction, and deprivation of the use of

employee or former employee of Sellers or the Company or any other Person for
whose conduct they are or may be held responsible, in any way arising from
any Hazardous Activity conducted with respect to the Facilities or the

Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.11, 3.13, 3.19, 3.20, 3.21, 3.24 and 3.26
unless on or before eighteen (18) months from the Closing Date Buyer notifies
Sellers of a claim specifying the factual basis of that claim in reasonable
detail to the extent then known by Buyer. A claim with respect to Sections
3.11, 3.13, 3.19, 3.20 and 3.21 may be made at any time prior to the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including extensions
thereof as a result of timely filed waivers). A claim with respect
to Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6, 3.24, and 3.26 or a claim for indemnification
or reimbursement not based upon any representation or warranty of Sellers or
any covenant or obligation of Sellers to be performed and complied with prior
to the Closing Date may be made at any time.   (b) If the Closing occurs,
Buyer will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect
to any representation or warranty, or covenant or obligation to be performed
and complied with prior to the Closing Date, unless on or before eighteen
(18) months from the Closing Date Sellers notify Buyer of a claim specifying
the factual basis of that claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known
by Sellers.   (c) The representations, warranties and covenants of the
Company shall not survive the Closing, and the Company will have no liability
(for indemnification, contribution or otherwise) thereafter with respect to
any representation or warranty or any covenant or obligation to be performed
and complied with prior to the Closing Date. Effective upon the Closing,
Sellers shall waive any and all rights to indemnification or contribution
from the Company and release the Company from any and all claims based on
indemnification or contribution with respect any claim for Damages by any
Indemnified Person arising, directly or indirectly, from or in   
-75-    connection with (a) any Breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by
Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, (b) any Breach by the Company of any
covenant or obligation of the Company in this Agreement or in any certificate
delivered by the Company pursuant to this Agreement, (c) any product shipped
or manufactured by, or any services provided by, the Company prior to the
Closing Date or (d) any claim by any Person for brokerage or finder\'s fees
or commissions or similar payments based upon any agreement or understanding
alleged to have been made by such Person with the Company (or any Person
acting on its behalf).   10.6 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNTS - SELLERS. Sellers will
have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the
matters described in Sections 10.2 and 10.3 until the total of all Damages
for which an indemnification payment is required by Sellers exceeds $500,000
(the "BASKET"), and then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed the
Basket; provided that, the Basket shall not apply to Damages arising under
Section 3.3, Section 10.2(a)(vi), Section 10.2(a)(ix), Section 10.2(a)(x) or
with respect to fraud by the Sellers (or the Company if the Closing does not
occur). The aggregate liability of Sellers with regard to matters described
in Sections 10.2 and 10.3 shall not exceed $40,000,000 (the "CAP"); provided
that, (a) the Cap shall not apply to Damages arising under Section 3.3,
Section 10.2(a)(vi) or with respect to fraud by the Sellers (or the Company
if the Closing does not occur), (b) there shall be a special additional Cap
of $40,000,000 (the "SPECIAL CAP") with respect to Damages arising under
Section 10.2(a)(ix) and Section 10.2(a)(x) and (c) in no event shall the
aggregate liability of Sellers with regard to matters covered by the Cap and
the Special Cap exceed $60,000,000 (the "OVERALL CAP"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 10.6 will not apply to any Breach of Sellers\'
representations and warranties of which any Seller had Knowledge at the date
on which such representation and warranty is made or any intentional
Breach by any Seller of any covenant or obligation of the Sellers under this
Agreement and Sellers will be jointly and severally liable for all Damages
with respect to such Breaches.   10.7 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT -- BUYER. Buyer
will have no liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect to the
matters described in Section 10.4 until the total of all Damages with respect
to such matters exceeds the Basket, and then only for the amount by which
such Damages exceed the Basket, provided that the aggregate liability of
Buyer with regard to such matters shall not exceed the Cap. However, this
Section 10.7 will not apply to any Breach of Buyer\'s representations and
warranties of which Buyer had Knowledge at the date on which such
representation and warranty is made or any intentional Breach by Buyer of any
covenant or obligation of the Buyer under this Agreement, and Buyer will be
liable for all Damages with respect to such Breaches.   10.8 ESCROW. Buyer
may assert a claim for indemnification under the Master Escrow Agreement, by
notice to Sellers\' Representative and the Master Escrow Agent specifying in
reasonable detail the basis for such claim to the extent then known by Buyer
and the amount to which Buyer is entitled under this Section 10, all as more
fully provided in the Master Escrow Agreement. Buyer is authorized to recover
from the Master Escrow Amount the entire amount of, or any portion of, any
claim against any Seller without regard to the amount contributed or deemed
to be contributed by such Seller. Sellers will settle among themselves any
right to contribution or indemnity with regard to amounts paid to Buyer from
the escrowed funds. The amount held in escrow, if and when disbursed to
Sellers, shall be treated on an installment sale    -76-    basis and
shall be taken into income by Sellers in the year in which it is received.
Neither the giving of notice of a claim under the Master Escrow Agreement nor
the failure to give such notice will constitute an election of remedies or
limit Buyer in any manner in the enforcement of any other remedies that may
be available to it.   10.9 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION - THIRD PARTY
CLAIMS.   (a) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under Section
10.2, 10.4, or 10.3 of notice of the commencement of any Proceeding against
it, such indemnified party will, if a claim is to be made against an
indemnifying party under such Section, give notice to the indemnifying party
of the commencement of such claim, but the failure to notify the indemnifying
party will not relieve the indemnified party of any liability that it may
have to any indemnified party, except to the extent that the indemnifying
party demonstrates that the defense of such action is prejudiced by the
indemnified party\'s failure to give such notice.   (b) If any Proceeding
referred to in Section 10.9(a) is brought against an indemnified party and it
gives notice to the indemnifying party of the commencement of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying party will, unless the claim involves Taxes, be
entitled to participate in such Proceeding and, to the extent that it wishes
(unless (i) the indemnifying party is also a party to such Proceeding and the
indemnified party determines in good faith that joint representation would be
inappropriate, or (ii) the indemnifying party fails to provide reasonable
assurance to the indemnified party of its financial capacity to defend such
Proceeding and provide indemnification with respect to such Proceeding), to
assume the defense of such Proceeding with counsel satisfactory to the
indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to
the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying party will not, as long as it diligently
conducts such defense, be liable to the indemnified party under this Section
10 for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such Proceeding, in each case subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense of such Proceeding, other
than reasonable costs of investigation. If the indemnifying party assumes the
defense of a Proceeding, (i) it will be conclusively established for purposes
of this Agreement that the claims made in that Proceeding are within the
scope of and subject to indemnification; (ii) no compromise or settlement of
such claims may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified
party\'s consent unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation
of Legal Requirements or any violation of the rights of any Person and no
effect on any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party,
and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by
the indemnifying party; and (iii) the indemnified party will have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such
claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an indemnifying
party of the commencement of any Proceeding and the indemnifying party does
not, within ten days after the indemnified party\'s notice is given, give
notice to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of such
Proceeding, the indemnifying party will be bound by any determination made in
such Proceeding or any compromise or settlement effected by the indemnified
party.   (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party
determines in good faith that there is a reasonable probability that a
Proceeding may adversely affect it or its affiliates other than as a result
of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to   
-77-    indemnification under this Agreement, the indemnified party may,
by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to defend,
compromise, or settle such Proceeding, but the indemnifying party will not be
bound by any determination of a Proceeding so defended or any compromise or
settlement effected without its consent (which may not be unreasonably
withheld).   (d) Sellers hereby consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of
any court in which a Proceeding is brought against any Indemnified Person
for purposes of any claim that an Indemnified Person may have under this
Agreement with respect to such Proceeding or the matters alleged therein, and
agree that process may be served on Sellers with respect to such a claim
anywhere in the world.   10.10 PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION - OTHER
CLAIMS. A claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a third-
party claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification
is sought.   10.11 NOTICE TO SELLERS. Any notice to Sellers pursuant to this
Section 10 shall be sent to the attention of the Sellers\' Representative,
and notice sent to the Sellers\' Representative shall be deemed sufficient
notice to all Sellers under this Section 10.   10.12 TAX INDEMNIFICATION;
TAX BENEFIT.   (a) Indemnification for Direct Taxes. Notwithstanding any
other provision contained in this Agreement to the contrary, Sellers, jointly
and severally, shall indemnify the EDO Group, Buyer and the Company (each a
"BUYER TAX INDEMNITEE") for, and shall defend and hold each such Buyer Tax
Indemnitee harmless from, the full amount of any Taxes assessed against or
collected from each such Buyer Tax Indemnitee and any other Adverse
Consequences arising therefrom for all taxable periods ending on or before
the Closing Date, and the portion through the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Taxes assessed
or collected (i) as a result of Company\'s failure to properly make a valid S
corporation election or to maintain eligibility for S corporation status
within the meaning of IRC Sections 1361 and 1362, (ii) as a result of
Company\'s failure to properly make a valid election to be treated as an S
corporation or achieve comparable pass-through tax treatment under any state
or local tax statute, or to maintain eligibility for such S corporation or
comparable pass-through tax treatment, (iii) any failure on the part of
Seller described in Section 5.11, pertaining to the making of a
Section 338(h)(10) Election, (iv) as a result of the Company\'s failure to
pay, collect or withhold Taxes (each of (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) a
"DEFECTIVE ELECTION EVENT"), (v) any and all Taxes of any person (other than
the Company) imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract
or pursuant to any law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event
or transaction occurring before the Closing, or (vi) any and all Taxes of the
Company for any period for which an S corporation election was not in effect,
or with respect to Taxes other than federal income taxes, for any period or
for any jurisdiction in which pass-through treatment similar to S corporation
treatment did not apply to the Company.   (b) Indemnification for other Tax
Loss. If for purposes of any Taxes, any Buyer Tax Indemnitee shall lose the
benefit of, or shall not have, or shall not claim, or shall lose the   
-78-    right to claim, or shall suffer a deferral, reduction or
disallowance of, or shall be required to apply or recapture all or any
portion of any amount (including the loss of an increase in basis of any
asset of the Company as a result of a failure to be able to make an effective
Section 338(h)(10) Election) that could otherwise give rise to a deduction or
other reduction of tax were the Buyer Tax Indemnitee to have income
sufficient to use such Tax benefit at any time (any such loss, deferral,
reduction, disallowance, application or recapture hereinafter called a "BUYER
TAX LOSS"), and such Buyer Tax Loss is suffered as a result of a Defective
Election Event, then, without limiting the generality of any indemnification
required under Section 10.2, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall be
obligated to pay to the Buyer Tax Indemnitee an amount in respect of such
Buyer Tax Loss (each a "BUYER TAX INDEMNITY PAYMENT") equal to an
amount which shall provide the Buyer Tax Indemnitee with an amount equal to
the excess of (A) all Tax, interest, penalties and additions to tax incurred
for federal, state and local income tax purposes, over (B) the amount of all
Tax, interest, penalties and additions to tax that would have been incurred
for federal, state and local income tax purposes but for the loss of such Tax
attribute, in each case assuming the Buyer Tax Indemnitee is subject to the
highest marginal combined federal, state and local income tax rate which
could be applicable to such Buyer Tax Indemnitee.   (c) Calculation and
Payment. The amount of any Buyer Tax Indemnity Payments under this Section
10.12 shall be calculated by the Buyer and such calculation shall be provided
to the Sellers. If Sellers object to the calculation, they as the Objecting
Party shall promptly notify Buyer of a request for the Tax Objection Process,
which shall govern the obligation.   (d) Indemnification for Direct Taxes.
Notwithstanding any other provision contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, Buyer and Company, jointly and severally, shall indemnify Sellers
(each a "SELLER TAX INDEMNITEE") for, and shall defend and hold each such
Seller Tax Indemnitee harmless from, the full amount of any Taxes assessed
against or collected from each such Seller Tax Indemnitee and any other
Adverse Consequences arising therefrom for all taxable periods ending after
the Closing Date, and the portion after the end of the Closing Date for any
taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date
including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Taxes assessed
or collected as a result of any and all Taxes of any person imposed on any
Seller as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
law, rule, or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction
occurring after the Closing.   (e) Calculation and Payment. The amount of
any Seller Tax Indemnity payments under this Section 10.12 shall be
calculated by the Seller and such calculation shall be provided to the Buyer.
If Buyer objects to the calculation, it as the Objecting Party shall promptly
notify Seller of a request for the Tax Objection Process, which shall govern
the obligation.   10.13 SUBROGATION. Upon making an indemnity payment
pursuant to this Agreement, the indemnifying party will, to the extent of
such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the indemnified party against
any third party in respect of the damages to which the payment related.  
10.14 NO DOUBLE RECOVERY. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under
any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent such party or
its affiliate has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any
other provision of this Agreement, the Exhibits, the Disclosure Letter or
the    -79-    Schedules attached hereto, or any document executed in
connection with this Agreement or otherwise.   10.15 TREATMENT OF INDEMNITY
PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. Unless otherwise required by applicable Law,
all indemnification payments shall constitute adjustments to the Purchase
Price for all Tax purposes, and no party shall take any position inconsistent
with such characterization.   10.16 EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES. The remedies
provided for in this Agreement shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of
the parties and their respective officers, directors, employees, affiliates,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns for any breach of or
inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered at Closing; provided, however, that
nothing herein is intended to waive any claims for fraud or waive any
equitable remedies to which a party may be entitled.   10.17 USE OF
INSURANCE. In the event any Damages related to a claim by Buyer under this
Agreement are covered by insurance, Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts (which shall not include the commencement of litigation)
to seek recovery under such insurance and the amount of Damages incurred by
Buyer for purposes of this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount Buyer
recovers from any insurer (net of any costs of collecting such
insurance payment, including the amount of any co-payment or deductible and
less that portion of any premium increase in the next policy period of the
applicable insurance policy or replacement insurance policy that results
directly from the assertion of such claim, as determined by correspondence
from the insurance carrier or insurance broker to Buyer, a copy which shall
have been provided to the Sellers) and Buyer shall refund amounts received
from the Sellers up to the amount of indemnification actually received for
any such Damages; provided that the filing of a claim with any insurer for
such Damages shall not delay (or prior to receipt of an amount from an
insurer, reduce) any payment due to Buyer under this Section 10.   10.18
MITIGATION. Each party agrees to use reasonable efforts to mitigate any loss,
liability or damage which forms the basis of a claim hereunder.  11. GENERAL
PROVISIONS.   11.1 PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION. Buyer, the Company and Sellers
agree that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Company will be
allocated to the assets of the Company for all purposes (including Tax and
financial accounting) pursuant to the valuation report prepared by an
independent third party appraiser to be engaged by Buyer for such purpose
following the Closing, as adjusted by the Buyer in a manner consistent with
IRC Sections 338 and 1060 and the regulations thereunder. If Sellers object
to the allocation so determined, they as the Objecting Party shall promptly
notify Buyer of a request for the Tax Objection Process. Buyer, the Company
and Sellers shall file all Tax Returns and information reports, including
without limitation IRS Form 8883, in a manner consistent with the allocation
determined under this Section 11.1. Sellers shall have no liability for any
adjustments to any tax returns of Buyer or the Company attributable solely to
a change in the allocation determined under this Section 11.1.   
-80-     11.2 TAX RETURNS. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared, on
a basis consistent with the Company\'s past practice and custom, unless
Sellers approve otherwise, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the
Company for all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed
after the Closing Date, except for the Company\'s Federal S Corporation Tax
Returns and corresponding state, local and foreign Tax Returns required to be
filed for all periods prior to Closing and the period ending with the Closing
(including the Federal S Corporation Tax Return and corresponding state,
local and foreign Tax Returns required to be filed due to the deemed asset
sale under IRC Section 338(h)(10)), which shall be prepared by Sellers and
approved by Buyer prior to filing, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Sellers shall provide Buyer with a schedule
of all Tax Returns of the Company to be filed for periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date, and a list of Tax Returns for which extensions have been
filed. Sellers shall complete returns required hereunder not later than
forty-five (45) days prior to the due date therefore and provide them to
Buyer for prompt review to permit timely filing.   11.3 COOPERATION ON TAX
MATTERS.   (a) Buyer, the Company and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and
to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with
the filing of Tax Returns and Tax refunds and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes; provided, that Sellers shall not
file, or cause to be filed, the Company\'s Federal S corporation Tax Returns
and corresponding state, local and foreign Tax Returns of the Company
required to be filed for all periods prior to Closing and the period ending
with the Closing (including the Federal S Corporation Tax Return and
corresponding state, local and foreign Tax Returns required to be filed due
to the deemed asset sale under IRC Section 338(h)(10)), without Buyer\'s
prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided further, that Sellers shall provide Buyer
any of the aforementioned Tax Returns to Buyer not less than forty-five (45)
days prior to the due date (including properly filed extensions) for filing
such Tax Returns. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other party\'s request) the provision of records and information reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation, or other proceeding and making
employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional
information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. Buyer, the
Company and Sellers agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to
Tax matters pertinent to the Company relating to any taxable period beginning
before the Closing until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
to the extent notified by Buyer or Sellers, any extensions thereof) of the
respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements
entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party
reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any
such books and records and, if the other party so requests, the Company
or Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
possession of such books and records.   (b) Buyer and Sellers further
agree, upon request, to use reasonable good faith efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that
could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby), provided that any costs and expenses incurred in connection with
such effort shall be paid by the requesting party.    -81-     (c) The
Company, Buyer, and Sellers agree that should any Governmental Body
determine, find, hold, or propose to determine, find or hold that
the Company\'s status as an S corporation, as defined in Section 1361 of the
IRC, has at any time been terminated as a result of an inadvertent invalid
election or inadvertent termination, each as defined in Section 1362(f) of
the IRC, then the Company, Buyer, and Sellers shall take such steps as are
necessary or advisable to obtain a waiver of the effects of such a
termination (a "WAIVER"), including but not limited to the filing of a ruling
request with the IRS, and agreeing to such terms and conditions as the IRS
may impose as a condition of granting a Waiver. Sellers shall bear all costs
associated with obtaining a Waiver, including but not limited to any fee
imposed by the IRS associated with the filing of a ruling request or the
obtaining of a ruling.   (d) Except in connection with an audit resolved
pursuant to Section 11.3(e) (including consistent correlative adjustments to
Tax Returns for non-audited taxable periods), no party may amend a Tax Return
filed by any party with respect to the Company or any Affiliated Entity or
Subsidiary or file or amend any Tax election of the Company or any Affiliated
Entity, in each case, for a taxable period beginning prior to the Closing
Date, without the consent of the other parties hereto, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. The EDO Group shall, upon request by Sellers and at the
sole expense of Sellers, cooperate in the preparation of and submission to
the proper Governmental Body of any amended Tax Return that is required to
cause such Tax Return to be consistent with adjustments to the Tax Returns of
the Company or any Affiliated Entity for any other taxable period proposed by
any Governmental Body, or to give effect to an allowable loss carryback or
carryover from a taxable period of the Company or any Affiliated Entity or
Subsidiary ending on or before the Closing Date.   (e) Any party who
receives any notice of a pending or threatened Tax audit, assessment, or
adjustment relating to the Company, or any Affiliated Entity or Sellers with
respect to the Company or any Affiliated Entity, which may give rise to
liability of another party hereto, shall promptly notify Buyer and Sellers
within ten (10) Business Days of the receipt of such notice. The parties each
agree to consult with and to keep the other parties hereto informed on a
regular basis regarding the status of any Tax audit or proceeding to
the extent that such audit or proceeding could affect a liability of such
other parties (including indemnity obligations hereunder). Sellers shall have
the right to represent the interest of the Company or any Affiliated Entity
or Subsidiary in any Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding and
to employ counsel of Seller\'s choice, but reasonably satisfactory to Buyer,
at the expense of Sellers, but only to the extent such audit or other
proceeding pertains solely to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, with no preclusive effect after the Closing Date in respect of any
position taken by the EDO Group. Buyer shall have the right to participate in
such proceeding at its own expense, and shall be entitled to control the
disposition of any issue involved in such proceeding that does not affect a
potential liability of Sellers. Buyer and Sellers shall be entitled to
represent their own interests in light of their responsibilities (including
indemnity obligations) for the related Taxes, at their own expense, in any
audit or administrative or judicial proceedings involving a taxable period
that includes but does not end on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) Sellers shall not agree to any settlement for any taxable
period that would effect Tax liabilities of Buyer or the Company or any
Affiliated Entity or Subsidiary for any taxable period beginning on or after
the Closing Date without prior written consent of Buyer and (ii) neither the
Company nor Buyer shall agree to any settlement for any taxable period that
would effect Tax liabilities of Sellers or the Company or any Affiliated
Entity or Subsidiary for    -82-    any taxable period beginning on or
before the Closing Date without prior written consent of Sellers. Nothing in
this Section 11.3 shall be interpreted to diminish in any fashion the
liability of Sellers, if any, under Section 10.12.   11.4 EXPENSES. Except
as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, each party to this
Agreement will bear its respective expenses incurred in connection with the
preparation, execution, and performance of this Agreement and the
Contemplated Transactions, including all fees and expenses related to the
preparation of any filings under the HSR Act and of such party\'s
agents, representatives, legal counsel, and accountants; provided, however,
that Buyer shall pay all filing fees related to compliance with the HSR Act
in connection with transactions contemplated hereby. At the Closing, Sellers
will cause the Company not to have any liability for out-of-pocket expenses
in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions except as
reflected in the Closing Financial Statements. In the event of termination of
this Agreement, the obligation of each party to pay its own expenses will be
subject to any rights of such party arising from a breach of this Agreement
by another party. All estate, gift, transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges
and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred in
connection with the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions shall be
borne by Sellers to the extent Sellers are liable for such Taxes, fees and
charges, and borne by Buyer to the extent that Buyer is liable for such
Taxes, fees and charges.   11.5 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. Any public
announcement or similar publicity with respect to this Agreement or the
Contemplated Transactions will be issued, if at all, at such time and in such
manner as Buyer determines; provided that Buyer, except as may be otherwise
required by applicable Legal Requirements, shall consult with the Sellers\'
Representative with respect to the content of any such public announcement.
Unless consented to by Buyer in advance or required by Legal Requirements
except to the extent already disclosed by Buyer, prior to the Closing Sellers
shall, and shall cause the Company to, keep this Agreement strictly
confidential and may not make any disclosure of this Agreement to any Person.
Sellers and Buyer will consult with each other concerning the means by which
the Company employees, customers, and suppliers and others having dealings
with the Company will be informed of the Contemplated Transactions, and Buyer
will have the right to be present for any such communication. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Buyer shall have the right to make such disclosure as it deems
necessary or advisable under the Federal securities laws, in which event
Buyer shall provide Sellers with a copy of such disclosure.   11.6
CONFIDENTIALITY. If the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated, each
party will return or destroy as much of such written Confidential Information
as the other party may reasonably request. Whether or not the Closing takes
place, Sellers waive, and will upon Buyer\'s request cause the Company to
waive, any cause of action, right, or claim arising out of the access of
Buyer or its representatives to any Confidential Information of the
Company except for the intentional competitive misuse by Buyer of such
Confidential information.   11.7 NOTICES. All notices, consents, waivers,
and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be
deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written
confirmation of receipt), (b) sent by facsimile (with written confirmation of
receipt), provided that a copy is mailed by registered mail, return receipt
requested within one (1)    -83-    Business Day thereafter, or (c)
received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight
delivery service (receipt requested), in each case to the appropriate
addresses and facsimile numbers set forth in Schedule IV attached hereto (or
to such other addresses and facsimile numbers as a party may designate by
notice to the other parties); provided, that any notice which is being given
to Sellers shall be sent to the attention of the Sellers\' Representative,
and any notice sent to the Sellers\' Representative shall be deemed notice to
all Sellers; and provided, further, that if a party refuses to accept
delivery, such notice, consent, waiver or other communication shall be deemed
to have been given on the date of such refusal of delivery.   11.8
JURISDICTION; SERVICE OF PROCESS. Any action or proceeding seeking to enforce
any provision of, or based on any right arising out of, this Agreement shall
be brought solely and exclusively against any of the parties in the courts of
the State of New York, County of New York, or, if it has or can
acquire jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, and each of the parties consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts) in any such action or
proceeding and waives any objection to venue laid therein. Process in any
action or proceeding referred to in the preceding sentence may be served on
any party anywhere in the world.   11.9 FURTHER ASSURANCES. The parties
agree (a) to furnish upon request to each other such further information, (b)
to execute and deliver to each other such other documents, and (c) to do such
other acts and things, all as any other party may reasonably request for the
purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the documents
referred to in this Agreement.   11.10 WAIVER. The rights and remedies of
the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. Neither the
failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right, power, or
privilege under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement
will operate as a waiver of such right, power, or privilege, and no single or
partial exercise of any such right, power, or privilege will preclude any
other or further exercise of such right, power, or privilege or the exercise
of any other right, power, or privilege. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out of this Agreement or the
documents referred to in this Agreement can be discharged by one party, in
whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation of the claim or right unless in
writing signed by the other party; (b) no waiver that may be given by a party
will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and
(c) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any
obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or
demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this
Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement.   11.11 ENTIRE
AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements
between the parties with respect to its subject matter (including the Letter
of Intent between Buyer and Sellers dated December 30, 2005) and constitutes
(along with the documents referred to in this Agreement) a complete and
exclusive statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with
respect to its subject matter. This Agreement may not be amended except by a
written agreement executed by each party to this Agreement.    -84-    
11.12 SELLERS\' REPRESENTATIVE.   (a) Each Seller irrevocably appoints WHS
and FHC (together, the "SELLERS\' REPRESENTATIVE") as his, her or its agent,
proxy and attorney-in-fact for all purposes under this Agreement, and each
Seller authorizes the Sellers\' Representative to do any and all of the
following for the Seller and in the Seller\'s name and stead: (i) to execute,
acknowledge, as appropriate, and deliver to Buyer any certificate, document
or agreement referred to herein or contemplated hereby, including this
Agreement, the Shares, and the Sellers\' Closing Documents; (ii) to accept,
receipt for and deposit any funds or other amounts owing to the Seller

presentation to or discussions with the Independent Accountants with respect
thereto; (iv) to execute, acknowledge, as appropriate, and deliver such
modifications and amendments to this Agreement or any Exhibit, Schedule
or other attachment hereto or Sellers\' Closing Documents as the
Sellers\' Representative shall deem advisable in his discretion; and (v) to

Sellers\' Representative shall deem advisable in his discretion. For so long
as WHS and FHC are acting jointly as the Sellers\' Representative hereunder,
any action to be taken by the Sellers\' Representative pursuant to this
Section 11.12(a) shall require their unanimous consent. The agency created
hereby shall be deemed irrevocable and coupled with an interest; Buyer shall
be entitled to rely upon the powers granted herein with respect to any matter
relating to this Agreement; and any question which may arise concerning the
power or authority of the Sellers\' Representative to act for each Seller
shall be interpreted and construed in favor of the authority of the Sellers\'
Representative. Each Seller appointing the Sellers\' Representative hereby
ratifies and confirms all that the Sellers\' Representative shall do or cause
to be done by virtue of such Sellers\' Representative\'s appointment as
Sellers\' Representative of such Seller.   (b) Upon the resignation, death,
disability or other inability of either of the initial Sellers\'
Representatives to act, then the remaining Sellers\' Representative alone
shall be deemed the "Sellers\' Representative" hereunder and shall have all
of the rights, duties, power and authority set forth in this Section. If at
any time neither of the initial Sellers\' Representatives is ready, willing
and able to act in such capacity, then James C. Snellgrove shall be deemed
the successor Sellers\' Representative hereunder and shall have all of the
rights, duties, power and authority of the Sellers\' Representative set forth
in this Section.   (c) The Sellers\' Representative shall act for Sellers
appointing the Sellers\' Representative on all of the matters set forth in
this Agreement in the manner the Sellers\' Representative believes to be in
the best interest of such Sellers, but the Sellers\' Representative shall not
be responsible to any such Sellers for any loss or damage any such Sellers
may suffer by reason of the performance by the Sellers\' Representative of
such Sellers\' Representative\'s duties under this Agreement, other than loss
or damage arising from willful misconduct in the performance of such
Sellers\' Representative\'s duties under this Agreement.   11.13 DISCLOSURE

any Supplement thereto, must relate only to the representations and
warranties in (i) the Section of the Agreement to    -85-    which
they expressly relate and (ii) each Section of the Agreement expressly cross
referenced and not to any other representation or warranty in
this Agreement.   (b) In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Disclosure Letter,
the Buyer Schedules and any supplements thereto (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Letter, the Buyer Schedules and
any supplements thereto with respect to a specifically identified
representation or warranty), the statements in the body of this Agreement
will control.   11.14 ASSIGNMENTS, SUCCESSORS, AND NO THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. No
party may assign any of its rights under this Agreement without the prior
consent of the other parties except that Buyer may assign any of its rights
under this Agreement to any Related Person of Buyer. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and
inure to the benefit of the successors, heirs, legal representatives and
permitted assigns of the parties. If Buyer assigns its rights hereunder to
any Related Person of Buyer without the prior written consent of the other
parties, then Buyer shall remain liable to the other parties for the
obligations of Buyer hereunder. Nothing expressed or referred to in this
Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this
Agreement, the Indemnified Persons and any Tax Indemnitee any legal or
equitable right, remedy, or claim under or with respect to this Agreement or
any provision of this Agreement. This Agreement and all of its provisions and
conditions are for the sole and exclusive benefit of the parties to this
Agreement and their successors, heirs, legal representatives and permitted
