Estimate_ ") and the resulting Working  Capital Overage or Working Capital
Underage, as the case may be, certifying  that  the estimate has been
prepared in accordance with the requirements of this  Article I and that the
line items of the Working Capital Estimate have been  calculated in the same
manner, using the same methods, as the corresponding  line  item of the
Working Capital Amount set forth on _Exhibit F_ hereto was  calculated
(except as otherwise provided in _Exhibit F_ hereto),  whether or not doing
so is in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles in the
United States of America (" _GAAP_ "). The  foregoing principles are referred
to in this Agreement as the " _Working  Capital Principles_ ".

 

 

SECTION  1.02. _Transfer  of the Excluded Assets; Excluded Liabilities;
Consents of Third  Parties._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the 
conditions set forth in this Agreement, immediately prior to the Closing, 
the  Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries (including the
Transferred  Entities) to make, at the expense and risk of the Seller, such
contributions,  transfers, assignments and acceptances in form and substance
reasonably  acceptable to the parties, such that, upon the consummation of
such  contributions, transfers, assignments and acceptances, the Seller or
its  designees shall own the Excluded Assets and shall be responsible for
the  Excluded Liabilities, without further recourse to any Transferred
Entity,  the  Purchaser or its other affiliates. In furtherance of the
foregoing,  (i) the Seller shall retain, and neither the Purchaser nor any
Transferred  Entity shall acquire, and no Transferred Entity shall retain,
any interest  in  the Excluded Assets and (ii) the Seller shall retain, and
neither the  Purchaser nor any Transferred Entity shall assume, and no
Transferred Entity  shall retain, any Excluded Liability.

 

 

(b) Notwithstanding  any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
no asset, claim, right  or  benefit the assignment or transfer of which is
otherwise contemplated by  this  Agreement shall be assigned or transferred
if such assignment or transfer  (or  attempt to make such an assignment or
transfer) without the consent or approval  of a third party would constitute
a breach or other contravention of the  rights  of such third party (such
assets being collectively referred to herein as  " _Restricted Assets_ ")
until such consent or approval is obtained; and any  assignment or transfer
of a Restricted Asset shall be made subject to such  consent or approval
being obtained. If any such consent or approval  is not obtained prior to the
Closing, (i) the assigning party, upon request  of the other party, shall
continue to use its commercially reasonable efforts  to  cooperate with the
other party in attempting to obtain any such consent or  approval and (ii)
the parties agree to negotiate in good faith with respect  to alternative
arrangements (such as a license, sublease or operating agreement)  until such
time as such consent or approval has been obtained which would  result  in
the assignee party receiving all the benefits and bearing all the costs, 
liabilities and burdens with respect to any such Restricted Asset.

given  no later than the date on which the Closing would otherwise occur

(b) During  the 30 day period following the Seller's receipt of the
Statement, the Seller  and its advisors (including its accountants) shall be
permitted to review  the  working papers of the Purchaser and its
accountants relating to the Statement;  _provided_ that the Seller and its
advisors (including its accountants)  shall have executed all release letters
reasonably requested by the Purchaser  and its accountants in connection
therewith. The Statement shall  become final and binding upon the parties on
the 30th day following  delivery thereof, unless the Seller gives written
notice of its disagreement  with the Statement (the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to the Purchaser prior  to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall be signed by the  Seller and shall (i) specify in
reasonable detail the nature of any  disagreement so asserted, (ii) only
include disagreements based on  mathematical errors or based on the Closing
Working Capital not being calculated  in accordance with this Article I and
(iii) specify what the Seller  reasonably believes is the correct amount of
the Closing Working Capital  based  on the disagreements set forth in the
Notice of Disagreement, including a  reasonably detailed description of the
adjustments applied to the Statement  in  calculating such amount. If the
Notice of Disagreement is received by  the Purchaser within the
aforementioned thirty day period, then the Statement  (as revised in
accordance with this sentence) shall become final and binding  upon the
Purchaser and the Seller on the earlier of (i) the date the  Purchaser and
the Seller resolve in writing any differences they have with  respect to the
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (ii) the  date any
disputed matters are finally resolved in writing by the Accounting  Firm.
During the thirty day period following the delivery of the  Notice of
Disagreement, the Purchaser and the Seller shall seek in good faith  to 
resolve in writing any differences that they may have with respect to the 
matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. During such period,  the
Purchaser and its advisors (including its accountants) shall have access 
to  the working papers of the Seller and its accountants prepared in
connection  with  the Notice of Disagreement; _provided_ that the Purchaser
and its advisors  (including its accountants) shall have executed all release
letters reasonably  requested by the Seller or its accountants in
connection  therewith. At the end of such 30 day period, the Purchaser and
the  Seller shall submit to an independent accounting firm (the "
_Accounting  Firm_ ") for resolution any matters that remain in dispute and
which were  properly included in the Notice of Disagreement, in the form of a
written  brief. The Accounting Firm shall be an internationally recognized 
independent public accounting firm as shall be agreed upon by the parties 
hereto  in writing that is not either the Purchaser's or the Seller's outside
accounting  firm involved with the Closing Working Capital under this 
Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller shall jointly instruct the 
Accounting Firm that it (i) shall review only the matters that were  properly
included in the Notice of Disagreement and which remain unresolved,  (ii)
shall make its determination in accordance with the requirements of  this
Section 1.05 and (iii) shall to the extent practicable render its  decision
within 30 days from the submission of such matters. Judgment  may be entered
upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in any court  having 
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be 
enforced. The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm  incurred
pursuant to this Section 1.05(b) shall be shared equally by the  Purchaser
and the Seller. The fees, costs and expenses of the  Purchaser incurred in
connection with its preparation of the Statement, its  review of any Notice
of Disagreement and its preparation of its written brief  submitted to the
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Purchaser, and the  fees,  costs and
expenses of the Seller incurred in connection with its review of  the 
Statement, its preparation, review and certification of the Notice of 
Disagreement and its preparation of its written brief submitted to the 
Accounting Firm shall be borne by the Seller.

(c) The  Estimated Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount by which
the Closing  Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital Estimate, and the
Estimated Purchase  Price shall be decreased by the amount by which the
Closing Working Capital  is  less than the Working Capital Amount (the
Estimated Purchase Price as so  increased or decreased shall hereinafter be
referred to as the " _Final  Purchase Price_ "). If the Estimated Purchase
Price is less than  the Final Purchase Price, the Purchaser shall, and if the
Estimated Purchase  Price is more than the Final Purchase Price, the Seller
shall, within five  business days after the Statement becomes final and
binding on the parties,  make  payment by wire transfer of immediately
available funds of the amount of  such  difference, together with interest
thereon at a rate equal to the rate of  interest from time to time announced
publicly by Citibank, N.A., as its prime  rate, calculated on the basis of
the actual number of days elapsed divided  by  365, from (and including) the
Closing Date through (but not including) the  date  of payment.

 

 

(d) The  parties acknowledge and agree that the adjustment to the Estimated
Purchase  Price, if any, contemplated by this Section 1.05 can only be
effected as  intended by the parties if the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital  is  done in accordance with the Working Capital Principles.
The scope of  the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting Firm shall be
limited to whether  there were mathematical errors in the Statement and
whether the calculation  of  the Closing Working Capital was done in
accordance with this Section 1.05,  and  the Accounting Firm is not to make
any other determination, including any  determination as to whether GAAP was
followed in calculating the Working  Capital  Amount, the Closing Working
Capital or the Statement or as to whether the  Working Capital Amount is
correct. Any determinations by the  Accounting Firm, and any work or analyses
performed by the Accounting Firm  in  connection with its resolution of any
dispute under this Section 1.05, shall  not  be admissible in evidence in
any suit, action or other proceeding between  the  parties, other than to
the extent necessary to enforce payment obligations  under  Section 1.05(c).
With respect to the final calculation of Closing  Working Capital pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, the amount of any  item  determined by the
Accounting Firm shall not be greater than the larger of  the  amounts or
smaller than the smaller of the amounts as prepared by the Purchaser  or the
Seller.

 

 

(e) Following  the Closing, the Purchaser shall not take any action with
respect to the  accounting books and records of the Business on which the
Statement is to  be  based primarily for the purpose of obstructing,
preventing or otherwise  affecting the results of the procedures set forth in
this Section 1.05  (including the amount of the Closing Working Capital or
any other amount  included in the Working Capital Amount or the Statement or
the preparation  of  the Statement). From and after the Closing Date through
the  resolution of any adjustment to the Estimated Purchase Price
contemplated  by  this Section 1.05, the Purchaser shall (i) assist, and
shall cause its  subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) to assist,
the Seller,  its  advisors (including its accountants) and other
representatives in the review  of  the Statement and (ii) afford to the
Seller, its advisors (including its  accountants) and other representatives,
reasonable access during normal business  hours to the personnel, properties,
books and records of the Business to  the  extent relevant to the review of
the Statement or the adjustment to the  Estimated Purchase Price contemplated
by this Section 1.05.

otherwise hold its assets and  properties and (b) to conduct its business as

to fully perform its obligations hereunder  or thereunder and to consummate
the Acquisition and the other transactions  contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution and delivery by the  Seller of this Agreement and the execution
and delivery by each Transferor  of  the Ancillary Agreements to which it
is, or is specified to be, a party and  the  consummation by the Transferors
of the Acquisition and the other transactions  contemplated hereby and

Transferors, and no other action on the part of  the  Transferors is
necessary to authorize this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements  or the
consummation of the Acquisition or the other transactions contemplated 
hereby or thereby. The Seller has duly executed and delivered this  Agreement
and, prior to the Closing, each Transferor will have duly executed  and 
delivered each Ancillary Agreement to which it is, or is specified to be, 
a  party, and, assuming their due execution and delivery by the Purchaser,
this  Agreement constitutes the Seller's, and each Ancillary Agreement to
which it is,  or is specified to be, a party will, after execution and
delivery by each  Transferor, constitute such Transferor's, legal, valid and
binding obligation,  enforceable against it in accordance with its terms,

_Representations  and Warranties_

 

_Relating  to the Transferred Entities and the Transferred Assets_

 

 

Except  as  set forth in the Seller Letter (each section of which qualifies
only the  correspondingly numbered representation and warranty and only such
other  representations and warranties to the extent a matter in such section
is  disclosed in such a manner as to make its relevance to the information
called  for by such other representation and warranty reasonably apparent),
the Seller  hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser on the date of
this Agreement  and on the Closing Date as follows:

 

 

SECTION  3.01. _Organization  and Standing; Books and Records._

 

 

(a) Each  Transferred Entity is duly organized, validly existing and, except
in any  jurisdiction that does not recognize such concept, in good standing
under  the  laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized. Each
Transferred  Entity has all requisite power and authority necessary (i) to
enable it to  own, lease or otherwise hold its assets and properties and (ii)
to conduct  its business as currently conducted. Each Transferred Entity is
duly  qualified and in good standing to do business as a foreign entity in
each  jurisdiction in which the conduct or nature of the Business or the
ownership,  leasing or holding of the Business's properties makes such

Interests, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no equity interests 
in a  Transferred Entity issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding and
there  are no  preemptive or similar rights on the part of any holder of any

Equity  Interests may vote (" _Transferred Entity Voting Debt_ "). As of 
the date of this Agreement, there are not any options, warrants, rights, 
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock 
appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts,

transactions contemplated by this Agreement  do not  conflict in any
material respect with, materially alter or impair any rights  in  and to any
Transferred Intellectual Property or any Transferred  Technology.

(k) There  is  no Contract, agreement, plan, or arrangement covering any
person that,  individually or collectively, could give rise to the payment of
any amount  as a  result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
that would not  be  deductible by the Purchaser or any Transferred Entity by
reason of  Section 280G of the Code.

the Business or to which any Transferred  Entity is a party that (a) alleges
damages or other liabilities in excess  of $200,000, (b) seeks any injunctive
relief affecting the Business or  (c) is reasonably likely to give rise to
any legal restraint on or  prohibition against the transactions contemplated

supplier, customer, lessor,  lessee, or competitor of the Business;
_provided_ , that ownership of  securities of a company whose securities are
registered under the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of five
percent (5%) or less of any class  of  such securities shall not be deemed

Transferred Entity), on the other hand, will  continue in effect subsequent

date of this Agreement. There are no  conditions or other contingencies to
the funding of the Financing other than  those contained in the Financing
Commitments. Except to the extent  permitted by Section 5.03(b), none of the
Financing Commitments has been  amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
and the commitments contained  in the  Financing Commitments have not been
reduced, terminated, withdrawn or rescinded  in any respect. The Financing
Commitments are in full force and  effect and are the legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Purchaser  and, to  the Purchaser's knowledge,
the applicable counterparties thereto. To  the knowledge of the Purchaser, no
event has occurred which, with or without  notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default or breach on the  part  of the Purchaser under
any term or condition of the Financing  Commitments. The Purchaser has fully
paid any commitment fees or  other fees incurred in connection with the
Financing that have become due  and  payable. The Financing, when funded in
accordance with the Financing  Commitments, will provide funds at the Closing
sufficient to consummate the  Acquisition and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and  to pay  the related fees and expenses
associated therewith. As of the date of  this Agreement, assuming the
accuracy of the representations and warranties  of  the Seller set forth in
Articles II and III, the Purchaser has no reason  to  believe that any of
the conditions or other contingencies to the Financing  will  not be
satisfied upon the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by  applicable
Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII or that  the 
Financing will not be available to the Purchaser at the Closing.

this Agreement) and, prior to the Closing,  will not have incurred

rights generally and subject to  general principles of equity, regardless of
whether considered in a proceeding  in equity or at Law. To the knowledge of
the Purchaser, no event has  occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would constitute  a default on the part of any Sponsor Fund
under its Sponsor Fund  Guarantee.

 

 

SECTION  4.10. _Going  Concern._ Without prejudice to the Purchaser's rights
to operate  the Business following the Closing in its sole discretion, the
Purchaser  is  acquiring the Business as a going concern for the purpose of
carrying out  a  business that is similar to the Business following the
Closing.

 

 

SECTION  4.11. _Brokers  or Finders._ No agent, broker, investment banker or
other person  engaged by or on behalf of the Purchaser or any of its
affiliates is or will  be  entitled to any broker's or finder's fee or any
other commission or similar fee  in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  4.12. _No  Other Representations and Warranties._ Except for the 
representations and warranties contained in Article II and Article III  or in
any certificate delivered by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement,  the 
Purchaser acknowledges that neither the Seller nor any person on behalf of 
the  Seller makes or has made any other express or implied representation or
warranty  (including as to merchantability or fitness for any particular
purpose) with  respect to the Acquisition or the other transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, with respect to the Seller or the Business
or with respect to  any  other information provided or made available to the
Purchaser in connection  with  the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including in any "data rooms" or management presentations). None
of the Seller or its affiliates  shall have or be subject to any liability or
indemnification obligation to  the  Purchaser or its affiliates resulting
from the distribution to the Purchaser,  or  the Purchaser's use of, any
such information.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Closing to occur and to
consummate  the Acquisition, the Financing and the other transactions
contemplated by  this  Agreement, including taking all reasonable actions
necessary to comply promptly  with all legal requirements that may be imposed
on it or any of its affiliates  with respect to the Closing. In furtherance
of the foregoing, each  party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to take, or cause to  be  taken, all appropriate action, do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary,  proper or advisable under applicable Laws, and
to execute and deliver such  instruments and documents as may be required to
carry out the provisions  of this  Agreement and to consummate the
Acquisition, the Financing and the other  transactions contemplated hereby.

 

 

(ii) Each  party shall, and shall cause each of its affiliates to, use its
commercially  reasonable efforts to take all actions and to do, cause to be
done, and assist  and cooperate with the other party in doing, all things
necessary or desirable  to (A) make any filing or declaration with, give any
notices to, or obtain  any Consent of, any Governmental Entity which filing,

including filings, notifications  and  Consents under applicable

the  foregoing:

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(1) The  Purchaser and the Seller shall, as promptly as reasonably
practicable after  the  date of this Agreement, file with all applicable
U.S. and foreign Governmental  Entities any notices and applications
necessary to obtain merger control  or  competition Law approval for the
Acquisition; _provided_ that each of the  Seller and the Purchaser shall have
the right to review and provide comments  on  any such notices and
applications prior to their filing. Without  limiting the foregoing, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall, as promptly as  reasonably practicable after
the date of this Agreement, file with the United  States Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the United States  Department of Justice (the
" _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form, if  any, required under the HSR
Act for the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement. Subject to
reasonable confidentiality restrictions, the  Purchaser and the Seller shall
each furnish to the other such necessary  information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request  in  connection with its
preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary  under the HSR Act
or any Foreign Merger Control Law. The Purchaser  and the Seller shall comply
promptly with any inquiry or request for additional  information from any
Governmental Entity and shall promptly provide any  supplemental information
requested in connection with the filings made hereunder  pursuant to the HSR
Act or any Foreign Merger Control Law. Each party  shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any clearance or  approval, and to cause the
expiration or termination of any waiting period,  required under the HSR Act
and any Foreign Merger Control Law for the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each  party shall not, and shall cause its
affiliates not to, enter into, or  consummate any acquisition or license
agreement which would present a material  risk of making it materially more
difficult to obtain any approval or  authorization for the Acquisition under
the HSR Act or any Foreign Merger  Control Law. For purposes of this Section
5.03, "commercially  reasonable efforts" shall include (A) opposing any
action for a temporary,  preliminary or permanent injunction against the
Acquisition, (B) entering  into a  consent decree containing the Purchaser's
agreement to hold separate and divest  the products and assets of the
Business as may be required by any Governmental  Entity and (C) responding to
any request for additional information issued  by the FTC or DOJ, as
applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that,  notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this  Agreement shall require the
Purchaser to implement any divesture or agree  to any  other condition or
consent decree or enter into any contract if doing so  would  reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have an adverse  impact (other
than a _de minimis_ adverse impact) __ on the  Business.

 

 

(2) Each  party shall (A) promptly inform, and provide copies to, the other
party of  any communication received from, or given by it to, any
Governmental Entity  with  respect to obtaining clearance or approval, or
the expiration or termination  of  any waiting, notice or review periods,
for the Acquisition under the HSR  Act,  any Foreign Merger Control Law and
ITAR, (B) to the extent practicable and  subject to reasonable
confidentiality restrictions, provide the other party  and  its counsel with
advance notice of, and the opportunity to participate in,  any  discussion,
telephone call or meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect  of  any
filing, investigation or other inquiry in connection with the Acquisition 
and to participate in the preparation for such discussion, telephone call 
or  meeting and (C) to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject
to  reasonable confidentiality restrictions, consult with each other prior
to  filing  or submitting documents or entering into discussions with any
Governmental  Entity and give each other advance notice to engage in
meaningful consultation  with respect thereto.

(iii) Notwithstanding  anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
failure to obtain any consent  or  approval required in connection with a
Restricted Asset, after the party  responsible for obtaining the same has
used its commercially reasonable efforts  to obtain such consent or approval,
shall not, individually or in the aggregate,  constitute a material adverse
effect on the Purchaser, on the Seller or on  the  Business, as applicable,
a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant  or  agreement under this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant to this  Agreement or a
failure of any condition under this Agreement.

 

 

(b) _Financing._ (i) The  Purchaser shall, and shall cause its affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable  efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, do, or cause  to  be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable  Laws, and to execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered,  such  instruments and
documents as may be reasonably required, to arrange and  consummate the
Financing on or prior to the Closing on the terms and subject  only to the
conditions contained in the Financing Commitments, including  using  its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the conditions in the Financing 
Commitments that are within the Purchaser's control to be satisfied and to
cause  the financial institutions providing the Debt Financing to fund the
Debt  Financing.

 

 

(ii) The  Purchaser shall not agree to or permit any material amendment,
supplement  or  other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, any
Financing  Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing
without  the  Seller's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld, except that the  Purchaser may amend, supplement or otherwise
modify the Debt Financing  Commitments if such amendment, supplement or other
modification would not  be  reasonably likely to materially impair or delay
the funding of the Debt  Financing or the Closing (it being understood that,
subject to the requirements  of this clause (ii), such amendment, supplement
or other modification  (1) does not contain additional or modified conditions
or other  contingencies to the funding of the Debt Financing relative to
those contained  in Debt Financing Commitments and (2) is otherwise not
reasonably likely  to  impair or delay the funding of the Debt Financing or
the Closing (it being  understood than, subject to the requirements of this
clause (ii), such  amendment, supplement or other modification of the Debt
Financing Commitments  may provide for the assignment of a portion of the
Debt Financing Commitment  to  additional agents or arrangers and grant such
persons approval rights with  respect to certain matters as are customarily
granted to additional agents  or  arrangers).

(iii) If  any  portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions  contained in the Financing Commitments, the Purchaser shall
promptly notify  the  Seller, and the Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to  obtain, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event,  replacement commitments on terms that will enable
the Purchaser to consummate  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that are not less favorable  in the aggregate (as determined by the
Purchaser in its reasonable judgment)  to  the Purchaser and the Seller than
those contained in the Financing  Commitments. The Purchaser shall deliver to
the Seller complete and  correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other
modifications or agreements  pursuant to which any amended, supplemented,
modified or replacement commitments  shall provide the Purchaser with any
portion of the Financing; _provided_   that the Purchaser may redact from any
such copies the fee amounts and pricing  information payable to their
Financing sources.

 

 

(iv) The  Seller shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries to, and shall use
its  commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its subsidiaries'
independent  accountants, legal counsel and other advisors to, provide such
reasonable  cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing as may  be  reasonably requested by the Purchaser or their
Financing sources, including  (A) participation in meetings, drafting
sessions, presentations, road shows  and due diligence sessions, (B) using
commercially reasonable efforts to  furnish the Purchaser and its Debt
Financing sources with the Required Financial  Information and such other
information and projections reasonably requested  by  the Purchaser in
connection with the Debt Financing, (C) assisting the  Purchaser and its Debt
Financing sources in the preparation of (1) offering  documents and other
informational and marketing materials and documents to  be  used for the
Debt Financing and (2) materials for rating agency  presentations, (D)
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of the  Purchaser and its
Debt Financing sources, including using commercially  reasonable efforts to
cause the syndication of the Debt Financing to benefit  materially with
Seller's and Company's existing lending relationships,  (E) reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral including real  property collateral
and execution and delivery of definitive agreements relating  to the
Financing and customary deliverables and (F) using commercially  reasonable
efforts to obtain accountants' "comfort letters", accountants' consent
letters, legal opinions, customary landlord lien and access waivers, 
surveys, appraisals and title insurance as reasonably requested by the 
Purchaser; _provided_ that none of the Seller nor any of its subsidiaries 
shall be required to pay any commitment or other fee or incur any other 
liability in connection with the Debt Financing; and _provided further_  
that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the 
ongoing  operations of the Seller and its subsidiaries. The Purchaser
shall,  promptly upon request by the Seller, reimburse the Seller for all
reasonable  and  documented out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller or
any of its subsidiaries  in connection with such cooperation. The Seller
shall have the right  to consent to the use of its and its subsidiaries'
logos in connection with the  Debt Financing.

basis of  any  material developments relating to the Financing.

 

 

(vi) The  Purchaser acknowledges that the information being provided to it in
connection  with the Financing is subject to the terms of Section 6.02(a).

 

 

(vii) The  Seller understands that the majority of the Purchase Price will be
financed  with  proceeds of the Debt Financing, which will be provided by
third party  sources. The Seller accordingly acknowledges that the
obligations of  the Purchaser under this Section 5.03(b) do not require the
Purchaser or  any of  its affiliates to provide the Debt Financing
themselves if such third party  sources fail to provide the Debt Financing or
to guarantee that such third  party  sources will provide the Debt Financing
but only requires that the Purchaser  use  its commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange and consummate the Debt  Financing.

 

 

(viii) In  the  event the Seller or any Transferred Entity suffers on or
prior to the Closing  any casualty or loss to any building, structure,
material fixture or material  improvement included within the Transferred
Real Property, the Seller shall  assign to the Purchaser insurance proceeds
sufficient to cover such casualty  or  loss or otherwise make adequate
provisions to bear the cost of the repair  or  replacement of such building,
structure, material fixture or material  improvement.

following sentence, Section 1.05(b), paragraph (b) of this  Section 5.04,
Section 5.06(f), Section 6.06(b),  Section 6.09(b) and Section 8.02(e), each
party shall bear its and its  affiliates' fees, costs and expenses (including
fees, costs and expenses of  legal counsel and other representatives and
consultants) incurred by them  in  connection with the negotiation of this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements  and consummation of the Acquisition,
the Financing and the other transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, all  fees, costs and expenses (including fees,
costs and expenses of legal counsel)  incurred in connection with compliance
with and filings and approvals under  merger control and competition Laws,

hand, and the Seller, on the other  hand.

excise,  real property transfer or gains, or similar Taxes (the " _Transfer
Taxes_ ")  applicable to the transfer of the Transferred Assets, the Excluded
Assets  or the  Purchased Companies' Equity Interests shall be shared
equally by the Purchaser,  on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other
hand. Each party shall  use commercially reasonable efforts to avail itself
of any available exemptions  from any such Transfer Taxes, and to cooperate
with the other in providing any  information and documentation that may be
necessary to obtain such  exemptions. The Purchaser, the Seller and the
Transferred Entities  shall jointly file all required returns and similar
statements and take all  other actions under all applicable transfer
notification statutes and  regulations and all applicable Tax statutes and
regulations that are required  to  be made or taken by the parties in
connection with or as a result of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

SECTION  5.05. _Tax  Matters._ (a) _Return Filings._ For any  taxable
period of the Transferred Entities that includes (but does not end  on)  the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall timely prepare (or cause to be prepared) 
and file with the appropriate Taxing Authorities all Tax Returns required  to
be  filed on a basis consistent with past practices of the Business and
shall  pay  (or cause to be paid) all Taxes due with respect to such Tax
Returns;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Seller shall pay the Purchaser
at  least five days before such Tax Return is due any amount owed by the
Seller  pursuant to Section 9.01(a) with respect to the taxable periods
covered by  such Tax Returns. For any taxable period of the Transferred
Entities  that ends on or before the Closing Date, the Seller shall timely
prepare  and  file with the appropriate Taxing Authority all Tax Returns
required to be  filed;  _provided_ that if such Tax Return is required to be
filed by a Transferred  Entity after the Closing Date, the Seller shall
deliver such Tax Return to  the  Purchaser which shall sign and file such
Tax Return; and _provided further_   that any such Tax Return described in
this sentence shall be prepared, on  a  basis consistent with the past
practices of the Business and in accordance  with  applicable Law. The
Seller shall pay all Taxes due with respect to  such Tax Returns and, if such
Tax Return is to be filed by the Purchaser,  shall  pay the Purchaser at
least five days before such Tax Return is due any amount  shown as due on
such Tax Return.

 

 

(b) The  Seller shall include the income of the Transferred Entities
(including any  deferred income triggered into income under Treasury
Regulations  Sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 and any excess loss accounts
taken into  income under Treasury Regulations Section 1.1502-19, and any
income  triggered under any comparable provisions of state, local or foreign
law)  resulting from or related to transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  and  arising on or before the Closing Date on the relevant Seller
group consolidated,  combined and unitary Tax Returns for all periods through
and including the  Closing Date and pay any federal, foreign, state or local
income Taxes  attributable to such income.

 

 

(c) _Cooperation_. The  Purchaser and the Seller shall reasonably cooperate,
and shall cause their  affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and
representatives to  reasonably cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax
Returns, including  maintaining and making available to each other all
records necessary in  connection with Taxes and in resolving all suits,
claims, actions,  investigations, proceedings or audits (collectively, "
_Actions_ ") with  respect to all taxable periods relating to Taxes involving
or otherwise relating  to the Transferred Entities or Transferred Assets. The
Seller and its  affiliates will need access, from time to time, after the
Closing Date, to  certain accounting and Tax records and information held by
the Transferred  Entities to the extent such records and information pertain
to events occurring  prior to the Closing Date; therefore, the Purchaser
shall, and shall cause  each  Transferred Entity to, (i) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to  properly retain and maintain such records
for ten (10) years and shall  thereafter provide the Seller with written
notice prior to any destruction,  abandonment or disposition, (ii) transfer
such records to the Seller upon  its written request prior to any such
destruction, abandonment or disposition  and (ii) allow the Seller and its
agents and representatives (and agents or  representatives of any of its
affiliates), at times and dates mutually  acceptable to the parties, to
inspect, review and make copies of such records  as  the Seller may deem
necessary or appropriate from time to time, such activities  to be conducted
during normal business hours and at the Seller's  expense. Any information
obtained under this Section 5.05(c)  shall be kept confidential, except as
may be otherwise necessary in connection  with the filing of Tax Returns or
in the conduct of an audit or other  Action.

(d) _Refunds  and Credits_. Any refund or credit of Taxes, or any tax benefit
or  reduction (including as a result of any overpayment of Taxes in prior
periods)  accruing to the Purchaser or any of its affiliates as a result of
the ownership  of the Business (each, a " _Tax Asset_ ") attributable to any
taxable period  ending on or before the Closing Date shall be for the account
of the Seller,  unless any such refund or credit (i) is attributable to the
carryback from  a  Post-Closing Tax Period of items of loss, deductions or
other Tax items of  the  Transferred Entities (or any of their affiliates,
including the Purchaser)  or  (ii) relates to the shift in timing of the
incurrence of tax liabilities  from a  Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Post-
Closing Tax Period. Any Tax Asset  attributable to any Straddle Period shall
be apportioned between the Purchaser  and the Seller in accordance with the
principles of Section  9.01(c). Each party shall forward, and shall cause its
affiliates to  forward, to the party entitled pursuant to this Section
5.05(d) to receive  the  amount or economic benefit of the Tax Asset within
10 days after such Tax  Asset  is received or after such Tax Asset is
allowed or applied against another  Tax  liability, as the case may be.

 

 

(e) _Tax  Sharing Agreements_. The Seller shall cause the provisions of any 
agreement relating to the sharing, allocation or indemnification of Taxes, 
or  any similar agreement, contract or arrangement (collectively, " _Tax
Sharing  Agreements_ ") between the Seller or any of their affiliates (other
than the  Transferred Entities) and any Transferred Entity to be terminated
on or before  the Closing Date. After the Closing Date, no party shall have
any  rights or obligations under any such Tax Sharing Agreement.

 

 

(f) _Closing  Date_. On the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall cause each 
Transferred Entity to conduct its business in the ordinary course in 
substantially the same manner as currently conducted and on the Closing Date 
shall not permit any Transferred Entity to effect any extraordinary
transactions  (other than any such transactions expressly required by
applicable law or  by  this Agreement) that could result in Tax liability to
any Transferred Entity  in  excess of Tax liability associated with the
conduct of its business in the  ordinary course.

 

 

(g) _Purchase  Price Adjustments_. The Purchaser and the Seller agree to
treat  any amounts payable pursuant to Section 5.05(c) or Article IX as 
adjustments to the Purchase Price for all Tax purposes, unless a final 
determination causes any such payment not to be treated as an adjustment  to
the  Purchase Price for U.S. Federal income Tax purposes. Neither the 
Purchaser nor the Seller shall file any Tax Return, or take a position with 
a  Taxing Authority, that (i) is inconsistent with the Allocation or  (ii)
treats the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner 
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, unless required to do so by 
a  final determination and after which prompt notice thereof shall be given 
to the  other parties to this Agreement.

(h) _Purchase  Price Allocation._ (i) The Purchaser and the Seller  agree to
allocate for all Tax purposes the Purchase Price (taking into account  any
adjustments under Section 5.05(f)), of the Transferred Assets and the  stock
of the Purchased Companies, the amount of the liabilities of the Purchased 
Companies that are liabilities for income tax purposes and any other
relevant  items among the Transferred Assets and the stock of the Purchased
Companies  in  accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations  thereunder (the " _Asset Allocation_ ").

 

 

(ii) The  Purchaser shall deliver a draft of the Asset Allocation (the "
_Proposed Asset  Allocation_ ") to the Seller for its consent, which consent
shall not be  unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, no later than 90
days after  the  Closing Date. Except as provided in subparagraphs (j) and
(k) of this  Section 5.05, at the close of business on the 30th day after
delivery of  the Proposed Asset Allocation, the Proposed Asset Allocation
shall become  binding upon the Purchaser and the Seller and shall be the
Asset  Allocation.

 

 

(iii) The  Seller shall raise any objection to the Proposed Asset Allocation
in writing  within 30 days of the delivery of the Proposed Asset Allocation.
The  Purchaser and the Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any 
differences for 30 days after delivery of any objection by the  Seller. If
the Purchaser and the Seller reach written agreement  amending the Proposed
Asset Allocation, the Proposed Asset Allocation, as  so  amended, shall
become binding upon Purchaser and Seller and shall be the  Asset 
Allocation.

 

 

(iv) If  the  Purchaser and the Seller cannot agree on the appropriate
allocation within  the  30-day period set forth in subparagraph (j) above,
then all remaining  disputed items shall be submitted for resolution by an
Accounting Firm mutually  selected by the Purchaser and the Seller (the "
_Allocation Accounting  Firm_ "). The Allocation Accounting Firm shall make a
final  determination as to the disputed items within 30 days after such 
submission. Such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive  on the
Purchaser and the Seller and shall be the Asset  Allocation. The fees and
expenses of the Allocation Accounting Firm  shall be shared equally between
the Purchaser and the Seller.

 

 

(v) The  Asset  Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustments to
the Purchase Price  under this Agreement. Except as required by applicable
law, the  Purchaser and the Seller shall, and shall cause their affiliates
to, file  all  Tax returns consistent with the Asset Allocation, as so
amended.

SECTION  5.07. _Section 338(g)  Election._ The Purchaser shall be permitted
to make an election  under Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the
transfer of any  eligible Transferred Entity that is not a U.S. Transferred
Entity (a " _Foreign  Transferred Entity_ "); _provided_ that any additional
Taxes imposed on  the Seller or any of its affiliates as a result of such an
election shall  be  subject to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.01(b).
If the  Purchaser intends to make an election under Section 338(g) of the
Code, the  Purchaser shall first give reasonable notice to the Seller. The 
Seller shall then notify the Purchaser, within a reasonable period of time, 
of  any increase in Tax liability that may result from such an  election.
Upon receiving notice from the Seller, the Purchaser may  choose whether to
make, or refrain from making, such election.

 

 

SECTION  5.08. _Employee  Matters._ (a) Effective as of the Closing, the
Purchaser  shall, or shall cause its affiliates to, make offers of employment
(which  offers  shall be in compliance with the Purchaser's covenants set
forth in this  Section 5.08) to, or continue the employment of, as
applicable, each  Business Employee who is actively employed by Seller or its
affiliates as  of the  Closing Date (each, an " _Active Employee_ "). The
Seller shall  not knowingly take any action to discourage any Business
Employee from accepting  such offer of employment. For purposes of this
Agreement, any  Business Employee who is not actively at work on the Closing
Date due to  an  approved leave of absence (including due to vacation,
holiday, sick leave,  workers compensation, maternity or paternity leave,
military leave, jury  duty,  bereavement leave or injury, but not including
due to unauthorized leave  of  absence or lay-off), other than short-term or
long-term disability leave,  in  compliance with the applicable policies of
the Seller and its affiliates,  shall  be considered an Active Employee. The
Purchaser will comply, and will  cause its affiliates to comply, with the
requirements of all applicable CBAs  relating to the rights of any laid-off
employee of the Business who is not  actively at work on the Closing Date due
to a lay-off to be recalled to active  employment with the Purchaser or its
affiliates following the Closing  Date. With respect to each Business
Employee who is not actively at  work as of the Closing Date due to short-
term or long-term disability leave  (each, a " _Disabled Employee_ "),
effective as of the date on which such  Disabled Employee presents himself or
herself to the Purchaser for active  employment following the Closing Date,
_provided_ such Disabled Employee is  cleared for work and presents himself
or herself to the Purchaser for active  employment within 180 days following
the Closing Date, (i) in the case  of any such Disabled Employee who was
employed by a Transferred Entity  immediately prior to the date such
employee's disability leave began, the  Purchaser shall continue the
employment of such Disabled Employee and  (ii) in the case of any such
Disabled Employee who was employed by the  Seller or one of its affiliates
(other than a Transferred Entity) immediately  prior to the date such
employee's disability leave began, the Purchaser shall,  or shall cause its
affiliates to, make an offer of employment (which offer  shall  be in
compliance with the Purchaser's covenants set forth in this  Section 5.08) to
such Disabled Employee, in each case, with job  responsibilities that are
substantially similar to such Disabled Employee's job  responsibilities with
the Seller or its affiliates immediately prior to the  date  such employee
commenced disability leave, to the same extent, if any, as  the  Seller or
its affiliates would have been required to re-employ such Disabled  Employee
if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement had not occurred,  in 
accordance with applicable Law and any applicable collective bargaining 
agreement. Business Employees who transfer to the Purchaser or one of  its
affiliates, as of the effective date of such transfer, shall be referred 
to  as " _Transferred Employees_ ", and the date that such Business
Employee  transfers to the Purchaser or one of its affiliates shall be
referred to  as the " _Transfer Date_ ". In the case of (i) any Active
Employee or  (ii) any Disabled Employee who was employed by a Transferred
Entity immediately  prior to the date such employee's disability leave began,
the Transfer Date  shall be the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that,
except as  relates to any Assumed Benefit Plan, the Purchaser and its
affiliates shall  have  no liabilities or obligations with respect to any
such Disabled Employee  unless  and until such employee presents himself or
herself to the Purchaser or its  affiliates for active employment in
accordance with this Section  5.08(a). In the case of any Disabled Employee
who was employed by the  Seller or one of its affiliates (other than a
Transferred Entity) immediately  prior to the date such employee's disability
leave began, the Transfer Date  shall be the date such employee commences
active employment with the Purchaser  or its affiliates. The Seller and the
Purchaser intend that the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
not constitute a severance  of  employment of any Transferred Employee prior
to or upon the consummation  of the  transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that Transferred Employees  will  have continuous and
uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately  after the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this  Agreement.

(b) During  the period from the Closing Date until the 12-month anniversary
of the Closing  Date (such period, the " _Continuation Period_ "), the
Purchaser or its  affiliates shall provide each Transferred Employee with (i)
a base salary  or rate of base pay that is at least equal to such Transferred
Employee's base  salary or rate of base pay immediately prior to the Closing
(provided that  such  base salary or rate of base pay is either the same as
in effect on the date  of  this Agreement or has been modified only to the
extent permitted by Section  5.01(s)) and (ii) other compensation and
employee benefits that, in the  aggregate, are substantially comparable to
the compensation and employee  benefits provided to each such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to  the  Closing (without regard to any changes
made pursuant to the authority set  forth  in Section 5.01(s) except for
cash bonuses paid in the ordinary course  consistent with Section 5.08(r));
_provided_ that (A) none of the Purchaser  or any of its affiliates shall
have any obligation to (i) issue, or adopt  any  plans or arrangements
providing for the issuance of equity or equity based  compensation, (ii)
provide post-retirement medical coverage unless such coverage  is both (x)
required pursuant to the terms of the CBAs and (y) applicable  solely  to
Transferred Employees (other than Retiree Medical Eligible Employees)  and 
(iii) provide a U.S. qualified or non-qualified defined benefit pension plan 
unless such coverage is both (x) required pursuant to the terms of the CBAs 
and  (y) applicable solely to Transferred Employees, (B) no such plans or 
arrangements of the Seller or its affiliates shall be taken into account 
in  determining whether compensation and employee benefits are
substantially  comparable in the aggregate and (C) the Seller's recently
approved defined  contribution benefit plan described in _Section 5.08(b)_ of
the Seller  Letter shall be taken into account in determining whether
compensation and  employee benefits of 401(k) Covered Employees are
substantially comparable  in  the aggregate. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or any other provision  of this Agreement to the contrary, in the case of any
Transferred Employee  whose  employment with the Seller or its affiliates is
covered by a collective  bargaining agreement immediately prior to the
Closing (a " _Represented  Employee_ "), during the Continuation Period, the
Purchaser and its affiliates  shall be permitted to make changes to such
Transferred Employee's compensation  and benefits to the extent permitted
under the applicable collective bargaining  agreement. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this  Agreement, the active participation and
accrual of benefits of the Transferred  Employees in the Seller Benefit Plans
(other than the Assumed Benefit Plans)  and  the other employee
compensation, benefit and perquisite plans, programs and  arrangements of the
Seller and its affiliates shall terminate effective as  of  12:01 a.m. on
each Transferred Employee's Transfer Date. Except  as required by applicable
Law, nothing herein shall (1) guarantee  employment of any Transferred
Employee for any period of time after the Closing  Date or preclude the
ability of the Purchaser to terminate the employment  of any  Transferred
Employee for any reason or no reason, or (2) other than as set  forth in
Sections 5.08(c), (l) and (q), require the Purchaser to continue  any 
particular employee benefit plan or arrangement after the Closing  Date. No
provision of this Section 5.08 shall create any third  party beneficiary or
other rights in any current or former employee of the  Seller, the Business
or the Purchaser (including any dependent or beneficiary  thereof) or any
other person or modify or create any employee benefit  plan. Except as set
forth in this Section 5.08(b) and Sections  5.08(c), (l) and (q) or as
required by applicable Law, the Purchaser and  its  affiliates, as
applicable, shall have the right in their sole discretion  to  amend,
modify, terminate or adjust benefit levels under any and all employee 
benefit plans and arrangements after the Closing Date, and, except as set 
forth  in Sections 5.08(c), (l) and (q) or as required by applicable Law,
nothing  in this Section 5.08 shall be construed to limit any rights that
the  Purchaser or any of its affiliates may have under any such plan or
arrangement  to amend, modify, terminate or adjust any particular plan or 
arrangement. No provision of this Section 5.08 is intended to  modify, amend
or create any employee benefit plan or arrangement of the Seller  or the
Purchaser or any affiliate of the Purchaser.

(c) Without  limiting the generality of Section 5.08(b), during the
Continuation Period,  the Purchaser shall, or shall cause its affiliates to,
provide each Transferred  Employee (other than any Represented Employee)
whose employment is terminated  by  the Purchaser or its affiliates during
the Continuation Period with severance  and other separation benefits that,
in the aggregate, are no less favorable  than  what would be provided to
such Transferred Employee pursuant to the Seller's  severance plan as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (a complete  and  correct copy of
which has been delivered to the Purchaser), taking into  account  such
Transferred Employee's service with the Purchaser and its affiliates 
following the Closing and all Pre-Closing Service; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,
that no such Transferred Employee will be entitled to  any of the  severance
or separation benefits pursuant to this Section 5.08(c) unless  and  until
such Transferred Employee executes a release of claims in favor of  both 
the Seller and the Purchaser, each of their subsidiaries and each of their 
respective predecessors, successors, parents and affiliates, and their 
respective present and former officers, directors, employees and agents, 
and  such release becomes effective and irrevocable.

 

 

 

(d) From  and  after each Transferred Employee's Transfer Date, the
Purchaser shall, or shall  cause its affiliates to, credit service accrued by
Transferred Employees  with,  or otherwise recognized for benefit plan
purposes by, the Seller and its  affiliates (as well as service with any
predecessor employer of the Seller  or  any its affiliates, to the extent
service with the predecessor employer is  recognized by the Seller or any of
its affiliates) as of such Transferred  Employee's Transfer Date (" _Pre-
Closing Service_ ") for purposes of  eligibility to participate, vesting,
level of benefits and benefit accruals  and,  to the extent required by any
applicable CBA, for purposes of early retirement  eligibility and early
retirement subsidies, in each case, under any employee  benefit plans and
arrangements and employment-related entitlements sponsored,  maintained or
contributed to by the Purchaser or its affiliates to the same  extent
recognized by the Seller and its affiliates immediately prior to such 
Transferred Employee's Transfer Date, except (i) for benefit accrual
purposes  under any defined benefit pension plan of the Purchaser or its
affiliates,  (ii)  for eligibility purposes under any post-retirement
welfare benefit plan of  the  Purchaser or its affiliates, except as
required pursuant to the terms of  any  applicable CBA, or (iii) to the
extent such credit would result in duplication  of benefits for the same
period of service.

(e) With  respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained for the benefit of
Transferred  Employees or their dependents on and after each Transferred
Employee's Transfer  Date, the Purchaser shall (i) cause there to be waived
any pre-existing  condition limitations, exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements with  respect  to participation and coverage, to the extent
waived or satisfied under the  Seller Benefit Plans in effect as of the date
immediately prior to such  Transferred Employee's Transfer Date and (ii) give
effect, in determining  any deductible and maximum out-of-pocket limitations,
to claims incurred  and  amounts paid by, and amounts reimbursed to, such
Transferred Employees or  their  dependents in the plan year in which such
Transferred Employee's Transfer Date  occurs for purposes of satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket  requirements under any similar
welfare benefit plans in which such Transferred  Employees or their
dependents participate at or following the relevant Transfer  Date.

 

 

(f) The  Seller shall be responsible for providing such continuation
coverage, within  the  meaning of COBRA, as is required pursuant to COBRA in
respect of any Business  Employee or "qualified beneficiary" (as defined in
COBRA) of a Business Employee  who incurs a "qualifying event" prior to 12:01
a.m. on the Closing;  _provided_ that, in the event that such Business
Employee is covered by an  employee welfare benefit plan that is an Assumed
Benefit Plan, the Purchaser  shall be responsible for such continuation
coverage, regardless of whether  such  Business Employee incurs a qualifying
event before, on or after the Closing  Date. The Purchaser shall be
responsible for providing such  continuation coverage as is required under
COBRA in respect of any Transferred  Employee or qualified beneficiary of a
Transferred Employee, in each case,  who  incurs a qualifying event at or
following 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date  and any Business Employee described
in the proviso in the immediately preceding  sentence.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
the Seller shall retain  all liabilities, obligations and commitments with
respect to any non-qualified  defined benefit pension and non-qualified
defined contribution plans of the  Seller (including the Supplemental
Deferral Benefit Retirement Plan, the  Senior  Executive Pension Plan and
the Supplemental Contributing Employee Ownership  Plan), which liabilities,
obligations and commitments, other than those that  relate to the Benefit
Restoration Plan, shall be considered Excluded Liabilities  for purposes of
this Agreement. On or prior to the Closing, the  Seller shall cause to be
satisfied all liabilities, obligations and commitments  with respect to the
Chase Brass and Copper Company Benefit Restoration Plan  and shall be entitled
to the value of the assets in the account that was  previously established to
satisfy the liabilities under such  plan. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Agreement to the  contrary, the Seller shall retain all liabilities,
obligations and commitments  with respect to any stock incentive plan and
employee stock purchase plan  that  relates to shares of the Seller's common
stock (other than the Seller  401(k) Plan, to the extent that a rollover is
elected in accordance with  Section 5.08(p)), and all awards granted under
such plans, which  liabilities, obligations and commitments shall be
considered Excluded  Liabilities for purposes of this Agreement. Upon the
Closing, the  Seller shall fully vest (i) all Seller contributions to the
Seller 401(k)  Plan  and (ii) any other U.S. tax-qualified and supplemental
defined contribution  plans in which Transferred Employees participate.

(h) The  Seller agrees to allow each Transferred Employee who, immediately
prior to  the  Closing, has satisfied the eligibility criteria to receive
benefits under  the  Seller's post-retirement medical plans to participate
in, and receive benefits  from, the Seller's post-retirement medical plans
upon such employee's  eligibility to commence benefits in accordance with the
terms of such medical  plans as in effect from time to time. Solely in the
case of any  Transferred Employee who is within two years of satisfying such
eligibility  criteria as of the Closing, the Seller agrees to recognize such
Transferred  Employee's service with the Purchaser or its affiliates for
purposes of  satisfying such eligibility criteria. In the event that any
such  Transferred Employee is terminated by the Purchaser or its affiliates
without  cause (as reasonably determined in the Purchaser's discretion) prior
to the  second anniversary of the Closing, _provided_ that, in the case of
any  Transferred Employee whose employment is terminated by the Purchaser
during  the  Continuation Period, such Transferred Employee satisfies the
release requirement  set forth in Section 5.08(c), except to the extent
prohibited by any  applicable CBA, such Transferred Employee shall be deemed
to have satisfied  the  service-related eligibility criteria to receive
benefits under the Seller's  post-retirement medical plans as of the date the
release of claims executed  by  such Transferred Employee becomes effective
and  irrevocable. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the 
contrary, (i) nothing herein shall prohibit the Seller from amending, 
modifying or terminating any of its post-retirement welfare plans or prevent 
the  application of any such amendment, modification or termination to any 
Transferred Employee, _provided_ any such amendment, modification or 
termination is applied on substantially the same basis to all similarly
situated  active and retired employees of the Seller (it being understood
that status  as a  Transferred Employee shall not in and of itself make the
Transferred Employees  "similarly situated") and the Seller shall indemnify
and hold harmless the  Purchaser from all costs, expenses or other damages
that may result to the  Purchaser as a result of actions taken by the Seller
or its affiliates in  connection with, or as a result of any such amendment,
modification or  termination, (ii) the Purchaser shall provide, or cause its
affiliates to  provide, the Transferred Employees described in this Section
5.08(h) (such  employees, the " _Retiree Medical Eligible Employees_ ") with
medical  coverage under the Purchaser's plans on the same basis as such
coverage is  provided to other similarly situated Transferred Employees for
so long as  such  Retiree Medical Eligible Employees remain actively
employed with the Purchaser  or any of its affiliates, (iii) if the
employment of any Retiree Medical  Eligible Employee is involuntarily
terminated, such Retiree Medical Eligible  Employee shall be entitled to
post-employment medical coverage pursuant to  the  Purchaser's severance
plan that is applicable to such Transferred Employee on  the same basis as
such coverage is provided to other similarly situated  Transferred Employees
who have been terminated for the period required pursuant  to the applicable
Purchaser's severance plan, if any and (iv) while a  Retiree Medical Eligible
Employee remains eligible for coverage under the  Purchaser's plans in
accordance with the preceding clauses (ii) and (iii),  such Retiree Medical
Eligible Employee shall not be permitted to receive  post-retirement medical
benefits pursuant to the Seller's plans. For  the avoidance of doubt, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to  the  contrary, the Purchaser
shall not be obligated to provide post-retirement  medical coverage to any
Transferred Employee unless and to the extent  post-retirement medical
coverage is required by the applicable CBAs to be  provided to Transferred
Employees (other than Retiree Medical Eligible  Employees) covered by the
CBAs. No provision of this  Section 5.08 is intended to modify, amend or
create any employee benefit  plan or arrangement of the Seller or the
Purchaser or any of their  affiliates.

(i) Except  as  otherwise required under applicable Law, the Seller shall be
responsible  in  accordance with its welfare plans in effect prior to the
Closing for all  reimbursement claims (such as medical and dental claims) for
expenses incurred,  and for all non-reimbursement claims (such as life
insurance and disability  claims) incurred, under any Seller Benefit Plans
that are "employee welfare  benefit plans" (within the meaning of Section
3(1) of ERISA) prior to the  Closing by Employees and their dependents and
beneficiaries. Except  as otherwise required under applicable Law, the
Purchaser shall be responsible  for all reimbursement claims (such as medical
and dental claims) for expenses  incurred, and for all non-reimbursement
claims (such as life insurance and  disability claims) incurred from and
after 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date  by any Transferred Employee (and his or
her dependents and beneficiaries)  under  any welfare benefit plans of the
Purchaser or its affiliates. Except  as otherwise provided under applicable
Law, for purposes of this  Section 5.08(i), a claim shall be deemed to be
incurred as  follows: (1) life, accidental death and dismemberment, 
disability and business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death, 
accident or illness giving rise to such benefits and (2) health, dental and 
prescription drug benefits (including in respect of any hospital
confinement),  upon provision of the related services, materials or 
supplies. Notwithstanding any provision of this Section 5.08(i)  to the
contrary, in the case of any Disabled Employee, the Seller shall retain 
liability for all welfare benefit claims (including medical, dental and 
disability claims) incurred prior to the date such employee becomes actively 
employed by the Purchaser or its affiliates.

 

 

(j) Notwithstanding  any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, except
as specifically provided  in this Section 5.08(j), the Purchaser and its
affiliates shall be  responsible for all claims that are properly accrued on
the Statement or  that  relate to a reserve that is reflected on the
Statement and which are incurred  by  Transferred Employees prior to or on
the Closing under the workers compensation  plans of the Seller and its
affiliates, it being understood that all such  liabilities shall constitute
Transferred Liabilities with respect to which  the  Seller shall be entitled
to indemnification from the Purchaser pursuant to  Section 9.07; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the case of any  Disabled Employee, the Seller shall
retain liability for workers compensation  claims incurred prior to the date
such employee becomes actively employed  by the  Purchaser or its
affiliates. The Purchaser and its affiliates shall  administer all such
workers compensation claims in a commercially reasonable  manner and in
accordance with the past practices of the Seller and its  affiliates.

(k) Except  as  specifically provided in the immediately following sentence,
after the Closing,  the Seller agrees to assume and/or retain and shall
indemnify the Purchaser  and  the Transferred Entities against all
liabilities and obligations arising  out of  or relating to any and all
liabilities with respect to any employee benefit  plan  or arrangement that
relates to employees of the Seller or any Seller Commonly  Controlled Entity
that is subject to Section 302 of ERISA, Title IV of  ERISA, COBRA, Section
412 of the Code, the Coal Industry Retiree Health  Benefit Act of 1992, as
amended or any other statute that imposes liability  on a  so-called
controlled group basis with reference to any provision of  Section 52(a) or
Section 414 of the Code or Section 4001 of  ERISA, as applicable, that is due
to the Seller's and the Transferred Entities' status as part of a Seller
Commonly Controlled Entity (such liability,  collectively, " _Controlled
Group Liability_ "). Notwithstanding  the foregoing, the provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall  be  deemed not to apply to, and the
term "Controlled Group Liability" shall not  include, any liabilities or
obligations with respect to (i) any Assumed Benefit  Plan or (ii) the IAM
Fund to the extent it relates to the Business.

 

 

(l) As  of the  Closing Date, the Purchaser shall have in effect flexible
spending reimbursement  accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying under
Section 125 of the Code  (the " _Purchaser Cafeteria Plan_ "). The Purchaser
shall cause  the Purchaser Cafeteria Plan to accept a spin-off of the
flexible spending  reimbursement accounts of each Transferred Employee who
participates in a  cafeteria plan of the Seller (the " _Seller Cafeteria
Plan_ ") immediately  prior to the Closing Date (each, an " _FSA Participant_
") and to honor and  continue through December 31 of the year in which the
Closing occurs (the " _FSA Participation Period_ ") the elections made by
each FSA Participant  under the Seller Cafeteria Plan in respect of such
flexible spending  reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately
prior to the  Closing. As soon as practicable following the Closing Date,
the  Seller shall cause to be transferred from the Seller Cafeteria Plan to
the  Purchaser Cafeteria Plan the excess, if any, of the aggregate
accumulated  contributions to the flexible spending reimbursement accounts
made by  Transferred Employees prior to the Closing during the year in which
the Closing  occurs over the aggregate reimbursement payouts made to the
Transferred  Employees prior to the Closing for such year from such accounts.
From  and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume and be solely
responsible  for  all claims by Transferred Employees under the flexible
spending reimbursement  accounts of the Seller Cafeteria Plan incurred at any
time during the calendar  year in which the Closing Date occurs, whether
incurred prior to, on or after  the Closing Date, that have not been paid in
full as of the Closing  Date. For purposes of this paragraph, a claim for
reimbursement shall  be deemed to have been incurred on the date on which the
charge or expense  giving rise to such claim is incurred. Nothing herein
shall prevent  the Purchaser from amending, modifying or terminating the
Purchaser Cafeteria  Plan at any time after December 31 of the year in which
the Closing  occurs.

(m) Effective  as of the Closing, each Transferred Employee who is a
participant as of such  employee's Transfer Date in one or more Seller
Benefit Plans that is a U.S.  tax-qualified defined benefit pension plan (as
applicable, a " _Seller Pension  Plan_ ") shall cease accruing benefits under
such Seller Pension Plan and,  except as required by applicable Law or as set
forth in this  Section 5.08(m), service with any employer following such
employee's  Transfer Date shall not be taken into account for any purpose
under such  Seller  Pension Plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case
of any  Transferred Employee who is a participant in a Seller Pension Plan as
of  such  employee's Transfer Date but who has not satisfied the vesting
criteria or the  eligibility criteria to receive an unreduced retirement
benefit or an early  retirement subsidy under such plan as of such employee's
Transfer Date (each  such Transferred Employee, a " _Pension Service
Employee_ "), such Pension  Service Employee shall be given credit for
service with the Purchaser and  its  affiliates following the Closing solely
for purposes of vesting of benefits  and  eligibility for unreduced
retirement benefits and early retirement subsidies  under such Seller Pension
Plan. The Seller shall undertake to  identify each Pension Credit Employee
prior to the Closing and, promptly  following the Closing, the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser with a list  of  each Transferred Employee who the
Seller has identified as a Pension Service  Employee. Within 10 Business Days
following the termination of  employment of any Pension Service Employee
listed on the schedule for any  reason, the Purchaser shall provide the
Seller with a notice which specifies  the  date on which such Pension
Service Employee's employment terminated and the  circumstances of such
termination ( _i.e._ , whether such termination was due  to the employee's
voluntary resignation, death or disability or was a  termination by the
Purchaser or its affiliates with or without  cause). For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event will the Purchaser or  any of its affiliates be deemed to
sponsor or contribute to or have liability  under or with respect to any
Seller Pension Plan as a result of the recognition  of the service of any
Pension Seller Employee with the Purchaser or its  affiliates, in accordance
with this Section 5.08(m). Notwithstanding any  other  provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, following the Closing, the Seller  or its
affiliates shall retain, or shall cause the Seller Pension Plans to  retain,
all assets and liabilities that relate to benefits accrued by  Transferred
Employees prior to the Closing pursuant to the Seller Pension  Plans  and
shall make payments to Transferred Employees with vested rights thereunder 
in accordance with the terms of the applicable Seller Pension Plan as in 
effect  from time to time; _provided_ , _however_ , that except as required
by  law or the terms of the applicable Seller Pension Plan, as in effect
from  time  to time, no Transferred Employee shall be permitted to commence
receiving  benefits pursuant to any Seller Pension Plan until such
Transferred Employee's  employment with the Purchaser has terminated.

 

 

(n) The  Purchaser will assume the CBAs identified on _Section 5.08(n)_ of
the  Seller Letter effective as of the Closing (including the obligation to
honor  the  terms and conditions thereof and any obligations thereunder
requiring a  successor to recognize a particular labor union as authorized
representative  of  an employee group or for any other purpose) on terms and
conditions no less  favorable than those in effect on the date of this
Agreement. As of  the Closing Date, the Purchaser or one of its affiliates
shall be the "Employer" for purposes of each such CBA and the Purchaser and
its affiliates shall  have  sole responsibility for all obligations and
liabilities arising from and  after  12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date under
the CBAs, and shall indemnify and hold  harmless the Seller and its
affiliates with respect to the CBAs for actions  which occur after 12:01 a.m.
on the Closing Date.

(o) The  Seller and Purchaser intend that while ownership of the Transferred
Entities  will change as a result of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by  this Agreement, such transactions will not constitute a
complete or partial  withdrawal by the Seller or any Transferred Entity from
the IAM  Fund. For so long as the Purchaser or its affiliates are obligated
to  contribute to the IAM Fund pursuant to the applicable collective
bargaining  agreement, the Purchaser will be obligated to contribute to the
IAM Fund  for  substantially the same number of contribution base units for
which the Seller  and its affiliates had an obligation to contribute thereto
with respect to  the  Business Employees. If the Purchaser withdraws from
the IAM Fund in a  complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect
to operations covered  by the applicable collective bargaining agreement, the
Purchaser will be  liable  to the IAM Fund, it being understood that any
such liability would constitute  a  Transferred Liability with respect to
which the Seller would be entitled  to  indemnification from the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9.07.

 

 

(p) The  Seller shall provide to the Purchaser, no later than five calendar
days prior  to  the Closing Date, a list of all employees or former
employees of the Seller  who  have suffered an "employment loss" (as defined
in the WARN Act), during the  ninety calendar day period preceding 12:01 a.m.
on the Closing Date at each  "single site of employment" (as defined in WARN)
that relates to the Business  and the date of such employment loss and
applicable site of employment for  each  such person. If, from and after
12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date, the  Purchaser operates the Business of the
Seller in the same manner operated  by the  Seller during the six-month
period prior to the Closing Date, the Purchaser  will  not incur any
liability under WARN or any similar state or local  statute. Subject to the
foregoing representation, the Purchaser shall  indemnify and hold harmless
the Seller and its affiliates with respect to  any  liability under the WARN
Act or any similar state statute arising from the  actions of the Purchaser
or its affiliates from and after 12:01 a.m. on the  Closing Date.

 

 

(q) Effective  as of the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall establish or
otherwise have in  effect a defined contribution plan that includes a
qualified cash or deferred  arrangement within the meaning of Section 401(k)
of the Code (the " _Purchaser 401(k) Plan_") that will provide benefits to
Transferred  Employees participating in one or more defined contribution
plans of the  Seller  or its affiliates that include a cash or deferred
arrangement within the  meaning  of Section 401(k) of the Code (as
applicable, the " _Seller  401(k) Plan_"). Each Transferred Employee
participating in  the Seller 401(k) Plan as of such employee's Transfer Date
shall become a  participant in the Purchaser 401(k) Plan as of such
employee's Transfer  Date. The accounts of Transferred Employees under the
Seller  401(k) Plan shall be distributable according to the terms of the
Seller  401(k) Plan. Upon the Closing, the Seller shall fully vest (i)  all
Seller contributions to the Seller 401(k) Plan and (ii) any other U.S.  tax-
qualified and supplemental defined contribution plans in which Transferred 
Employees participate. The Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser  401(k) Plan
to accept "direct rollovers" (within the meaning of  Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code) of distributions from the Seller  401(k) Plan to Transferred
Employees (including direct rollovers of  outstanding loans and any
promissory notes or other documents evidencing  such  loans) if such
rollovers are elected in accordance with applicable Law by  such 
Transferred Employees during the one year period following the Transferred 
Employee's Transfer Date on terms mutually agreeable to the Seller and the 
Purchaser. The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with each  other (and
cause the trustees of the Seller 401(k) Plan and the Purchaser  401(k) Plan
to cooperate with each other) with respect to the rollover of  the
distributions to the Purchaser 401(k) Plan. During the  Continuation Period,
the Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser 401(k) Plan to  maintain for the
benefit of the 401(k) Covered Employees the level of employer  contributions
detailed in _Section 5.08(b)_ of the Seller  Letter. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Seller shall have no  responsibility for any failure of the
Purchaser to properly administer the  Purchaser 401(k) Plan in accordance
with its terms and applicable Law, including  without limitation any failure
to properly administer the accounts of  Transferred Employees and their
beneficiaries who have effected a direct  rollover of their account balances
from the Seller 401(k) Plan to the Purchaser  401(k) Plan, and the Purchaser
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller  and  its affiliates from all
costs, expenses or other damages that may result  to the  Seller and its
affiliates from any such failure.

(r) With  respect to the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, the
Seller shall  retain all liabilities, obligations and commitments for the
portion of any  annual cash bonuses that relate to the portion of such year
that elapses  prior  to the Closing Date. The Seller shall make a prorated
annual cash  bonus payment to each Transferred Employee the amount (if any)
of which shall  be  equal to the product of (i) the amount (if any, and as
determined in  accordance with the following sentence) that would have been
payable to such  Transferred Employee in respect of such employee's annual
cash bonus had such  Transferred Employee remained employed by the Seller for
the full calendar  year  (such amount with respect to each Transferred
Employee, the " _Annual Bonus  Amount_ ") multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the  number of days in the calendar year during which
the Closing occurs that  elapse  prior to the Closing, and the denominator
of which is 365. The Seller  shall determine the Annual Bonus Amount, if any,
for each Transferred Employee  using a good faith, reasonable methodology
(which need not be the same for  each  Transferred Employee) consistent with
past practice as to methodology (including  targets), including by basing
such amount upon target bonus or upon actual  performance. Such prorated
annual cash bonuses shall be paid not  later than 30 days following the
Closing Date.

 

 

(s) The  Seller has entered into a severance agreement with the Business
Employee  set  forth in _Section 5.08(s)(i)_ of the Seller  Letter.
Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause  its affiliates,
to assume and honor such employment agreement pursuant to  its  terms as in
effect on the Closing Date. On and following the Closing  Date, Purchaser or
one of its affiliates shall be deemed to be the employer  for  all purposes
pursuant to such severance agreement, _provided_ the Business  Employee
executes a written acknowledgement of the assumption of the severance 
agreement by the Purchaser. The Seller has also entered into a letter 
agreement regarding international assignment or relocation with each of the 
Business Employees set forth in Section 5.08(s)(ii) of the Seller  Letter.
Effective as of the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall  cause its
affiliates, to assume and honor each such letter agreement pursuant  to  its
terms as in effect on the Closing Date.

(t) The  Seller has entered into a change in control severance agreement with
the  Business Employee set forth in _Section 5.08(t)_ of the Seller  Letter.
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller will take all  such actions (if
any) as are necessary to cause, in a manner that does not  create any
obligation upon or liability of the Purchaser or any Transferred  Entity,
such Business Employee to have no further rights pursuant to such  change 
in control severance agreement.

 

 

(u) Notwithstanding  Section 5.08(b) or any other provision of this Agreement
to the contrary,  if the applicable Laws of any country or any collective
bargaining agreements  require the Purchaser or its affiliates (i) to
maintain the same Terms and  Conditions of Employment (as defined below) that
relate to any Transferred  Employee following such employee's Transfer Date
or (ii) to continue or  cause to be continued any employment contract of any
Transferred Employee  that  is required under any applicable non-U.S. law
and described on  _Section 5.08(u)_ of the Seller Letter, in the case of 
clauses (i) and (ii), the Purchaser shall maintain, or cause to the 
maintained, the same Terms and Conditions of Employment that relate to such 
Transferred Employee or shall continue, or cause to be continued, such 
Transferred Employee's employment contract for the period required under 
applicable Law or by the applicable collective bargaining  agreements. "
_Terms and Conditions of Employment_ " shall mean  the rights of Transferred
Employees according to their individual terms and  conditions of employment
with the Seller and its affiliates prior to the  relevant Transfer Date and,
where applicable, under collective bargaining  agreements.

 

 

(v) From  and  after the Closing, the Purchaser and the Transferred Entities
shall, jointly  and  severally, indemnify the Seller against, and hold each
of them harmless from,  any Loss suffered or incurred by the Seller (without
duplication for  (i) any indemnification provided for in Section 9.01(b)
and  (ii) any indemnification that may be sought under more than one clause
of  Section 9.07) arising from, relating to or otherwise in respect of any 
discontinuance, suspension or modification on or after the Closing of any 
Assumed Benefit Plan.

 

 

(w) Prior  to  the Closing, the Purchaser and its representatives shall be
given reasonable  advance notice of and shall have the right to be present at
and participate  in  any meetings or negotiations relating to transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement with any union or similar organized labor
group representing Business  Employees (it being agreed that the Seller shall
be the spokesperson at any  such  meetings or negotiations).

 

 

SECTION  5.09. _Access  to Information._ (a) To the extent consistent with 
applicable Law, the Seller shall, and shall cause the Business to, afford  to
the  Purchaser and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
(including  surveyors) reasonable access, upon reasonable notice during
normal business  hours during the period prior to the Closing, to all the
personnel, properties,  books, Contracts, commitments, Tax Returns and
records of the Business, and,  during such period, shall furnish promptly to
the Purchaser any information  concerning the Business and its assets as the
Purchaser may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such access
(a) shall not permit the  Purchaser to perform environmental studies in
respect of the Business or  its  assets and (b) does not unreasonably
disrupt the normal operations of the  Seller or the Business.

(b) The  Seller will retain all books and records (other than the books and
records  transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement) relating to
the  Business in accordance with the Seller's record retention policies as
currently  in effect. During the six-year period beginning on the Closing
Date,  the Seller shall not dispose of or permit the disposal of any such
books  and  records not required to be retained under such policies without
first giving  60  days' prior written notice to the Purchaser offering to
surrender the same to  the Purchaser at the Purchaser's expense.

financial institutions, in amounts  and  on terms reasonably satisfactory to

Seller or its affiliates;  _provided_ that the Purchaser and its affiliates
shall not be prohibited  from making general solicitations of employment that
are not specifically  targeted at Remaining Employees.

 

 

(d) Section 6.01(a)  shall be deemed not breached as a result of the
acquisition following the  Closing Date and subsequent ownership by the
Seller or any of its affiliates  of  a person that engages, directly or
indirectly, in Competitive Activities  if such  Competitive Activities
account for less than 20% of such person's consolidated  annual revenues and
earnings; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such  acquired person shall be
permitted to use the names "Olin Metals" or "Olin  Brass" or any other name
that in the reasonable opinion of the Purchaser is  confusingly similar to
the names "Olin Metals" or "Olin Brass" (it being  understood that nothing in
this Section 6.01(d) shall be deemed to restrict  the  use of the name Olin
in any corporate name).

 

 

(e) It  is the  desire and intent of the parties to this Agreement that the
provisions of  Section 6.01(a) shall be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under  the laws and public policies applied in each jurisdiction
in which enforcement  is sought. It is expressly understood and agreed that
although the  Seller and the Purchaser consider the provisions of Section
6.01(a) to be  reasonable, if a judicial determination is made by a court of
competent  jurisdiction that the time or territory or any other restriction
contained  in  this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against the
Seller, the  provisions of this Agreement shall not be rendered void but
shall be deemed  amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and
to such maximum  extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to
be  enforceable. If any particular provisions or portion of  Section 6.01(a)
shall be adjudicated to be unenforceable, the amendment  contemplated by the
immediately preceding sentence shall apply only with  respect  to the
operation of such Section in the particular jurisdiction in which  such
adjudication is made.

 

 

(f) The  parties recognize that the performance of the obligations  under
Section 6.01(a) by the Seller is special, unique and  extraordinary in
character, and that in the event of the breach by Seller  of the  terms and
conditions of Section 6.01(a) to be performed by Seller, the  Purchaser and
its affiliates shall be entitled, if they so elect, to obtain  damages for
any breach, or to enforce the specific performance thereof by  the  Seller.

 

 

SECTION  6.02. _Confidentiality._   (a) The Purchaser acknowledges that the
information being provided to  it in connection with the Acquisition, the
Financing and the consummation  of the  other transactions contemplated
hereby is subject to the terms of the  confidentiality agreement dated as of
May 16, 2007 (the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ "), between KPS Capital
Partners and the Seller, the terms of which  are incorporated herein by
reference. Effective upon, and only upon,  the Closing, the Confidentiality
Agreement shall terminate with respect to  information relating to the
Business.

subsidiaries  and its and their advisors, consultants, employees and agents

issue any such press release or make any such public statement  prior to such
consultation, except as such party may reasonably conclude  may be  required
by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any  listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities 
quotation system. The parties agree that the initial press release to  be
issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement 
shall  be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties.

 

 

SECTION  6.04. _Connecticut  Property Transfer Law; Pre-Closing

Acquisition and any other  transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(b) continue to be  responsible for the Pre-Closing Environmental Matters.
The Seller  shall not be obligated under this Section 6.04 to perform
investigative or  remedial action (a) at levels more stringent than
industrial cleanup  standards or other applicable minimum standards,
including environmental  land  use restrictions, or (b) at costs greater
than those reasonably necessary  to bring a condition into compliance with
Environmental Law or to satisfy  the  requirements of a Governmental Entity.
The Seller shall be a  Controlling Party within the meaning of Section
9.09(d) with respect to any  actions (including any litigation, remedial
action or negotiation and the  scope  and timing thereof) in connection with
its obligations under this  Section 6.04. In accordance with the
Environmental Access  Agreement, after the Closing, the Purchaser shall
provide to the Seller access  to any facilities subject to the CPTL and any
other facilities related to  the  Pre-Closing Environmental Matters.

 

 

SECTION  6.05. _Use  of  Names Following the Closing; Supplies._ (a) To 
the extent necessary, promptly following the Closing, the Purchaser shall 
cause  each Transferred Entity to change its corporate name to a name not

similar to "Olin". Except as permitted pursuant to the Trademark License 
Agreement, from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser and its affiliates 
(including the Transferred Entities) shall not use the name "Olin" or any
other  name that, in the reasonable judgment of the Seller, is confusingly

SECTION  6.06. _Export  Licenses._ The Purchaser and the Seller shall, and

of the Business  to be  transferred to the Purchaser or its designees as
promptly as practicable  after  the Closing. Prior to the transfer of such
export licenses and other  authorizations to the Purchaser or its designees,

products if such export would  violate ITAR.

of any Uncollectible Account for  which the Seller has indemnified the
Purchaser or any of its affiliates,  the  Purchaser shall, and shall cause
such affiliates to, pay over to the Seller  an  amount equal to the
indemnity payment made by the Seller.

 

 

SECTION  6.09. _Post-Closing  Cooperation._ (a) The Purchaser, on the one
hand, and  the Seller, on the other hand, shall cooperate with each other,
and shall  cause  their affiliates and their officers, employees, agents,
auditors and  representatives to cooperate with each other, after the Closing
to facilitate  the orderly transition of the Business to the Purchaser after
the Closing  and to  minimize any disruption to the Business that might
result from the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. After the
Closing, upon reasonable  written notice, the Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Seller, on the other  hand, shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the
other and the other's  affiliates and their officers, employees, counsel,
auditors and representatives  access, during normal business hours, to such
books, records, manuals and other  information and assistance relating to the
Business (to the extent within  the  control of such party) as is reasonably
necessary for financial reporting,  accounting and Tax matters or other
reasonable purposes.

purpose.

connection with obtaining the permits,  approvals, authorizations and
consents set forth on Section 6.11 of the Seller  Letter (the " _Material

(c) Notwithstanding  any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
(i) if the Purchaser  becomes obligated to pay the Sponsor Termination Fee in
accordance with  Section 8.02(b) and the Purchaser is not in breach of this
Agreement such  that (but for the Purchaser's failure to satisfy its
obligations under  Section 1.01) the conditions set forth in Section 7.03(a)
and 7.03(b)  would otherwise be satisfied (other than receipt of the
certificates referred  to  therein) (any such event, a " _Non-Breach
Financing Failure_ "), and provided  the Seller is not in breach of its
obligations under this Agreement such  that  the conditions set forth in
Sections 7.02(a) and 7.02(b) are satisfied (other  than receipt of the
certificates referred to therein), then the Seller's  termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(a)(v) and the  receipt of payment of the
Sponsor Termination Fee pursuant to paragraph  (b) of this Section 8.02 shall
be the sole and exclusive legal or  equitable remedy of the Seller and its
subsidiaries against the Purchaser  and  any of its former, current or
future general or limited partners, members  or  stockholders or against any
of their former, current or future directors,  officers, employees,
affiliates, general or limited partners, stockholders,  managers, members or
agents (each a " _Specified Person_ ") for any Losses  suffered as a result
of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant  or  agreement
contained in this Agreement or the failure of the Acquisition to  be 
consummated, and upon payment of the Sponsor Termination Fee in accordance 
with  paragraph (b) of this Section 8.02, none of the Specified Persons 
shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out 
of  this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
other  than  for fraud and (ii) in no event if the Closing does not occur,
whether or  not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Seller
and its  subsidiaries, as a group, on the one hand, or the Specified Persons,
as a  group,  on the other hand, be liable for any Losses relating to or
arising out of  this  Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in excess of  $20,000,000 in the aggregate for each such group
(inclusive of any obligation  to  pay the Sponsor Termination Fee), it being
agreed that, except as provided  in  Section 10.10, payment of such amount
shall be the sole and exclusive legal  or  equitable remedy available to a
party in the event that the Closing does  not  occur, and none of the
Seller, its subsidiaries or any Specified  Person shall have any further
liability or obligation relating to or arising  out  of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, other  than  for fraud. The
parties acknowledge and agree that nothing in this  Section shall be deemed
to affect their right to specific performance to  the extent set forth in
Section 10.10.

 

 

(d) The  Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and agree that (i) the
agreements  contained in this Section 8.02 are an integral part of the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) without these agreements,
neither the  Purchaser nor the Seller would have entered into this Agreement
and  (iii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under 
circumstances where the Sponsor Termination Fee is payable are uncertain 
and  incapable of accurate calculation and the amounts payable pursuant to
paragraph  (b) of this Section 8.02 are reasonable forecasts of the actual 
damages which may be incurred and constitute liquidated damages and not a 
penalty.

(e) If  the  Purchaser fails to pay the Sponsor Termination Fee due pursuant
to paragraph  (b)  of this Section 8.02 when due, and, in order to obtain
such payment, the  Seller commences a suit, action or other proceeding that
results in a judgment  against the Purchaser, the Purchaser shall pay to the
Seller its costs and  expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit,  action or other proceeding, together with
interest on the Sponsor Termination  Fee from (and including) the date such
payment was required to be made through  (but not including) the date of
payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A.  in  effect on the date such
payment was required to be made; _provided_ that  this paragraph (e) shall
not be construed to limit the rights of any party  to seek prejudgment
interest on damages assessed against the other party  subject  to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.02(c) and  Section 10.10.

 

 

SECTION  8.03. _Amendments  and Waivers._ This Agreement may not be amended
except by an  instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.
By an  instrument in writing the Purchaser, on the one hand, or the Seller,
on the  other hand, may waive compliance by the other with any term or
provision  of this  Agreement that such other party was or is obligated to
comply with or  perform. Any such waiver shall only be effective in the
specific  instance and for the specific and limited purpose for which it was
given  and  shall not be deemed a waiver of any other provision of this
Agreement or  of the  same breach or default upon any recurrence thereof. No
failure on the  part of any party to exercise and no delay in exercising any
right hereunder  shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise  of  any right hereunder preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the  exercise of any other right.

hold them harmless from any Losses arising  from, relating to or otherwise in

the Closing  Date  (a " _Straddle Period_ "):

 

 

(i) real,  personal and intangible property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") of
the Business  for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax  Period  on a _pro rata_ basis (based on the number of days
during such taxable  period elapsed on or prior to the Closing Date). If at
the time of  Closing, the tax rate or the assessed valuation for the year in
which the  Closing occurs has not yet been fixed, Property Taxes shall be
prorated based  upon the tax rate and the assessed valuation established for

and  9.03(i).

Agreement shall survive  the Closing as follows: (a) the representations and

(b) For  purposes of calculating the amount of any Loss in connection with a
claim  by any  Purchaser Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee with respect to a
breach of any  representation or warranty made by the Seller or the
Purchaser, as the case  may  be, for which indemnification is sought
pursuant to this Article IX (but  not for purposes of determining whether
such a breach has occurred), all  "material adverse effect" and other
materiality references in the  representations and warranties set forth in
Article II, Article III  and Article IV, as applicable, shall be disregarded.

 

 

SECTION  9.06. _Exclusive  Monetary Remedy; Consequential Damages; Nature of
Payments; No Duplicate  Recovery; Access Rights._ (a) Except as otherwise 
specifically provided in this Agreement or in the Transition Services
Agreement,  the Winchester Supply Agreement, the Environmental Access
Agreement or the  Trademark License Agreement, the Purchaser and the Seller
acknowledge that  their  exclusive monetary remedy after the Closing with
respect to any claims relating  to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the  Business and its assets and
liabilities (other than for fraud) shall be pursuant  to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this  Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing,
each of the  Purchaser and the Seller, for itself and its affiliates
(including the  Transferred Entities), waives, from and after the Closing, to
the fullest  extent  permitted under applicable Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of  action  (other than claims of, or causes of action
arising from, fraud) for monetary  damages it may have against the other or
its affiliates arising under this  Agreement, any document or certificate

retained or assumed under this  Agreement except to the extent such damages
are an element of a Third Party  Claim against the Purchaser, any Transferred
Entity or the Seller which is  the  object of indemnification hereunder.

(c) Notwithstanding  any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
no indemnified party  shall be entitled to indemnification under this Article
IX with respect to  any Loss to the extent that such Loss was reflected in
the calculation of  the  adjustment to Purchase Price pursuant to Section
1.05.

 

 

(d) Each  party shall, and shall cause each of their subsidiaries to, afford
to the  other  party and its accountants, counsel and other representatives
reasonable access,  upon reasonable notice during normal business hours, to
relevant personnel  knowledgeable of, and properties, books and records of
their respective  businesses reasonably related to, the nature and the amount
of Losses for  which  indemnification is being, or was sought, from it
pursuant to clause (c) or  (g) of Section 9.02.

 

 

SECTION  9.07. _Indemnification  by the Purchaser._ From and after the
Closing, the Purchaser and  the Transferred Entities shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify the Seller  Indemnitees against, and hold each of them
harmless from, any Loss suffered  or  incurred by the Seller Indemnities
(without duplication for (i) any  indemnification provided for in Section
9.01(b) and (ii) any  indemnification that may be sought under more than one
clause of this  Section 9.07) arising from, relating to or otherwise in
respect  of:

 

 

(a) any  breach of any representation or warranty of the Purchaser contained
in  Article IV of this Agreement or in any certificate delivered by the 
Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement;

 

 

(b) any  breach of any covenant of Purchaser contained in this Agreement;

 

 

(c) any  Transferred Liability, including the obligation of the Purchaser to
indemnify  the Seller pursuant to Sections 9.03(e) and 9.03(i); or

 

 

(d) any  fees,  costs, expenses or other payments incurred or owed by the
Purchaser or any  of  its affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities)
to any agent, broker,  financial advisor, investment banker or other person
that is or will be entitled  to any broker's or finder's fee or any other
commission or similar fee in  connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement.

 

 

SECTION  9.08. _Calculation  of Losses._ The amount of any Loss for which
indemnification is  provided under this Article IX (other than Losses under
Sections 9.02(c)  and (g)) shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by
the Purchaser  or its  subsidiaries under insurance policies with respect to
such Loss. The  amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided
under this  Article IX shall be (a) increased to take account of any net Tax
cost  incurred by the indemnified party arising from the receipt of indemnity
payments  hereunder (grossed up for such increase) and (b) reduced to take
account of  any net Tax benefit actually realized by the indemnified party
arising from  the  incurrence or payment of any such Loss in the year of
such Loss or any other  year preceding or including the date on which the
indemnity payment is made  or  any taxable year within five taxable years
after the taxable year in which  such  Loss occurs. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 9.08, in  any case where the Purchaser or its
subsidiaries recovers from third parties  any  amount in respect of a matter
with respect to which an indemnifying party  has  indemnified it pursuant to
this Article IX, such indemnified party shall  promptly pay over to the
indemnifying party the amount so recovered (after  deducting therefrom the
full amount of the expenses incurred by it in procuring  such recovery), but
not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the  indemnifying party to
or on behalf of the indemnified party in respect of  such  matter.

SECTION  9.09. _Procedures._ (a) _Third  Party Claims_. (i) In order for a
person (the " _indemnified party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for  under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07 in respect of, arising out
of or  involving a claim made by any person against the indemnified party (a
" _Third  Party Claim_ "), such indemnified party must notify the
indemnifying party in  writing (and in reasonable detail) of the Third Party
Claim promptly following  receipt by such indemnified party of notice of the
Third Party Claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such
notification shall  not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except
and only to the  extent  the indemnifying party shall have been prejudiced
as a result of such failure  (except that the indemnifying party shall not be
liable for any expenses  incurred during the period in which the indemnified
party failed to give  such  notice). Thereafter, the indemnified party shall
deliver to the  indemnifying party, promptly following the indemnified
party's receipt thereof,  copies of all notices and documents (including
court papers) received by  the  indemnified party relating to the Third
Party Claim.

 

 

(ii) If  a  Third Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying  party  shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof
and, if it so chooses,  to assume the defense thereof by written notice to
the indemnified party  within  45 days of the receipt of the notice received
pursuant to  Section 9.09(a)(i) with counsel selected by the indemnifying
party;  _provided_ that such counsel is not reasonably objected to by the 
indemnified party; _provided_ , _further_ , that notwithstanding the 
foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to assume control 
of  such defense and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel 
(reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party) retained by the
indemnified  party if (A) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises
in  connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegations  or  investigation, (B) the claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief  against the indemnified party; (C) the indemnifying party
failed or is  failing to reasonably prosecute or defend such claim, or (D) if
the  claim is subject to the Cap, (1) amounts remaining under the Cap are
$2,000,000  or less and (2) such claim together with all outstanding and
unresolved claims  that are subject to the Cap could reasonably be expected
to give rise to  Losses  which are more than twice the remaining amount
indemnifiable by such  indemnifying party with respect to such claims
pursuant to this  Article IX. Should the indemnifying party be entitled and
so  elect to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the indemnifying
party  shall  not be liable to the indemnified party for any legal expenses
subsequently  incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the
defense  thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense in
accordance  with this Agreement, the indemnified party shall have the right
to participate  in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own
expense, separate  from  the counsel employed by the indemnifying party, it
being understood that  the  indemnifying party shall control such defense.
The indemnifying party  shall be liable for the fees, costs and expenses of
counsel employed by the  indemnified party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has  not  assumed the defense thereof (other than during
any period in which the  indemnified party shall have failed to give notice
of the Third Party Claim  as  provided above) and with respect to any Third
Party Claim where the indemnifying  party was prohibited from assuming such
defense pursuant to this  Section 9.09. If the indemnifying party chooses to
defend or  prosecute a Third Party Claim, all the indemnified parties shall
cooperate  in  the defense or prosecution thereof. Such cooperation shall
include  the retention and (upon the indemnifying party's request) the
provision to the  indemnifying party of records and information that are
reasonably relevant  to  such Third Party Claim, and making employees
available on a mutually convenient  basis to provide additional information
and explanation of any material provided  hereunder. No party shall admit
(except as required by Law) any  liability with respect to, or compromise,
settle or discharge, any Third  Party  Claim without the prior written
consent of the other party; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if such admission
of liability, settlement, compromise  or  discharge does not subject the
Purchaser Indemnitees to any remedy (other  than  the payment of money) and
provides for the full and unconditional release  of the  Purchaser
Indemnitees from all liability in connection with such Third Party  Claim,
then, at the request of the Seller, the Purchaser Indemnitees shall  agree 
to such admission of liability, settlement, compromise or discharge as long 
as  the Seller pays in full the amounts payable in connection with such
admission  of  liability, settlement, compromise or discharge. All claims
under  Section 9.02 or Section 9.07 other than Third Party Claims shall be 
governed by Section 9.09(b).

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding  the foregoing, in respect of any Third Party Claim for
which indemnification  is  sought pursuant to Section 9.03(e) or Section
9.03(i), the parties  agree that the defense of any such Third Party Claim
shall be jointly controlled  and administered by the Purchaser and the Seller
and that no such Third Party  Claim shall be settled, compromised or
discharged without the consent of  the  Purchaser and the Seller, not to be
unreasonably withheld.

 

 

(b) _Other  Claims_. If any indemnified party should have a claim against
any  indemnifying party under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07 that does not 
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected 
from such indemnified party, the indemnified party shall promptly deliver 
notice  of such claim to the indemnifying party after obtaining knowledge of
such  claim. The failure by any indemnified party so to notify the 
indemnifying party shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any
liability  that it may have to such indemnified party under Section 9.02 or 
Section 9.07, except to the extent that the indemnifying party shall have 
been prejudiced by such failure. If the indemnifying party does not  notify
the indemnified party within 45 calendar days following its receipt  of such
notice that the indemnifying party disputes its liability to the  indemnified
party under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07, such claim  specified by the
indemnified party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed  a  liability
of the indemnifying party under Section 9.02 or Section 9.07  and the
indemnifying party shall pay the amount of such liability to the  indemnified
party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount  of  the
claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on such later date when  the 
amount of such claim (or such portion thereof) becomes finally  determined.

(c) _Procedures  Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims._

 

 

(i) Promptly  after a party (the " _Tax Indemnified Party_ ") becomes aware
of the  existence of a Tax issue that may give rise to an indemnification
claim under  Section 9.01 (a " _Tax Controversy_ ") by it against the other
party  (the " _Tax Indemnifying Party_ "), the Tax Indemnified Party shall
notify  the Tax Indemnifying Party of the Tax issue and thereafter shall
promptly  forward to the Tax Indemnifying Party copies of the relevant
portion of any  notice or other document received from any Taxing Authority
and communications  with any Taxing Authority relating to such Tax
Controversy; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a failure to give such notice
will not affect such  other  party's rights to indemnification under this
Article IX, except to the  extent that such party is actually prejudiced
thereby. Any  out-of-pocket expenses incurred in handling, settling or
contesting a Tax  Controversy shall be borne by the Tax Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(ii) Except  as  otherwise provided in this Section 9.09(c)(ii), after the
Closing Date,  (except in the case of any Tax Controversy relating to a Tax
Return of any  consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the
Transferred Entities  were  members, (a " _Pre-Closing Consolidated Return_
")), the Purchaser shall  control the conduct, through counsel of its own
choosing, of any Tax Controversy  with respect to any of the Transferred
Entities. In the case of a  Contest after the Closing Date that relates
solely to Taxes for which the  Purchaser is indemnified under 9.01(a)
(including any Pre-Closing Consolidated  Returns), the Seller may elect to
control the handling, settling or contesting  of any such Tax Controversy,
but the Purchaser shall have the right to  participate in such Tax
Controversy (except in the case of a Tax Controversy  that relates to a Pre-
Closing Consolidated Return) at its own  expense. The Seller shall not
settle, compromise and/or concede any  portion of such Tax Controversy
(except in the case of a Tax Controversy  that  relates to a Pre-Closing
Consolidated Return) without obtaining the Purchaser's  written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed  or  conditioned.
In the case of a Tax Controversy that relates both to  Taxes for which
Purchaser is indemnified under Section 9.01(a) and Taxes  for which Seller is
indemnified under 9.01(b), the Purchaser shall control  the  conduct of such
Tax Controversy, but the Seller shall have the right to  participate in such
Tax Controversy at its own expense, and the Purchaser  shall  not settle,
compromise and/or concede such Tax Controversy without the consent  of the
Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed  or 
conditioned. The Tax Indemnifying Party shall keep the Tax  Indemnified Party
reasonably informed as to the progress of any Tax proceeding  with respect to
a Tax Controversy to the extent such Tax proceeding relates  to  Taxes
payable by or with respect to the Transferred Entities or Transferred  Assets
and shall consider in good faith any written comments or suggestions 
regarding such Tax proceeding from the Tax Indemnified Party.

(d) Procedures  Relating to Indemnification for Environmental Matters.

 

 

(i) Upon  any  indemnified party becoming aware of any claim, the occurrence
of any event,  or  the existence of any of facts, in respect of which such
indemnified party  will  bring, or may seek to bring, an indemnification
claim under this Agreement  arising out of or relating to any violation of,
or liability pursuant to,  any  Environmental Law, the indemnified party
will provide written notice (each,  an " _Environmental Claim Notice_ ") to
the indemnifying party within 30 days of  the indemnified party becoming
aware of any claim, event or fact described  above; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that failure to give such notification  shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent  the  indemnifying party shall have
been prejudiced as a result of such  failure.

 

 

(ii) After  receipt of an Environmental Claim Notice, the indemnifying party
shall have  the  right, but not the obligation, to control the defense, or
investigate or  remediate any condition relating to the subject matter of
such Environmental  Claim Notice (the " _Environmental Matter_ "); _provided_
that if after  60 days of receipt of such Environmental Claim Notice the
indemnifying party  does not notify the indemnified party that it intends to
exercise such right,  then the indemnified party may control such defense.

 

 

(iii) The  party  that controls the defense, investigation or remediation of
an Environmental  Matter (the " _Controlling Party_ ") shall (A) keep the

meanings when used in any Annex, Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement or 
any  certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto,
unless  otherwise defined therein. Any agreement, instrument or statute 
defined or referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute 
as  from time to time amended, supplemented or modified, including (x) (in

EXHIBIT  G

 

 

 

_Arrangements  Pending Subdivision of Real Property; Easements_

 

 

As "Owned  Property" includes portions of the Seller's East Alton, Illinois
facility (the " _East Alton Facility_ "; the portion of the East Alton
Facility that is  Owned Property is referred to as the " _Transferable East
Alton Real  Property_ " and the portion of the East Alton Facility that is
not Owned  Property is referred to as the " _Excluded East Alton Real
Property_ "), it  is the intent of the parties that the Transferable East
Alton Real Property  be  subdivided (at the Purchaser's sole cost and
expense) whether pursuant to formal  subdivision procedures required by local
Law or possibly accomplished as  an  informal subdivision permitted under
local Law, in either case so as to have  the  East Alton Owned Real Property
constitute one or more separate tax lots distinct  from the Excluded East
Alton Real Property. Such subdivision, whether  by formal subdivision
procedure or other informal subdivision procedure  permitted under local Law,
resulting in the establishment of the East Alton  Owned Real Property as one
or more separate tax lots is referred to as the  " _Subdivision_ ". The cost
of any improvements, alterations or  additions legally required to be made on
the Transferable East Alton Real  Property in order to accomplish the
Subdivision, as reasonably agreed to  by the  Purchaser and the Seller,
shall be equally borne by the Purchaser, on the  one  hand, and the Seller,
on the other hand.

 

 

The  Seller has advised the Purchaser that it is unlikely that the
Subdivision  can be  accomplished prior to the Closing. However, the Seller
shall use  commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate the Subdivision
prior to Closing  in a manner reasonably agreed to by the Purchaser and the
Seller;  _provided_ that, notwithstanding any provision in the Purchase
Agreement  dated as of October 15, 2007 (the " _Purchase Agreement_ "),
between the  Purchaser and the Seller to the contrary (including Sections
1.01 and 1.04(a)  of  the Purchase Agreement), the failure to accomplish the
Subdivision prior  to the  Closing and the consequent inability of the
Seller to convey fee ownership  of  the Transferable East Alton Real
Property or any circumstances resulting  therefrom shall not, absent the
failure of the Seller to so use commercially  reasonable efforts, constitute
a material adverse effect on the Purchaser,  on  the Seller or on the
Business, a breach of any representation, warranty,  covenant or agreement
under the Purchase Agreement or any certificate delivered  pursuant to the
Purchase Agreement or a failure of any condition under the  Purchase
Agreement.

 

 

If  the  Subdivision has not been accomplished prior to the Closing for any
reason,  at  the Closing:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

   

 

 

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

1. The  Seller shall lease all of the land of the Transferable East Alton Real Property  to the Purchaser pursuant to a triple net lease (the " _East Alton Lease_ ")  which shall be for a term of 99 years at a fixed annual rent of $1 per  year. The East Alton Lease shall contain a covenant by the Seller, in  its capacity as landlord thereunder, that the Seller's interest in the East  Alton Lease and the Seller's fee ownership of the land of the Transferable East  Alton Real Property shall remain vested in the Seller or one of its subsidiaries  during the term of the East Alton Lease. The East Alton Lease shall,  with respect to the Purchaser, in its capacity as tenant thereunder, to the  extent not set forth in this Exhibit G, impose upon the Purchaser all the  obligations, and afford the Purchaser all the rights, with respect to the  land  of the Transferable East Alton Real Property as would customarily be found  in a  triple net lease. The East Alton Lease shall afford the Purchaser  free and unrestricted rights of assignment, subletting, alteration, use,  development and all other rights with respect to the Transferable East Alton  Real Property and the leasehold interest therein, the intent being that the  Purchaser shall be the beneficial and economic owner of the land of the  Transferable East Alton Real Property, and shall have all rights and obligations  accruing with respect to the Transferable East Alton Real Property, except  for  the fact that record title to the land thereof will be held by the Seller  or one  of its subsidiaries. The Seller shall also covenant in the East Alton  Lease not to mortgage or otherwise encumber the land of the Transferable  East  Alton Real Property or any residual interest that the Seller may have in  and to  any Improvements. The East Alton Lease shall further provide that,  from and after the Closing, the Purchaser and its subsidiaries shall, jointly  and severally, indemnify the Seller Indemnitees against, and hold each of  them  harmless from, any Loss suffered or incurred by the Seller Indemnities arising  from, relating to or otherwise in respect of its ownership of the land of  the  Transferable East Alton Real Property after the Closing Date (including as  a  result of the actions or omissions of the Purchaser or its affiliates,  contractors, agents or invitees), other than Losses for which Seller indemnifies  the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.02 of the  Agreement. The East Alton Lease shall not be terminable for any  reason whatsoever (other than a taking by eminent domain of all of the  Transferable East Alton Real Property).

 

 

2. The  Seller shall, at the Closing, convey to the Purchaser fee title to all buildings  and improvements (and all fixtures, equipment and machinery forming part  thereof) located on the Transferable East Alton Real Property (collectively,  as  the same may be altered, added to, replaced or otherwise modified, the " _Improvements_ "). The Seller shall, at the Closing, execute a  non-warranty deed (and all required Transfer Tax forms as may be necessary  to  enable the deed to be placed of record) conveying title to the Improvements  to  the Purchaser. All Transfer Taxes and recording fees in connection  with such conveyance shall be shared equally, by the Purchaser, on the one  hand,  and the Seller, on the other hand.

 

 

During  the term of the East Alton Lease, the Purchaser shall be responsible
for  the  performance of all repairs and maintenance of the Transferable
East Alton  Real  Property (the land and the Improvements) and shall observe
and perform all  obligations under the East Alton Lease.

Table  of Contents

 

 

 

 

 

The  Purchaser shall have the right at any time during the term of the East
Alton  Lease to proceed to accomplish the Subdivision at the Purchaser's cost
and  expense. At the Purchaser's request, the Seller shall cooperate with 
the Purchaser to accomplish the Subdivision; _provided_ that such requested 
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of 
the  Seller and its subsidiaries. Upon the Subdivision being approved, the 
Seller shall execute a non-warranty deed (and all required Transfer Tax
forms  as  may be necessary to enable the deed to be placed of record)
conveying title  to  the land of the Transferable East Alton Real Property
to the  Purchaser. All Transfer Taxes and recording fees in connection with 
such conveyance shall be shared equally, by the Purchaser, on the one hand, 
and  the Seller, on the other hand.

 

 

From  and  after the Closing, upon the request of either party, the other
party shall  grant  any easement or right of way that is necessary (in the
reasonable judgment  of  the parties) for the continued operation of the
business of such party and  its  subsidiaries (consistent with the level,
manner and type of usage as of the  Closing Date); _provided_ that the
foregoing shall not require the granting  of any easement or right of way if
such easement or right of way would  unreasonably disrupt the normal
operation of the granting party or its  affiliates.
