(e) The Seller and the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company's

Purchase Price exceeds $325,000,000, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser and

$325,000,000, the Purchaser and the Seller shall discuss in good faith other
methods as shall be mutually agreeable to the Purchaser and the Seller (such
agreement not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of reducing
the Closing Date Purchase Price to such amount. The Purchaser agrees that
those methods will include, at the Seller's election, the purchase of existing
coal inventory by the Seller or one of its Affiliates immediately prior to
Closing at the spot market price to the extent necessary to reduce the Closing
Date Purchase Price to $325,000,000, with the provision that the purchased
inventory will be stored separately at the mine where the inventory is located
at the time of sale and will be maintained there under a separate contractual
arrangement to be entered into by the Purchaser and the Seller (or its
Affiliate), which will include the reimbursement of the Purchaser's reasonable
handling charges and any necessary or advisable measures to protect the
Seller's (or its Affiliate's) interest in the purchased inventory, including a
security interest therein; provided that no such purchase of inventory by the
Seller or its Affiliate shall be permitted to the extent it would cause the
condition set forth in Section 7.2(d) to fail to be satisfied.

Section 2.4 shall be prepared in accordance with the Working Capital and Net
Plant Value Methodology.

  

  

(e) Final Balance Sheet. On the Closing Date and promptly following the
Closing, representatives of the Purchaser and Seller shall jointly survey,
measure and calculate the coal inventory using the inventory methodology set
forth on Annex I, which coal inventory calculation shall be used in
determining the Proposed Net Working Capital. Within 90 days following the
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a notice
(an "Adjustment Notice"), which shall include a consolidated balance sheet of
the Company as of the Closing Date prepared in accordance with GAAP and the
methodologies specified in Annexes I, II and III (the "Proposed Balance Sheet"
and, in its final and binding form after resolution of any disputes pursuant
to this Section 2.4, the "Final Balance Sheet") setting forth its calculation
of (i) the Cash of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date
(the "Proposed Cash Amount", and, in its final and binding form after
resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 2.4, the "Final Cash
Amount"), (ii) the Indebtedness of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the
Closing Date that was not paid by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 2.3(c) or
previously satisfied prior to the Closing (the "Proposed Indebtedness Amount",
and, in its final and binding form after resolution of any disputes pursuant
to this Section 2.4, the "Final Indebtedness Amount"), (iii) the Closing Date
Net Working Capital (the "Proposed Net Working Capital", and, in its final and
binding form after resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 2.4,
the "Final Net Working Capital"), and (iv) the Closing Date Net Plant Value
(the "Proposed Net Plant Value", and, in its final and binding form after
resolution of any disputes pursuant to this Section 2.4, the "Final Net Plant
Value"), together with the calculations utilized in, and the supporting
documentation for the preparation of the Proposed Balance Sheet, the
calculation of the Proposed Net Working Capital and the calculation of the
Proposed Net Plant Value. The Seller shall have a period of 60 days (the
"Objection Period") after delivery of the Adjustment Notice in which to
request additional information which shall be promptly provided by the
Purchaser and to provide written notice to the Purchaser of any objections to
the Proposed Balance Sheet and the calculation thereof (the "Objection
Notice"). The Objection Notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the item
of the Adjustment Notice to which each objection relates and the basis for
each such objection. If the Seller delivers an Objection Notice within the
Objection Period, the Seller and the Purchaser shall attempt in good faith to
resolve any dispute concerning the items subject to such Objection Notice. If
the Seller and the Purchaser do not resolve any dispute arising in connection
with the Proposed Balance Sheet and its constituent parts within 30 days after
the date of delivery of the Objection Notice, which 30-day period may be
extended by written agreement of the Purchaser and the Seller (such period, as
it may be extended, the "Initial Resolution Period"), such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.4(f). The
Proposed Balance Sheet and the resulting Proposed Net Working Capital,
Proposed Net Plant Value, Proposed Cash Amount and Proposed Indebtedness
Amount shall be deemed to be accepted by the Seller, and shall become final
and binding on the parties hereto on the earlier of (x) the expiration of the
Objection Period without delivery to the Purchaser of an Objection Notice or
(y) the date on which all objections provided for in a timely-delivered
Objection Notice have been resolved by the parties or as provided for in
Section 2.4(f).

  

  

(f) Dispute Resolution Mechanism. If the Purchaser and the Seller have not
been able to resolve the matters set forth in the Objection Notice (the
"Dispute") within the Initial Resolution Period, either party may submit such
disputed matters to Crowe Horwath LLP (the "Reviewing Party"). Both parties
shall submit to the Reviewing Party all materials and information to be
considered by the Reviewing Party as promptly as practicable and in any event
within 30 days following the initial submission of the Dispute to the
Reviewing Party. The fees and expenses of the Reviewing Party incurred in the
resolution of the disputed matters set forth in the Objection Notice shall be
borne by the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, in
proportion to the relative amounts of the aggregate disputed amount as to
which such party prevailed, as determined by the Reviewing Party. The
Reviewing Party shall make a determination regarding the Dispute (and written
notice thereof shall be given to the Seller and the Purchaser) as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within 30 days following the date on which the
last item of information regarding the Dispute has been delivered to the
Reviewing Party. The Reviewing Party will decide only the matters specifically
raised in the Dispute based solely on the submissions made to the Reviewing
Party which may include factual testimony and legal memoranda. The Reviewing
Party will provide a written explanation in reasonable detail of the
resolution of each matter raised in the Dispute, including the basis therefor;
provided, however, that the Reviewing Party shall only decide the specific
items under dispute by the parties. The determination of the Reviewing Party
shall be final and binding on the Purchaser and the Seller, and the decision
rendered pursuant to this Section 2.4(f) may be filed as a judgment in any
court of competent jurisdiction. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this
Section 2.4(f) shall preclude either party from pursuing any other remedy it
may have under other provisions of this Agreement with respect to matters
other than the matters governed by this provision.

is greater than the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Purchase Price shall be
increased by an amount equal to such surplus.

surplus.

  

  

The net amount of the adjustments to the Purchase Price under this Section
2.4(g) shall be the "Purchase Price Adjustment Deficit" if the net amount of
the adjustments would, in the aggregate, reduce the Purchase Price hereunder,
or the "Purchase Price Adjustment Surplus" if the net amount of the
adjustments would, in the aggregate, increase the Purchase Price hereunder.

(ii) Tax Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. The Purchaser shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause to be filed, all other
Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or

permit the Seller to review and comment upon such Tax Returns at least 15 days
prior to the filing due date,, the Purchaser shall take into account in good
faith any comments provided by the Seller and the Purchaser shall not file
such Tax Returns without the consent of the Seller, which consent shall not be

following any demand by the Seller for such payment, but no earlier than 2
Business Days prior to the applicable due date (taking into account valid
extensions of time within which to file), except to the extent that such Taxes
were taken into account as a current liability that actually reduced Final Net
Working Capital.

  

  

(iii) Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. The
Purchaser shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, consistent with past
practice to the extent consistent with existing law, and file, or cause to be

be obligated to pay to the Purchaser, within 5 days following any demand by
the Purchaser, but no earlier than 2 Business Days prior to the applicable due
date (taking into account valid extensions of time within which to file), an
amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the Pre-Closing
Period portion of each such Straddle Period (as determined pursuant to Section
6.9(c)), except to the extent that such portion of such Taxes was taken into
account as a current liability that actually reduced Final Net Working
Capital. The Purchaser shall permit the Seller to review and comment upon such
Tax Returns at least 15 days prior to the filing due date, the Purchaser shall
take into account in good faith any comments provided by the Seller and the
Purchaser shall not file such Tax Returns without the consent of the Seller,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed it being
understood that failure to raise objection to such Tax Returns within 10 days
of receipt of the applicable Tax Return shall be deemed consent.

  

  

(b) Cooperation in Filing Tax Returns. The Purchaser, the Seller and Seller
Parent shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, fully cooperate
with and provide each other with all reasonably requested information in
connection with preparing, reviewing and filing of any Tax Return, amended Tax
Return or claim for refund, determining Liabilities for Taxes or a right to
refund of Taxes, or in conducting any audit or other Action with respect to
Taxes. Such cooperation and information shall include providing copies of all
relevant portions of relevant Tax Returns, together with relevant accompanying
schedules and relevant work papers, relevant documents relating to rulings and
other determinations by Governmental Entities relating to Taxes, and relevant
records concerning the ownership and Tax basis of property, which any such
party may possess. Each party will retain all Tax Returns, schedules, work
papers, and all material records and other documents relating to Tax matters
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Tax period first ending after the
Closing Date and for all prior Tax periods until the later of either (i) the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notice
is provided with respect thereto, any extensions thereof) for the Tax periods
to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate or (ii) eight years
following the due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. Thereafter,
the party holding such Tax Returns or other documents may dispose of them
provided that such party shall give to the other party 30 days written notice
of such disposal and providing the other party with the opportunity to copy
(at such other party's cost) such Tax Returns or other documents. Each party
shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually-convenient basis
at its cost to provide explanation of any documents or information so
provided.

  

  

(c) Allocation of Certain Taxes and Tax Refunds.

  

  

(i) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is permitted but not required
under applicable state, local or foreign income Tax Laws to treat the Closing
Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the parties shall treat that
day as the last day of a taxable period.

  

  

(ii) In the case of Taxes arising in a Straddle Period, except as provided in
Section 6.9(c)(iii), the allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-Closing
Period and the Post-Closing Period shall be made on the basis of an interim
closing of the books as of the end of the Closing Date.

  

  

(iii) In the case of any real property, personal property or similar ad
valorem Taxes that are payable for a Straddle Period, the portion of such
Taxes which relates to the Pre-Closing Period portion of such Straddle Period
shall be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Pre-Closing Period portion of the Straddle Period and the denominator of which
is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; provided, however, any
such Taxes attributable to any property that was owned by the Company at some
point in the Pre-Closing Period, but is not owned as of the Closing Date,
shall be allocated entirely to the Pre-Closing Period.

  

  

(iv) The Seller shall be entitled to all Tax refunds and overpayments taken as
a credit that relate to Pre-Closing Periods of Company and its Subsidiaries,
and if any such refunds or overpayments are received by the Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries), the Purchaser promptly shall pay or cause to be paid to the
Seller the amount so received, except to the extent that such refunds or
overpayments were taken into account as a current asset that actually
increased Final Working Capital.

  

  

(d) Payment of Transfer Taxes and Fees. The Seller and Purchaser shall each
pay one-half of any Transfer Taxes arising out of or in connection with the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (other than Section 6.20

cooperation in connection with the preparation and filing of such
documentation and Tax Returns as may be reasonably requested by the Seller.

and all Tax allocation agreements, Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements or arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, and the Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Company

the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the day before the Closing Date, and
from and after the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall have
no obligation to make any payments in respect thereof to any Person for any
period.

the Purchaser in, and shall provide the necessary information to the
Purchaser, in connection with the preparation of any form or document required
to effect a valid and timely Section 338(h)(10) Election, including IRS Form

attachments thereto (collectively, "Section 338 Forms"). The Seller, Seller
Parent and the Purchaser shall cooperate fully, and in good faith, with each
other in making the Section 338(h)(10) Election. Each of the Purchaser, the

2.4 but in no event later than 30 days prior to the latest date for the filing
of each applicable Section 338 Form, the Purchaser shall prepare and submit to
the Seller for the Seller's review, comment and approval (such approval not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed and it being understood that failure to
raise objection to within 10 Business Days of receipt of such submission shall
be deemed consent), the Purchaser's proposed allocation of the aggregate
deemed sales price at which the Company and its Subsidiaries are deemed to
have sold their assets for Tax purposes as a result of the Section 338(h)10
Election among the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries as applicable

Seller are unable to reach agreement on the Election Allocations within 20
Business Days of delivery thereof to the Seller, then the Reviewing Party
shall resolve any issue in dispute under this Section 6.9(f) as promptly as
possible and the determination of the Reviewing Party shall be final. The

render unenforceable such covenant or provision in any other jurisdiction.

  

  

6.16 Financing.

  

  

(a) The Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to cause, or cause to be done, all things, in each
case reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to obtain and consummate the
Financing as described in the Highly Confident Letter and, if applicable, the
Equity Financing Letter, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i)
negotiate in good faith and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Loan Financing as soon as reasonably practicable and (A) on the terms and
subject to the conditions reflected in the Highly Confident Letter, or (B) on
such other terms that are acceptable in good faith to the Purchaser; (ii) if
required to obtain sufficient funds to complete the transactions contemplated
hereby, to negotiate in good faith and enter into one or more equity
commitment agreements with respect to the Equity Financing on terms acceptable
in good faith to the Purchaser; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
in the definitive agreements relating to the Loan Financing and, if applicable
the Equity Financing (the "Financing Definitive Agreements") and comply with
the obligations thereunder applicable to the Purchaser and within its control;
(iv) obtain such Third-Party consents as may be reasonably required to be
obtained by the Purchaser in connection with the Financing, subject to the
Seller's compliance with Section 6.16(b) where applicable; and (v) upon the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the Financing Definitive
Agreements, consummate the Financing on or prior to the Closing; provided,
however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, (1)
the Purchaser shall have the right to substitute other debt or equity
financing for all or any portion of the Financing from the same or alternative
financing sources on terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to the
Purchaser in good faith; and (2) the Purchaser shall not be required to, and
the Purchaser shall not be required to cause any other Person to, commence,
participate in, pursue or defend any Action against or involving any of the
Purchaser's lenders or investors or other Persons that have or may have agreed
to provide any portion of, or otherwise with respect to, the Financing. The
Purchaser shall provide the Seller with information on a current basis with
respect to (i) the status of its negotiations with respect to definitive
agreements relating to the Financing, (ii) satisfaction of all conditions in
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing and (iii) such other
matters as the Seller may reasonably request relating to the status of the
Financing. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with an executed copy of
each definitive credit agreement or equity commitment agreement relating to
the Financing promptly following execution thereof in the forms as will be
publicly disclosed, together with any other documents or attachments thereto
to the extent they contain any material terms or conditions to the Financing
not otherwise reflected in the definitive agreement.

  

  

(b) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Closing

Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate reasonably with the Purchaser in
connection with the Purchaser's financing of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including by (i) providing customary information reasonably requested
by the Purchaser relating to such financing; and (ii) making commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain consents from Third Parties as reasonably
necessary and taking such other actions as may reasonably be requested to
facilitate the granting of a security interest to the Purchaser's lenders in
the collateral as contemplated by the Loan Financing on the Closing Date;
provided that (i) nothing herein shall require such cooperation from the
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to the extent that it would unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing operations of the Seller and its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) neither the Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to
expend any funds (other than incidental amounts) or make any payment to any
Third Party in connection with its compliance with this Section 6.16(b).

  

  

(c) Purchaser shall, promptly upon request of the Seller, reimburse the Seller
(and its Affiliates and Representatives, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Seller,
and its Affiliates and Representatives in connection with such cooperation.
The Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller and its Affiliates
and Representatives for and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing except to the extent
such Losses arise from any breach or noncompliance by the Seller, the Company
or its Subsidiaries of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement, or the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller or of the Company or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.

  

  

(d) Any information provided to the Purchaser or its Representatives in
accordance with this Section 6.16 or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement
shall be held by the Purchaser and its Representatives in accordance with,
shall be deemed provided under, and shall be subject to the terms of, the
Confidentiality Agreement.

  

  

6.17 Support Obligations. With respect to each guaranty, letter of credit,
performance or surety bond or similar credit support arrangement issued by or
for the account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shown on Section
6.17 of the Seller's Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "Support
Obligations"), the Purchaser shall obtain, prior to or as of the Closing,
substitute credit support arrangements in replacement for the Support
Obligations, and shall procure that each of the Seller and its Affiliates,
and, where applicable, their sureties or letter of credit issuers, be fully
released from their respective obligations under the Support Obligations as of
the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Seller.
The Seller will cooperate reasonably with the Purchaser with respect to the
foregoing.

  

  

6.18 WARN Notice. As promptly as practicable following the date hereof, the
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) cause the Contractors to
issue to its employees the notice required under the WARN Act or any other
applicable Law in connection with the termination of the Contract Mining
Agreements pursuant to Section 6.5(d).

  

  

6.19 Other Funds. From and after the Closing, (i) if the Seller or its
Affiliates receives or collects any cash, checks or other property which are
the property of the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Seller
shall remit any such amounts to the Purchaser as promptly as practicable but
no later than ten Business Days after the Seller receives such sum, and (ii)
if the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries receives or collects any
cash, checks or other property which are the property of the Seller, the
Purchaser shall remit any such amounts to the Seller as promptly as
practicable but no later than ten Business Days after the Purchaser receives
such sum.

  

  

6.20 Like-Kind Exchange. The Seller acknowledges that the Purchaser is
contemplating acquiring a portion of the assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries through a like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the
Code, and agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in effecting such
transaction, including by causing the Company and its Subsidiaries to sell
certain of their assets to be identified by the Purchaser to an Affiliate of
the Purchaser, or to a Qualified Intermediary as defined by Reg. Section
1.1031(k)(1)(g)(4) or an Exchange Accommodation Titleholder as defined in Rev.
Proc. 2000-37, immediately prior to the Closing on terms reasonably acceptable
to the Seller. The Purchaser shall indemnify the Seller for any additional
Taxes incurred by the Seller solely as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Section 6.20, and shall reimburse the Seller for any
reasonable out-of-pocket costs (other than attorney's fees) incurred by the
Seller or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with their
cooperation hereunder.

  

  

6.21 Use of Name. From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser shall
promptly cease all use of the trademarks, trade names, corporate names, domain
names and logos containing the name "Vectren", and shall, on or promptly after
the Closing Date, take all steps necessary to change the name of the Company,
including by making filings with the applicable Secretary(ies) of State and
other applicable Governmental Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Purchaser may continue to use the name "Vectren" after the Closing Date solely
to the extent necessary to prepare any Tax or other filings to be made with
any Governmental Entity, provided that any such use is on a non-public basis.

and Article X will survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.1.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

INDEMNIFICATION

  

  

9.1 Survival.

  

  

(a) All representations and warranties of the parties hereto contained in this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement and any certificate or other document
provided hereunder will survive the Closing and the consummation and
performance of the transactions contemplated hereby. None of the covenants and
other obligations of the parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing Date except for those that by their terms contemplate performance
after the Closing Date, and each such surviving covenant and agreement shall
survive the Closing for the period contemplated by its terms. If the Closing
occurs, the Seller shall have liability with respect to a breach of any
representation or warranty only if the Purchaser delivers a Notice of Claim
with respect to such breach on or before the date that is twelve (12) months
following the Closing Date; provided, however, that (a) the Seller shall have
liability (i) with respect to the representations and warranties contained in
Article III (except Sections 3.3 and 3.6) and Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.24 (such
representations and warranties being referred to as the "Seller's Fundamental
Representations") if the Purchaser delivers a Notice of Claim at any time, and
(ii) with respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections
4.5 and 4.15 if the Purchaser delivers a Notice of Claim on or before the date
that is 60 days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, as extended, and (b) the Purchaser shall have liability with
respect to the representations and warranties contained in Sections 5.1, 5.2
and 5.5 (such representations and warranties being referred to as the
"Purchaser's Fundamental Representations") if the Seller delivers a Notice of
Claim at any time.

  

  

(b) In the event a Notice of Claim for indemnification under Section 9.2 or
9.3 is given within the applicable survival period set forth in Section
9.1(a), the representation or warranty, covenant or agreement that is the
subject of such indemnification claim (whether or not formal legal Action
shall have been commenced based upon such claim) shall survive with respect to
such claim until such claim is finally resolved. The Indemnitor shall
indemnify the Indemnitee for all Losses (subject to the limitations set forth
herein, if applicable) that the Indemnitee may incur in respect of such claim,
regardless of when incurred.

  

  

9.2 Indemnification by the Seller. If the Closing occurs and subject to the

employees, agents, successors and assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnitees")
against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all losses, damages,
claims, charges, Liabilities, Actions, interest, penalties, Taxes, costs and
expenses, including legal, consultant, accounting and other professional fees,
and fees and costs actually incurred (collectively, "Losses") resulting from,

or warranty made by the Seller in this Agreement, any of the Ancillary
Agreements or any certificate or other document furnished or to be furnished
to the Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) any breach by the Seller of any covenant or agreement contained
in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; (c) except to the extent

as a current liability that actually reduced Final Net Working Capital, (i)
any Tax imposed on or relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries with respect
to any Pre-Closing Period; (ii) any Liabilities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries for the Taxes of another Person (such as the Seller or Seller
Parent) as a transferee or successor, by Contract (other than a commercial
Contract the principal purpose of which is not Tax related) or by operation of
law, where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries became a transferee or
successor, entered into such Contract or the relationship or connection giving
rise to such Liabilities arose prior to the Closing; (d) Cypress Creek Mine,
LLC, an Indiana limited liability company, or any of its assets, properties,
rights, liabilities and obligations, or any other assets, properties, rights,
liabilities and obligations related to the former Cypress Creek surface mine;
(e) any Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses to the extent not satisfied prior

with any other entity associated with the Mining Operations, including (i)
under any Plan, (ii) for taxation or Tax Reporting, and (iii) under the Fair
Labor Standards Act or any similar state statute; (i) any Liens of the type
set forth in clause (e) of the definition of Permitted Liens which have not

(k) to the extent set forth in Section 6.5(e)(ii), the Lafayette Pre-Closing
Payments; and (l) any Benefit Plans.

  

  

9.3 Indemnification by the Purchaser. If the Closing occurs and subject to the
limitations set forth herein, the Purchaser shall indemnify and defend the
Seller and its Affiliates, and their respective stockholders, members,
managers, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns (the
"Seller Indemnitees") against, and shall hold them harmless from, any and all
Losses resulting from, arising out of, or incurred by any Seller Indemnitee in
connection with, or otherwise with respect to: (a) any inaccuracy or breach of
any representation or warranty made by the Purchaser in this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements or any certificate or other document furnished or
to be furnished to the Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (b) any breach by the Purchaser of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements; (c)

is obligated to indemnify the Purchaser Indemnitees pursuant to Section 9.2,
and (ii) any claims the Purchaser or the Company and its Subsidiaries may have
against the Seller or its Affiliates) (d) any Taxes of the Company or its
Subsidiaries attributable to a Post-Closing Period and indemnification for

9.4 Indemnification Procedure for Third Party Claims.

  

  

(a) In the event that an Indemnitee becomes aware of the possibility of any
claim or the commencement of any Action by a third party in respect of which
indemnity may be sought under the provisions of Section 6.3(a), Section
6.16(c), Section 6.20 or this Article IX (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Indemnitee shall notify the Indemnitor in writing of such Third Party Claim
(such notice, a "Notice of Claim"); provided that the failure or delay in
notifying the Indemnitor of such Third Party Claim will not relieve the
Indemnitor of any Liability it may have to the Indemnitee except to the extent
that such failure or delay causes actual harm to the Indemnitor with respect
to such Third Party Claim. Any Notice of Claim shall describe the Third Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all written material
written evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the
Indemnified Party.

  

  

(b) The Indemnitor will have 30 days from the date on which the Indemnitor
received the Notice of Claim (the "Indemnitor Defense Review Period") to
notify the Indemnitee that the Indemnitor desires to assume the defense or
prosecution of such Third Party Claim and any litigation resulting therefrom
with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitee and at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnitor (a "Third Party Defense"). At any time prior to the
Indemnitor's assumption of the Third Party Defense in accordance herewith, the
Indemnitee may file any motion, answer or other pleading or take any other
action that the Indemnitee in good faith believes to be necessary to protect
its interests. If the Indemnitor assumes the Third Party Defense in accordance
herewith: (i) the Indemnitee may, at its own expense, retain separate co-
counsel and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, but the
Indemnitor shall control the investigation, defense and settlement thereof;
(ii) the Indemnitor will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnitee which consent shall not be unreasonably
delayed, conditioned or withheld; (iii) the Indemnitor shall conduct the Third
Party Defense actively and diligently and keep the Indemnitee reasonably
informed about developments in connection with the Third Party Defense; (iv)
the Indemnitor will not take any action, or omit to take any action, without
the consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), that would cause any Contracts,
correspondence or other documents of the Indemnitee or its Affiliates to be
disclosed to a third party; and (v) the Indemnitee will provide reasonable
cooperation in the Third Party Defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
counsel for the Indemnitee reasonably determines that there is a conflict
between the positions of the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee in conducting the
defense of such Action or that there are legal defenses available to such
Indemnitee different from or in addition to those available to the Indemnitor,
then counsel for the Indemnitee shall be entitled, if the Indemnitee so
elects, to conduct the defense to the extent reasonably determined by such
counsel to protect the interests of the Indemnitee, at the expense of the
Indemnitor but only with respect to issues with respect to which such conflict
exists.

  

  

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the Third Party Defense prior to the end
of the Indemnitor Defense Review Period, the Indemnitee shall have the right
to assume the Third Party Defense with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitor, at the expense of the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the
Indemnitor shall have the right, at its expense, to participate in such Third
Party Defense but the Indemnitee shall control the investigation, defense and
settlement thereof. The Indemnitee shall conduct the Third Party Defense
actively and diligently, and the Indemnitor will provide reasonable
cooperation in the Third Party Defense. The Indemnitee shall have the right to
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to the Third Party Claim in any manner and on such terms as it may deem
appropriate without the consent of the Indemnitor; provided, however, that the
amount of any settlement made or entry of any judgment consented to by the
Indemnitee without the consent of the Indemnitor (not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) shall not be determinative of the validity of the claim.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, without the written
consent of the Purchaser, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, the Seller shall not be entitled to assume any Third Party
Defense: (i) to the extent that any such Third Party Claim seeks, in addition
to or in lieu of monetary damages, any injunctive or other equitable relief
against the Purchaser, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Affiliates; (ii) if such Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, Action, indictment, allegation or
investigation against the Purchaser, the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Affiliates; or (iii) if the Seller has failed or is
failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such Third Party Claim.

  

  

(e) The Seller and the Purchaser shall cooperate with the each other in all
reasonable aspects in connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim,
including (i) making available (subject to the provisions of Section 6.11)
records relating to such Third Party Claim and furnishing, without expense
(other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses), to the defending
party, management employees of the non-defending party as may reasonably be
necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third Party Claim, and
(ii) making available the benefits of the Policies in effect prior to or after
the Closing to the extent available to satisfy any such Third Party Claim.

  

  

9.5 Indemnification Procedures for Non-Third Party Claims. In the event that
an Indemnitee becomes aware of the possibility of a claim that does not
involve a Third Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under
the provisions of Section 6.3(a), Section 6.16(c), Section 6.20 or this
Article IX, the Indemnitee shall send a Notice of Claim to the Indemnitor. The
Indemnitor will have 30 days from receipt of such notice of claim to dispute
the claim and will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnitee in
determining the validity of the claim for indemnity. If the Indemnitor does
not give notice to the Indemnitee that it disputes such claim within 30 days
after its receipt of the notice of claim, the claim specified in such notice
of claim will be presumed to be a Loss subject to indemnification hereunder,
provided that the Indemnitor shall not be precluded from subsequently
challenging its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee for such Loss except to
the extent that such delay has prejudiced the Indemnified Party's defense
against such claim.

  

  

9.6 Other Matters Relating to Indemnification.

  

  

(a) Limitations on Liability for Seller. Except for claims with respect to the
Seller's Fundamental Representations, the Seller shall not be required to
indemnify any Purchaser Indemnittee for any Loss, or any series of related
Losses, (i) pursuant to Section 9.2(a) that do not exceed $50,000 (the "De
Minimis Claim Amount"); provided, however, that, to the extent any such Loss,
or series of related Losses, exceeds the De Minimis Claim Amount with respect
to any Loss, or series of related Losses, the full amount of such Loss shall
be applied to the Deductible, and (ii) except to the extent that the aggregate
amount of such Losses exceeds $5,000,000 (the "Deductible"), and then only to
the extent that the aggregate of such Losses exceeds the Deductible.

  

  

(b) Cap on Liability for Seller. (i) The Seller's aggregate liability for all
claims made pursuant to Section 9.2(a) other than claims with respect to the
Seller's Fundamental Representations shall not exceed $30,000,000, and (ii)
the Seller's aggregate liability for all claims made with respect to the
Seller's Fundamental Representations or pursuant to Sections 9.2(b) through
(k) shall not exceed the Base Purchase Price.

  

  

(c) Qualifications. For purposes of this Article IX, all qualifications as to
materiality or Material Adverse Effect contained in any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein will be disregarded for
purposes of determining the amount of any Loss, but not for purposes of
determining whether a Loss has occurred.

  

  

(d) Exclusive Remedy. The indemnification rights of the parties under this
Article IX are the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing for claims
seeking monetary damages available to the Purchaser Indemnitees and the Seller
Indemnitees, as applicable, for breaches of any of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, the parties shall treat any indemnification payment made
hereunder as an adjustment to the consideration payable under this Agreement.

  

  

(f) Interest on Losses. Any and all Losses hereunder shall bear interest from
the date actual expenditure is made by the Indemnified Party until paid by the
Indemnitor at the "prime rate" as published in The Wall Street Journal,
Eastern Edition on the date such expenditure was made by the Indemnitee.

  

  

(g) Insurance. Payments by an Indemnitor in respect of any Loss shall be
reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds and any indemnity,
contribution or other similar payment received by the Indemnitee in respect of
any such claim. The Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnitor
and use its commercially reasonable efforts to recover or assist the
Indemnitor to recover under any applicable insurance policies or applicable
indemnity, contribution or other similar agreements for any Losses; provided
that the foregoing shall not be deemed or construed to require the Indemnitee
to resolve any claims for recovery prior to submitting a claim for
indemnification to the Indemnitor.

  

  

(h) Tax Benefits. Payments by an Indemnitor in respect of any Loss shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the cash value Tax benefit (if any) (i) actually
recognized by the Indemnitee incurring the Loss as a current deduction in the
taxable year such Loss was incurred, or (ii) reasonably expected to be
realized in the next taxable year following the year such Loss was incurred.

  

  

(i) No Duplication; Subsequent Payments. No Indemnitee shall be entitled to
recover any Loss to the extent (i) indemnification of such amount would
constitute a duplicative payment for the same Loss, whether because it
constitutes a breach of more than one representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement or being addressed by more than one clause under Section 9.2 or
Section 9.3 or otherwise or (ii) such amount has had the effect of reducing
the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 2.3 or 2.4. If any Indemnitee receives
payment or reimbursement from any source for any amount for which such
Indemnitee has previously received payment from an Indemnitor pursuant to
either Section 9.2 or 9.3, such Indemnitee shall promptly pay the full amount
of such payment or reimbursement to such Indemnitor.

  

  

(j) Mitigation. In the event of any breach giving rise to an indemnification
obligation under this Article IX, each Indemnitee shall take, or cause its
Affiliates to take, reasonable steps to mitigate the Losses arising from such
breach.

Annex I

  

  

Coal Inventory Methodology

  

  

Stockpile Surveying Methodology

  

  

The methods currently being utilized at the Seller's Mining Operations to
measure and calculate stockpile volumes, as described below, shall be used to
determine stockpile volumes. Representatives of the Purchaser's engineering
staff must be present before and during the surveying of the stockpiles at the
Mining Operations, to make certain that both parties are in agreement that the
agreed procedures were followed. The parties shall cooperate and work together
in good faith to negate any problems that may arise during the surveying of
the stockpiles.

  

  

Oaktown

  

  

Vectren Fuels, Inc.'s Oaktown operation consists of a coal preparation and
handling system that keeps the individual mine stockpiles, both on the clean
and raw side, separate for each mine - Oaktown 1 and Oaktown 2. There are two
separate clean stockpiles and two separate raw stockpiles - 4 piles total.
There is also one small clean stockpile of purchased coal, mixed, stacked near
the rail.

  

  

The separated stockpiles are graded and shaped with dozers upon leaving the
stacking tubes. Each dozer is equipped with a GPS tracking device that
provides real-time feedback as the dozer passes over the stockpile to aid in
measuring stockpile volumes. Each of the stockpiles at Oaktown 1 and Oaktown 2
must be properly graded and shaped prior to surveying, to allow for accurate
measurement of the piles by dozer passes.

  

  

In addition to the data gathered by the dozer/GPS units, measurements of the
base of each stockpile and areas of each stockpile outside the influence of
reclaim feeders are directly measured by mobile/hand-held surveying units. The
raw data from the dozer/GPS units and the mobile/hand-held surveying units are
combined for each stockpile, input into CAD-based software, and used to
generate stockpile volumes.

  

  

Prosperity

  

  

There is only one slope at Vectren Fuels Inc.'s Prosperity mine, so there are
only two stockpiles - one raw stockpile and one clean stockpile at this mine.

  

  

Stockpiles at the Prosperity mine are measured using direct surveying methods,
consisting of a total station and/or mobile/hand-held laser device. Areas of
the stockpiles that can be safely and directly traversed, the base of each
stockpile and those outside the influence of reclaim feeders, are measured
directly with GPS units. Areas of the stockpiles outside these safe areas are
measured with a hand-held laser.

  

  

General

  

  

Once the pile volumes are established, assumptions of both recovery and
density must be made to establish tonnage in both the raw and clean
stockpiles.

  

  

Densities and Recoveries

  

  

Clean

  

  

The clean coal stockpiles at the Oaktown and Prosperity mine locations will be
assumed to have a clean coal loose density of 55 lb/ft3. Recovery for clean
coal stockpiles will be assumed to be 100% (i.e., a value of 1.0 will be used
in the calculation of stockpile tonnage).

  

  

Raw

  

  

The raw coal stockpiles at the Oaktown and Prosperity mine locations will be
assumed to have a raw coal loose density of 80.0 lb/ft3.

  

  

Recovery for raw coal stockpiles will be determined for each of the Oaktown 1,
Oaktown 2 and Prosperity mines, based on plant recovery data from such mine
during the 120 day period ending on the day prior to the date on which the
coal inventory is determined pursuant to the Agreement. The average recovery
for the raw coal stockpiles for each mine (i.e., Oaktown 1, Oaktown 2 and
Prosperity), over the 120-day period, will be the recovery used in the
calculation of tonnage for that mine.

  

  

Calculation of Stockpile Tonnages

  

  

Clean:

  

  

Tonnages for each clean coal stockpile will be calculated based on the
surveyed volume for that stockpile, and applying a loose coal density of 55
lb/ft3 and a 100% recovery.

  

  

For example, assume a volume of one thousand loose cubic yards (1,000 c.y.).
Utilizing the density and recovery stated above, the clean tons would be:

  

  

(1,000 c.y.)x(27 ft3/1c.y)x(55 lb/ft3)x(1 ton/2000 lb)x(1.0) = 742.5 tons of
clean coal

  

  

Note: There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. There are 2,000 pounds in a
ton.

  

  

Raw:

  

  

Tonnages for each raw coal stockpile will be calculated based on the surveyed
volume for that stockpile, and applying a loose coal density of 80.0 lb/ft3
and the average recovery for the applicable mine (i.e., Oaktown 1, Oaktown 2
and Prosperity) over the 120 day period as described above. Thus, each raw
coal stockpile may have a different recovery based on each mine's individual
properties

  

  

For example, assume a volume of one thousand loose cubic yards (1,000 c.y.).
Utilizing the density stated above and assuming a recovery of 60%, the clean
tons would be:

  

  

(1,000 c.y.)x(27 ft3/1c.y)x(80.0 lb/ft3)x(1 ton/2000 lb)x(0.6) = 648 tons of
clean coal

  

  

Note: There are 27 cubic feet in a cubic yard. There are 2,000 pounds in a
ton.

Exhibit A

  

  

Seller Guaranty

  

  

This GUARANTY, dated as of the ____ day of _________, 2014, is entered into by
Vectren Enterprises, Inc. an Indiana corporation ("Enterprises"), to and for
the benefit of Sunrise Coal, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company (the
"Purchaser").

  

  

WITNESSETH:

  

  

WHEREAS, VECTREN UTILITY SERVICES, INC., an Indiana corporation ("VUSI"), is a
wholly owned subsidiary of Enterprises;

  

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of June
30, 2014 (the "Purchase Agreement"), by and among the Purchaser, VUSI and
VUSI's wholly owned subsidiary, VECTREN FUELS, INC., an Indiana corporation
("Fuels"), VUSI has agreed to sell to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser has
agreed to purchase from VUSI, all of the capital stock of Fuels, subject to
and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement; and

  

  

WHEREAS, as a condition precedent to the Purchaser consummating that
transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and performing its
obligations thereunder, and as an inducement to the Purchaser entering into
the Purchase Agreement, Enterprises has agreed to execute and deliver this
Guaranty for the benefit of the Purchaser;

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the following
covenants and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Enterprises covenants with the
Purchaser as follows:

  

  

1. Guaranty. For value received and in consideration of the direct and indirect benefits to be derived by Enterprises in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, with effect from the date of this Guaranty, Enterprises hereby guarantees VUSI's full and prompt payment as and when due of all amounts owed by VUSI under Article IX of the Purchase Agreement, subject in all respects to all of the conditions, limitations, and qualifications set forth in the Purchase Agreement (the "Obligations). This is a continuing Guaranty of payment and not merely of collection. Subject to the provisions of Section 4, this Guaranty shall terminate upon the earlier of the termination of the Obligations or the date which is three (3) years from the date of this Guaranty; provided, however, that this Guaranty and Enterprise's liability hereunder shall survive any such termination with respect to any claims made by the Purchaser under the Purchase Agreement if such claims are made prior to such termination.

  

  

2. Waiver. Enterprises hereby expressly waives notice from the Purchaser of its acceptance of and reliance upon this Guaranty. Enterprises consents to any extensions of time for the payment of the Obligations and to any changes in the terms of the Purchase Agreement, and waives any notices thereof. Enterprises also waives promptness, diligence, presentment to or demand of payment from anyone liable upon the Obligations, and presentment, notice of dishonor, protest and all other notices whatsoever. No waiver, amendment, release or modification of this Guaranty shall be established by conduct, custom or course of dealing, but solely by an instrument in writing duly executed by Enterprises and the Purchaser. The Purchaser's failure or delay in exercising any right, remedy or power hereunder shall not operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Purchaser of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude the Purchaser from any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power. Each and every right, remedy and power granted to the Purchaser hereunder or allowed to it by law or other agreement shall be cumulative with and not exclusive of any other.

  

  

3. Waiver of Defenses. The liability of Enterprises under this Guaranty, and Enterprises' obligations under this Guaranty shall not be impaired or released as a result of (a) any change of the time, manner or terms of payment of any of the Obligations; (b) any renewal or increase of any of the Obligations; (c) any release or partial release of any other guarantor or other obligor in respect of any of the Obligations; (d) any modification, amendment, waiver or renewal of, or consent to departure from, any agreement or instrument relating to any of the Obligations; (e) the Purchaser's exercise or failure to exercise any rights against VUSI, Enterprises or others or any other action or inaction by the Purchaser in respect of any of the Obligations; (f) with respect to any of the foregoing, the lack of notice to or consent by Enterprises; or (g) any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a defense available to, or discharge of, a surety or a guarantor excepting payment. Nothing herein is intended to deny Enterprises, and Enterprises shall have and may assert any and all of the defenses, set-offs, counterclaims and other rights which VUSI is or may be entitled to assert that arise from or out of the Purchase Agreement, except for defenses arising out of the bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution or liquidation of VUSI. The obligations of Enterprises hereunder are several from VUSI or any other person, and are primary obligations concerning which Enterprises is the principal obligor. There are no conditions precedent to the enforcement of this Guaranty, except as expressly contained herein.

  

  

4. Reinstatement Provision. If the Purchaser receives any payment or payments on account of the Obligations, which payment or payments of any part thereof are subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside and/or required to be repaid to a trustee, receiver, or any other party under any bankruptcy act or code, state or federal law, common law or equitable doctrine, then to the extent of any sum not finally retained by the Purchaser, Enterprises' obligations to the Purchaser hereunder shall be reinstated and this Guaranty, shall remain in full force and effect (or be reinstated) until payment of the Obligations shall have been made to the Purchaser, which payment shall be due on demand.

  

  

5. Assignment. This Guaranty shall be binding upon Enterprises and upon its successors and assigns and shall be for the benefit of the Purchaser and its successors and assigns. Enterprises may not assign this Guaranty or the obligations hereunder without the express written consent of the Purchaser and such assignment will not be unreasonably withheld. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 5 shall be void and without effect.

  


 

  

6. Applicable Law. This Guaranty shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana, without giving effect to laws of such state that would require the application of the laws of any other state.

  

  

7. Severability. In case any clause, provision or section of this Guaranty, or any application thereof, is for any reason held to be illegal, invalid, or inoperable, Enterprises and the Purchaser shall negotiate an equitable adjustment to such affected provisions of this guaranty with a view towards effecting the purpose and intent of the Guaranty, and subject to such adjustment such illegality, invalidity or inoperability shall not affect the remainder thereof or any other clause, provision or section, and each such clause, provision or section shall be deemed to be effective and operative in the manner and to the fullest extent permitted by law.

  

  

8. Only Agreement. This Guaranty is the entire and only agreement between Enterprises and the Purchaser with respect to the guaranty of the Obligations of VUSI by Enterprises.

  

  

9. Representations and Warranties. Enterprises represents and warrants to the Purchaser that: (a) it is a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of the State of Indiana; (b) it has all requisite power and authority to execute and to deliver and to perform all of its obligations under this Guaranty; (c) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty by Enterprises are within its corporate powers and have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate actions; (d) this Guaranty constitutes a legally valid and binding agreement of Enterprises, subject only to insolvency, bankruptcy, moratorium, reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and by general principles of equity; (e) the execution, delivery and performance of this Guaranty will not violate any provision of any requirement of law or contractual obligation of Enterprises (except to the extent that any such violation would not reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on Enterprises' ability to perform this Guaranty); (f) no consent or authorization of, filing with, or other act by or in respect of, any arbitrator or governmental authority and no consent of any other person (including, without limitation, any stockholder or creditor of Enterprises) is required in connection with the execution, delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Guaranty, other than any which have been obtained or made prior to the date hereof and remain in full force and effect; and (g) no litigation, investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or governmental authority is pending or, to the knowledge of Enterprises, threatened by or against Enterprises relating to this Guaranty or that would have a material adverse effect on Enterprises' ability to perform this Guaranty.

  

  

10. Collection Expenses. If the Purchaser is required to pursue any remedy against Enterprises hereunder, Enterprises shall pay to the Purchaser upon demand, all reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and all other reasonable costs, expenses and fees incurred by the Purchaser in successfully enforcing this Guaranty.

INTERIM OPERATING AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS INTERIM OPERATING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of the 28th day
of June, 2014, is made and entered into by and between Black Panther Mining,
LLC, an Indiana limited liability company ("BPM"), and Oaktown Fuels No. 1
Mine, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company ("Owner").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

BPM and Owner are parties to the Contract Mining Agreement dated January 14,
2000 (as amended, the "CMA") whereby BPM operates the Oaktown Mine for Owner.

  

  

Pursuant to the CMA, the permits for or relating to the operation of the
Oaktown Mine, including the permits listed on Exhibit A attached hereto, have
been issued in the name of BPM (collective, the "Permits").

  

  

BPM, Owner, Vectren Fuels, Inc., SFI Coal Sales, LLC, and Vectren Utility
Services, Inc. have entered into an agreement whereby the CMA will be
terminated (the "Termination Agreement") effective as of the date of the
closing (the "Closing Date") of the transaction contemplated by the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of June [30], 2014 between Vectren Utility
Services, Inc. (Owner's remote parent) and Sunrise Coal, LLC .

  

  

Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, BPM, Owner and the other parties
thereto have agreed to cooperate to effect the transfer of the Permits to
Owner or its designees, which transfer may occur subsequent to the Closing
Date.

  

  

As a condition to the Termination Agreement, and in order to effect the
transition from operation of the Oaktown Mine by BPM to operation by Owner or
its designee, BPM has agreed to enter into this Interim Operating Agreement.

  

  

In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set forth herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

AGREEMENT

  

  

INTERIM OPERATIONS. Subject to any required consent or approval by the
governmental authority that issues or administrates a Permit, BPM hereby
grants Owner and its designees the right to operate the Oaktown Mine under and
pursuant to the Permits, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, during the period from and after the Closing Date and continuing
until the date on which such Permits are transferred to Owner or its designee.
Owner and each of its designees shall operate solely as an independent
contractor and not as an agent, employee or servant of BPM. BPM shall have no
right or obligation in any way to direct, supervise or control the mining and
reclamation activities of Owner. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, as between BPM and Owner, all of Owner's operations shall be at the
sole cost and expense of Owner, and any benefit gained from such operations
shall likewise be for the sole account and benefit of Owner. To the extent
that the process of transferring the Permits has not been commenced prior to
the Closing Date, BPM agrees that Owner shall have the right (at its sole cost
and expense) to prepare, submit and obtain approval of any necessary
applications for the transfer or re-issuance of the Permits; provided that BPM
shall have an opportunity to review any such filing in advance. BPM and Owner
or its designee shall reasonably cooperate and coordinate with each other as
necessary for Owner or such designee to submit and obtain approvals for the
transfer or re-issuance of the Permits. None of Owner or its designees shall
receive any compensation from BPM, and BPM shall receive no compensation from
Owner in connection with the operations of the Oaktown Mine or the transfer or
re-issuance of the Permits as contemplated herein.

  

  

NOTICES.

  

  

If BPM or Owner receives a notice of violation, a cessation order or any other
correspondence, order, citation or communication of any kind under any of the
Permits following the Closing Date but before the transfer or re-issuance of a
Permit, BPM shall give Owner, or Owner shall give BPM, as applicable, prompt
written notice thereof. Any notice or other communication given under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be: (i) delivered personally; (ii)
sent by documented overnight delivery service; (iii) sent by facsimile
transmission, provided that a confirmation copy thereof is sent no later than
the Business Day following the day of such transmission by documented
overnight delivery service or first class mail, postage prepaid (certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested); or (iv) sent by first class mail,
postage prepaid (certified or registered mail, return receipt requested). Such
notice shall be deemed to have been duly given: (w) on the date of the
delivery, if delivered personally; (x) on the Business Day after dispatch by
documented overnight delivery service, if sent in such manner; (y) on the date
of facsimile transmission, if so transmitted; or (z) on the fifth Business Day
after sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, if sent in such manner.
Notices or other communications shall be directed to the following addresses:

3. VIOLATIONS, ABATEMENT AND INSPECTION. (a) During the term of this Agreement, the Owner shall be responsible for compliance with all obligations of the terms of the Permits and all laws and regulations applicable to the Permits and the operations performed pursuant thereto (the "Permit Obligations"). If BPM or Owner receives a notice of violation, cessation order or other notice relating to a failure to comply with the Permit Obligations (a "Violation"), Owner will promptly take action to abate or otherwise resolve the Violation. Owner will give BPM notice when the Violation has been abated. (b) If Owner fails to timely abate a Violation, BPM shall notify Owner of its intention to undertake abatement activities. If after such notice, Owner does not undertake remedial action, BPM shall be entitled to undertake remedial actions on its own behalf. (c) During term of this Agreement, BPM, its agents, engineers or other related persons on its behalf, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enter onto the Oaktown Mine premises (the "Property"), for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the operations located on the Property, and the status of Owner's compliance with the Permits, provided that BPM shall not in any event interfere with the operation at the Oaktown Mine or on the Property, and that BPM shall, and shall cause its representatives to, comply with all of Owner's (or its designee's) safety and security policies in effect at such time. BPM shall give Owner reasonable prior notice of its intent to make inspections or enter the Property and shall provide Owner (or its designee) with an opportunity to have Owner's representative accompany the representatives of BPM while they are on the Property. Operator shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate BPM's exercise its rights under this Section 3.

  

  

4. COVENANTS OF OWNER. Owner covenants to BPM that Owner will operate the Oaktown Mine and conduct coal mining and processing operations any other activity conducted under the Permits in substantial compliance with the Permits and any applicable laws, and Owner will not materially deviate from any methods of operation established as a condition of the Permits (as they may be amended) at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to receipt of written approval of such deviation from the relevant governmental authority or the transfer or reissuance of the relevant Permit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Owner or its designees shall be under any obligation, nor shall this Interim Operating Agreement be construed to impose any obligation on Owner or any of its designees, to conduct coal mining or processing operations on the Property.

  

  

5. INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF OWNER.

  

  

Owner will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BPM and its, assigns and
successors in interest, and each of their respective stockholders, members,
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and
representatives (the "BPM Indemnified Persons"), from and against any actions,
suits, proceedings, demands, claims, investigations, penalties, assessments,
judgments, costs, liabilities or expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and court costs, incurred by any BPM Indemnified Person resulting from
any failure by Owner or its designee to comply with applicable law with
respect to the Oaktown Mine, including any surface operations related thereto
after the Closing Date and prior to the date on which the last of the Permits
is transferred or re-issued to Owner or its designees, or to operate the
Oaktown Mine after the Closing Date in accordance with a Permit, including any
citation, notice of violation or penalty assessed as a result of or in
connection with such failure, that occurs after the Closing Date and prior to
the date on which such Permit is transferred or re-issued to Owner or its
designee, in each case except to the extent directly resulting from the
negligence or intentional misconduct of any of the BPM Indemnified Persons
(any of the foregoing, a "BPM Indemnified Loss").

  

  

Promptly after the receipt by any BPM Indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any action, suit, proceeding, demand, claim or
investigation by a third party (an "Asserted Liability") that may result in a
BPM Indemnified Loss, such BPM Indemnified Person will give written notice
thereof (the "Claims Notice") to Owner. The failure to give such Claims Notice
shall not relieve Owner from any obligation hereunder, except to the extent
that such failure causes actual harm to BPM. Owner shall have the right to
assume the control of the defense of such Asserted Liability, at Owner's
expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to such BPM
Indemnified Person; provided, that Owner shall so notify such BPM Indemnified
Person that it will defend such Asserted Liability within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of such Claims Notice.

  

  

6. DURATION. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall automatically terminate without any action of the Parties as of the date on which Owner or its designee obtains the consent or approval of the relevant governmental authority to the transfer, assignment or re-issuance to Owner or its designee of the last of the Permits, and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties thereunder arising during or relating to the period between the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

7. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Any assignment permitted to be made by either Owner or BPM to any person or entity pursuant to this Section 6 shall not relieve the assigning party from any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Owner may assign a security interest in this Agreement to its lenders and BPM hereby consents to such assignment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to restrict or prohibit Owner from designating the rights granted pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement or subcontracting for the performance of any or all of its activities or operations in connection with the Oaktown Mine.

  

  

8. MODIFICATION. No term or provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. No course of dealing between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

9. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Indiana (without reference to its rules as to conflicts of law).

  

  

10. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under applicable Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

11. WAIVER. The failure of any party hereto to insist on the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right, power or remedy upon breach hereof shall not limit such party's right thereafter to enforce any provision or exercise any right.

  

  

12. EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne solely and entirely by the party that has incurred such expenses.

EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, ARBITRATION, INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION TO WHICH SUCH PARTY IS A PARTY INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

15. DUE AUTHORIZATION. BPM and Owner each represent and warrant to the other that (i) it has the power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and carry out this Agreement, and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been, and the individual that executes this Agreement on behalf of BPM or Owner, respectively, has been, duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate or limited liability company action.

  

  

16. PARTIES IN INTEREST. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and except for the rights of the BPM Indemnified Persons as set forth in Section 5, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person or entity any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

INTERIM OPERATING AGREEMENT

  

  

THIS INTERIM OPERATING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of the 28th day
of June, 2014, is made and entered into by and between Black Panther Mining,
LLC, an Indiana limited liability company ("BPM"), and Oaktown Fuels No. 2
Mine, LLC, an Indiana limited liability company ("Owner").

  

  

RECITALS

  

  

BPM and Owner are parties to the Contract Mining Agreement dated January 14,
2000 (as amended, the "CMA") whereby BPM operates the Oaktown Mine for Owner.

  

  

Pursuant to the CMA, the permits for or relating to the operation of the
Oaktown Mine, including the permits listed on Exhibit A attached hereto, have
been issued in the name of BPM (collective, the "Permits").

  

  

BPM, Owner, Vectren Fuels, Inc., SFI Coal Sales, LLC, and Vectren Utility
Services, Inc. have entered into an agreement whereby the CMA will be
terminated (the "Termination Agreement") effective as of the date of the
closing (the "Closing Date") of the transaction contemplated by the Stock
Purchase Agreement dated as of June [30], 2014 between Vectren Utility
Services, Inc. (Owner's remote parent) and Sunrise Coal, LLC .

  

  

Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, BPM, Owner and the other parties
thereto have agreed to cooperate to effect the transfer of the Permits to
Owner or its designees, which transfer may occur subsequent to the Closing
Date.

  

  

As a condition to the Termination Agreement, and in order to effect the
transition from operation of the Oaktown Mine by BPM to operation by Owner or
its designee, BPM has agreed to enter into this Interim Operating Agreement.

  

  

In consideration of the premises and mutual covenants set forth herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  

  

AGREEMENT

  

  

INTERIM OPERATIONS. Subject to any required consent or approval by the
governmental authority that issues or administrates a Permit, BPM hereby
grants Owner and its designees the right to operate the Oaktown Mine under and
pursuant to the Permits, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, during the period from and after the Closing Date and continuing
until the date on which such Permits are transferred to Owner or its designee.
Owner and each of its designees shall operate solely as an independent
contractor and not as an agent, employee or servant of BPM. BPM shall have no
right or obligation in any way to direct, supervise or control the mining and
reclamation activities of Owner. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, as between BPM and Owner, all of Owner's operations shall be at the
sole cost and expense of Owner, and any benefit gained from such operations
shall likewise be for the sole account and benefit of Owner. To the extent
that the process of transferring the Permits has not been commenced prior to
the Closing Date, BPM agrees that Owner shall have the right (at its sole cost
and expense) to prepare, submit and obtain approval of any necessary
applications for the transfer or re-issuance of the Permits; provided that BPM
shall have an opportunity to review any such filing in advance. BPM and Owner
or its designee shall reasonably cooperate and coordinate with each other as
necessary for Owner or such designee to submit and obtain approvals for the
transfer or re-issuance of the Permits. None of Owner or its designees shall
receive any compensation from BPM, and BPM shall receive no compensation from
Owner in connection with the operations of the Oaktown Mine or the transfer or
re-issuance of the Permits as contemplated herein.

  

  

NOTICES.

  

  

If BPM or Owner receives a notice of violation, a cessation order or any other
correspondence, order, citation or communication of any kind under any of the
Permits following the Closing Date but before the transfer or re-issuance of a
Permit, BPM shall give Owner, or Owner shall give BPM, as applicable, prompt
written notice thereof. Any notice or other communication given under this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be: (i) delivered personally; (ii)
sent by documented overnight delivery service; (iii) sent by facsimile
transmission, provided that a confirmation copy thereof is sent no later than
the Business Day following the day of such transmission by documented
overnight delivery service or first class mail, postage prepaid (certified or
registered mail, return receipt requested); or (iv) sent by first class mail,
postage prepaid (certified or registered mail, return receipt requested). Such
notice shall be deemed to have been duly given: (w) on the date of the
delivery, if delivered personally; (x) on the Business Day after dispatch by
documented overnight delivery service, if sent in such manner; (y) on the date
of facsimile transmission, if so transmitted; or (z) on the fifth Business Day
after sent by first class mail, postage prepaid, if sent in such manner.

Any party may at any time change its address for service from time to time by
giving notice to the other party in accordance with this Section 3.

  

  

3. VIOLATIONS, ABATEMENT AND INSPECTION. (a) During the term of this Agreement, the Owner shall be responsible for compliance with all obligations of the terms of the Permits and all laws and regulations applicable to the Permits and the operations performed pursuant thereto (the "Permit Obligations"). If BPM or Owner receives a notice of violation, cessation order or other notice relating to a failure to comply with the Permit Obligations (a "Violation"), Owner will promptly take action to abate or otherwise resolve the Violation. Owner will give BPM notice when the Violation has been abated. (b) If Owner fails to timely abate a Violation, BPM shall notify Owner of its intention to undertake abatement activities. If after such notice, Owner does not undertake remedial action, BPM shall be entitled to undertake remedial actions on its own behalf. (c) During the term of this Agreement, BPM, its agents, engineers or other related persons on its behalf, shall have the right, but not the obligation, to enter onto the Oaktown Mine premises (the "Property"), for the purpose of ascertaining the condition of the operations located on the Property, and the status of Operator's compliance with the Permits, provided that BPM shall not in any event interfere with the operation at the Oaktown Mine or on the Property, and that BPM shall, and shall cause its representatives to, comply with all of Owner's (or its designee's) safety and security policies in effect at such time. BPM shall give Owner reasonable prior notice of its intent to make inspections or enter the Property and shall provide Owner (or its designee) with an opportunity to have Owner's representative accompany the representatives of BPM while they are on the Property. Operator shall cooperate in good faith to facilitate BPM's exercise its rights under this Section 3.

  

  

4. COVENANTS OF OWNER. Owner covenants to BPM that Owner will operate the Oaktown Mine and conduct coal mining and processing operations any other activity conducted under the Permits in substantial compliance with the Permits and any applicable laws, and Owner will not materially deviate from any methods of operation established as a condition of the Permits (as they may be amended) at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to receipt of written approval of such deviation from the relevant governmental authority or the transfer or reissuance of the relevant Permit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Owner or its designees shall be under any obligation, nor shall this Interim Operating Agreement be construed to impose any obligation on Owner or any of its designees, to conduct coal mining or processing operations on the Property.

  

  

5. INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF OWNER.

  

  

Owner will indemnify, defend and hold harmless BPM and its, assigns and
successors in interest, and each of their respective stockholders, members,
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and
representatives (the "BPM Indemnified Persons"), from and against any actions,
suits, proceedings, demands, claims, investigations, penalties, assessments,
judgments, costs, liabilities or expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees and court costs, incurred by any BPM Indemnified Person resulting from
any failure by Owner or its designee to comply with applicable law with
respect to the Oaktown Mine, including any surface operations related thereto
after the Closing Date and prior to the date on which the last of the Permits
is transferred or re-issued to Owner or its designees, or to operate the
Oaktown Mine after the Closing Date in accordance with a Permit, including any
citation, notice of violation or penalty assessed as a result of or in
connection with such failure, that occurs after the Closing Date and prior to
the date on which such Permit is transferred or re-issued to Owner or its
designee, in each case except to the extent directly resulting from the
negligence or intentional misconduct of any of the BPM Indemnified Persons
(any of the foregoing, a "BPM Indemnified Loss").

  

  

Promptly after the receipt by any BPM Indemnified Person of notice of the
commencement or assertion of any action, suit, proceeding, demand, claim or
investigation by a third party (an "Asserted Liability") that may result in a
BPM Indemnified Loss, such BPM Indemnified Person will give written notice
thereof (the "Claims Notice") to Owner. The failure to give such Claims Notice
shall not relieve Owner from any obligation hereunder, except to the extent
that such failure causes actual harm to BPM. Owner shall have the right to
assume the control of the defense of such Asserted Liability, at Owner's
expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to such BPM
Indemnified Person; provided, that Owner shall so notify such BPM Indemnified
Person that it will defend such Asserted Liability within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of such Claims Notice.

  

  

6. DURATION. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall automatically terminate without any action of the Parties as of the date on which Owner or its designee obtains the consent or approval of the relevant governmental authority to the transfer, assignment or re-issuance to Owner or its designee of the last of the Permits, and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the provisions of Sections 5 of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties thereunder arising during or relating to the period between the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

7. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Any assignment permitted to be made by either Owner or BPM to any person or entity pursuant to this Section 6 shall not relieve the assigning party from any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Owner may assign a security interest in this Agreement to its lenders and BPM hereby consents to such assignment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to restrict or prohibit Owner from designating the rights granted pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement or subcontracting for the performance of any or all of its activities or operations in connection with the Oaktown Mine.

  

  

8. MODIFICATION. No term or provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. No course of dealing between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

9. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Indiana (without reference to its rules as to conflicts of law).

  

  

10. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under applicable Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

11. WAIVER. The failure of any party hereto to insist on the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right, power or remedy upon breach hereof shall not limit such party's right thereafter to enforce any provision or exercise any right.

  

  

12. EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne solely and entirely by the party that has incurred such expenses. In the event of a dispute between or among the parties in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties hereto agrees that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other party or parties of reasonable expenses, including reasonable legal expenses, incurred in connection with any related action or proceeding.

  

  

13. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, ARBITRATION, INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION TO WHICH SUCH PARTY IS A PARTY INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

15. DUE AUTHORIZATION. BPM and Owner each represent and warrant to the other that (i) it has the power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver and carry out this Agreement, and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement has been, and the individual that executes this Agreement on behalf of BPM or Owner, respectively, has been, duly authorized by all proper and necessary corporate or limited liability company action.

Owner covenants to Five Star that Owner will operate the Prosperity Mine and conduct coal mining and processing operations any other activity conducted under the Permits in substantial compliance with the Permits and any applicable laws, and Owner will not materially deviate from any methods of operation established as a condition of the Permits (as they may be amended) at any time following the execution of this Agreement and prior to receipt of written approval of such deviation from the relevant governmental authority or the transfer or reissuance of the relevant Permit. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, none of Owner or its designees shall be under any obligation, nor shall this Interim Operating Agreement be construed to impose any obligation on Owner or any of its designees, to conduct coal mining or processing operations on the Property.

  

  

5. INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS OF OWNER.

  

  

Owner will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Five Star and its, assigns and
successors in interest, and each of their respective stockholders, members,
partners, directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys and
representatives (the "Five Star Indemnified Persons"), from and against any
actions, suits, proceedings, demands, claims, investigations, penalties,
assessments, judgments, costs, liabilities or expenses, including reasonable
attorneys' fees and court costs, incurred by any Five Star Indemnified Person
resulting from any failure by Owner or its designee to comply with applicable
law with respect to the Prosperity Mine, including any surface operations
related thereto after the Closing Date and prior to the date on which the last
of the Permits is transferred or re-issued to Owner or its designees, or to
operate the Prosperity Mine after the Closing Date in accordance with a
Permit, including any citation, notice of violation or penalty assessed as a
result of or in connection with such failure, that occurs after the Closing
Date and prior to the date on which such Permit is transferred or re-issued to
Owner or its designee, in each case except to the extent directly resulting
from the negligence or intentional misconduct of any of the Five Star
Indemnified Persons (any of the foregoing, a "Five Star Indemnified Loss").

  

  

Promptly after the receipt by any Five Star Indemnified Person of notice of
the commencement or assertion of any action, suit, proceeding, demand, claim
or investigation by a third party (an "Asserted Liability") that may result in
a Five Star Indemnified Loss, such Five Star Indemnified Person will give
written notice thereof (the "Claims Notice") to Owner. The failure to give
such Claims Notice shall not relieve Owner from any obligation hereunder,
except to the extent that such failure causes actual harm to Five Star. Owner
shall have the right to assume the control of the defense of such Asserted
Liability, at Owner's expense and with counsel of its choice reasonably
satisfactory to such Five Star Indemnified Person; provided, that Owner shall
so notify such Five Star Indemnified Person that it will defend such Asserted
Liability within fifteen (15) days after receipt of such Claims Notice.

  

  

6. DURATION. The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Closing Date and shall automatically terminate without any action of the Parties as of the date on which Owner or its designee obtains the consent or approval of the relevant governmental authority to the transfer, assignment or re-issuance to Owner or its designee of the last of the Permits, and shall thereafter be of no further force or effect. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, the provisions of Section 5 of this Agreement and the rights and obligations of the Parties thereunder arising during or relating to the period between the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

7. ASSIGNMENT. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party without the prior written consent of the other party hereto. Any assignment permitted to be made by either Owner or Five Star to any person or entity pursuant to this Section 6 shall not relieve the assigning party from any of its obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Owner may assign a security interest in this Agreement to its lenders and Five Star hereby consents to such assignment. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to restrict or prohibit Owner from designating the rights granted pursuant to Section 1 of this Agreement or subcontracting for the performance of any or all of its activities or operations in connection with the Prosperity Mine.

  

  

8. MODIFICATION. No term or provision of this Agreement may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated orally, except by an instrument in writing signed by the party against which enforcement of such change, waiver, discharge or termination is sought. No course of dealing between the parties shall be effective to amend or waive any provision of this Agreement.

  

  

9. GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement will be construed in accordance with and governed by the internal laws of the State of Indiana (without reference to its rules as to conflicts of law).

  

  

10. SEVERABILITY. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced under applicable Law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein are not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated herein are consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

  

  

11. WAIVER. The failure of any party hereto to insist on the strict performance of any provision of this Agreement or to exercise any right, power or remedy upon breach hereof shall not limit such party's right thereafter to enforce any provision or exercise any right.

  

  

12. EXPENSES. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne solely and entirely by the party that has incurred such expenses. In the event of a dispute between or among the parties in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the parties hereto agrees that the prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement by the other party or parties of reasonable expenses, including reasonable legal expenses, incurred in connection with any related action or proceeding.

  

  

13. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY CLAIM, ACTION, SUIT, ARBITRATION, INQUIRY, PROCEEDING OR INVESTIGATION TO WHICH SUCH PARTY IS A PARTY INVOLVING, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, ANY MATTER IN ANY WAY ARISING OUT OF, RELATED TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED IN THIS AGREEMENT.

  

  

14. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  

  

15.DUE AUTHORIZATION. Five Star and Owner each represent and warrant to the
other that (i) it has the power and authority to enter into, execute, deliver
and carry out this Agreement, and (ii) the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement has been, and the individual that executes this Agreement on
behalf of Five Star or Owner, respectively, has been, duly authorized by all
proper and necessary corporate or limited liability company action.

  

  

16. PARTIES IN INTEREST. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto and their successors and permitted assigns, and except for the rights of the Five Star Indemnified Persons as set forth in Section 5, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any other person or entity any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

4.2TRANSFER OF CONTRACTS. BPM agrees that, at the request of Oaktown 1 and
Oaktown 2, whether before or after the Closing, it will transfer to Oaktown 1
or Oaktown 2 or their designees such of the Mine Contracts as they may

under the Mine Contracts consistent with past practices and will continue to
communicate with the Vendors on behalf of Oaktown 1 and Oaktown 2 as it has in
the past. BPM will terminate all unassumed Mine Contracts as of the Closing,
and to the greatest extent reasonably possible will do so in such a manner as
to avoid any expense or liability to BPM, Oaktown 1 or Oaktown 2. Any
liability or expenses incurred by BPM as a result of such termination that
have been verified and approved by VUS in its reasonable discretion will
constitute a Mining Cost under the CMA and will be treated accordingly, except
to the extent they are Excluded Costs.

  


 

  

4.3PAYMENT OF VENDORS. BPM will use its reasonable best efforts to cause all
claims for payment asserted by the Vendors for goods or services provided by
them in connection with the Mines prior to the Closing ("Vendor Claims") to be
paid prior to, or as soon as possible after, the Closing. After the Closing,
BPM will continue to pay Vendor Claims, subject to VUS' verification and
approval of same in its reasonable discretion and to the extent that BPM had
not previously received funds for the payment thereof. BPM will cooperate with
VUS and will provide VUS with all the information necessary to (a) verify the
correctness of any unpaid pre-Closing Mine 1 Vendor charges and (b) to contest
any such charges that VUS deems unjustified or unreasonable.

  


 

  

4.4CERTIFICATE OF PAYMENT AND LIEN RELEASES. At the Closing BPM will provide
Oaktown 1, Oaktown 2 and VUS with a certificate in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 6 regarding the Vendor charges. At the Closing, and thereafter with
respect to the Vendors that have not been paid in full as of the Closing, BPM

execute such documents as may be necessary to facilitate such transfer of, the
Mine Permits to Oaktown 1 or Oaktown 2 or their designees free and clear of
all liens and encumbrances arising by or through BPM. To the extent the
permits are encumbered by liens to support a line of credit, BPM covenants
that it will not draw on that line of credit prior to the release of any such
liens. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no transfer of permits will be completed
unless or until any bond or other financial surety affecting BPM has been
replaced. BPM hereby releases any claim it may have to any accrual by Oaktown
1or Oaktown 2 or any of their affiliates for reclamation obligations.

indemnify and hold harmless BPM from and against all out-of-pocket expenses
associated with the litigation and/or resolution of the Mine 1 Permit

in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the CMA, have been verified
and approved by VUS in its reasonable discretion and are not Excluded Costs.

notify VUS of any claim, demand or right of action asserted or any action,

Mine 1 Permit Citations. After the Closing, before it commences any
negotiations or litigation with respect to any Mine 1 Permit Citation, and

recommendations and direction with respect to the conduct thereof. All
negotiations and litigation with respect to any Mine 1 Permit Citation will be
conducted by or at the direction of VUS, and BPM will not settle or pay any
Mine 1 Permit Citation without the prior consent of the VUS Representative. At

receipt of such request, Five Star will provide the notification to the
Employees required under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act
(the "WARN Act") regarding the termination of the Employees, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Prosperity. Prosperity will provide a form

compensation coverage and administering and resolving workers' compensation
claims, in accordance with the terms of the CMA and the current practice of
the parties in the performance of the CMA. Five Star represents that it has

list of all the Worker Claims as of the date of this Agreement. Five Star will
supplement Exhibit 2 as of the date of Closing.

  


 

  

  

7.6EMPLOYEE CERTIFICATE. At the Closing Five Star will provide a certification
in the form set forth in Exhibit 3 hereto that all the Employees have been
fully paid and provided with all applicable termination and other benefits to
which they are entitled, or if that is not the case, it will provide a
detailed list of unpaid wages and benefits.

  


 

  

7.7RESOLUTION OF WORKER CLAIMS. Following the Closing and the termination of
the CMA, (a) VUS will identify a representative to receive notices from Five
Star regarding any Worker Claims or any other matters for which VUS may have
any liability hereunder (the "VUS Representative"); (b) Five Star will
promptly notify the VUS Representative of any claim, demand or right of action
asserted or any action, suit or proceeding threatened or instituted with
regard to any Employee or any Worker Claim; (c) prior to the commencement of
any negotiations or litigation, and during the course thereof, with respect to
any Employee or Worker Claim, Five Star will consult with VUS to obtain its

VUS's option, VUS may assume (as Five Star's agent, designee or otherwise) the
management of any or all Claims relating to Employees or Worker Claims; (e)
all negotiations and litigation with respect to any Employee or any Worker
Claim will be conducted by or at the direction of VUS; (f) Five Star will
cooperate with VUS in the handling of any Worker Claim or the verification of

compliance with the terms and provisions of Section 3.7, VUS will indemnify
and hold harmless Five Star for any out-of pocket costs (including any
workers' compensation payments that are not covered by insurance) associated
with the litigation or resolution of any Worker Claims, provided that such
costs are reasonable, verified and approved by VUS in its reasonable
discretion, incurred in accordance with this Agreement and are not Excluded
Costs.

  


 

  

7.9PAYMENT OF LABOR COSTS. VUS will reimburse Five Star for any Direct Labor
and Associated Costs for the Employees which are properly incurred by Five

8.2TRANSFER OF CONTRACTS. Five Star agrees that, at the request of Prosperity,
whether before or after the Closing, it will transfer to Prosperity or its
designee such of the Contracts as Prosperity may request, so that the

its designee. Five Star will cooperate with Prosperity in transferring the
contracts and in establishing a relationship between Prosperity and the
Vendors. Notwithstanding the transfer of the Contracts, until the Closing,
Five Star will be responsible for fulfilling all of the obligations under the
Contracts and will continue to communicate with the Vendors on behalf of
Prosperity as it has in the past. Five Star will terminate all unassumed
Contracts as of the Closing, and to the greatest extent reasonably possible
will do so in such a manner as to avoid any expense or liability to Five Star
or Prosperity. Any liability or expenses incurred by Five Star as a result of
such termination that have been verified and approved by VUS in its reasonable
discretion will constitute a Mining Cost under the CMA and will be treated
accordingly.

  


 

  

8.3PAYMENT OF VENDORS. Five Star will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
all claims for payment asserted by the Vendors for goods or services provided
by them in connection with the Mine prior to the Closing ("Vendor Claims") to
be paid prior to, or as soon as possible after the Closing. After the Closing,
Five Star will continue to pay Vendor Claims, subject to VUS' verification and
approval of same in its reasonable discretion and to the extent that Five Star
had not previously received funds for the payment thereof. Five Star will
cooperate with VUS and will provide VUS with all the information necessary to
(a) verify the correctness of any unpaid pre-Closing the Vendor charges and
(b) to contest any such charges that VUS deems unjustified or unreasonable.

  


 

  

8.4CERTIFICATE OF PAYMENT AND LIEN RELEASES. At the Closing, Five Star will
provide Prosperity and VUS with a certificate in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 5 regarding the Vendor charges. At the Closing, and thereafter with

Star will also provide Prosperity and VUS with such lien waivers from the
Vendors as they may request.

transfer of, the Permits to Prosperity or its designee free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances arising by or through Five Star. To the extent the
permits are encumbered by liens to support a line of credit, Five Star
covenants that it will not draw on that line of credit prior to the release of
any such liens. No transfer of the permits will be completed unless and until
any bond or other financial surety affecting Five Star has been replaced. Five
Star hereby releases any claim it has or may have to any accrual by Prosperity
or any of its affiliates for reclamation obligations.

action, suit or proceeding threatened or instituted against Five Star with
regard to any Permit Citations. After the Closing, before it commences any

the conduct thereof. All negotiations and litigation with respect to any the

the VUS Representative. At the option of VUS, it may assume (as Five Star's

in the verification of any costs or expenses related thereto.

TERMINATION FEE

   
---|--- 
 

  


 

  

10.1 NO LUMP-SUM PAYMENT. The parties acknowledge and agree that more than
30,000,000 tons of coal have been mined from the reserves associated with the
Mine. Consequently, no lump-sum Termination Fee payment will be due to Five
Star pursuant to Section I.A.8 of the CMA on the termination of the CMA.

  


 

  

10.2 TERMINATION FEE. Following the Closing and the termination of the CMA, in
full satisfaction of the Termination Fee required by Section I.A.8 of the CMA,
Prosperity will pay to Five Star an amount equal to $.30 for each ton of clean
coal mined and sold after the Closing date from the reserves which are
currently part of the Mine plan, as and when such coal is mined, processed and
sold (the "Termination Fee"). For avoidance of doubt, the parties agree that
as of the date of this Agreement, the area constituting the Mine plan (the
"Mine Plan Area") is indicated on the map attached hereto as Exhibit 13. Any
reserve areas or mineral interests added to the Mine Plan Area will not be
subject to the Termination Fee.

  


 

  

10.3 PAYMENT TERMS. Following the Closing and the termination of the CMA,
Prosperity will pay Five Star the Termination Fee for each ton of clean coal
mined and sold from the Mine Plan Area after the Closing date. The payment
will be made by Prosperity on or before the twentieth (20th) day of the
calendar month following the month during which such coal was sold. The
payment will be made by check to Five Star at the address set forth in Section
16.3, below, as it may be amended in accordance with that Section. Five Star
will have reasonable access, on at least 72 hours' notice and during business
hours, for itself and its representatives to such records of Prosperity as may
be reasonably necessary for Five Star to confirm the accuracy of the
Termination Fee payments made to it.

  


 

  

10.4WAIVER OF TERMINATION NOTICE. Section X.B of the CMA requires Prosperity
to give Five Star six (6) months' notice of a voluntary termination of the
CMA. Five Star agrees that this Agreement serves as such notice, and that no
further notice will be required except for notice to Five Star of the
occurrence of the Closing.

  


 

  

  

10.5TERMINATION MANAGEMENT FEE. Within sixty (60) days following the Closing,
VUS will pay to FIVE STAR an amount equal to One Dollar ($1.00) multiplied
times the tons of: (a) coal contained in the clean coal stockpiles at the Mine
and (b) the clean coal equivalent contained in the raw coal stockpiles at the
Mine (determined based on the monthly mine production reports prepared in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance with past practice), in each
case for which Five Star has not already been paid its Management Fee provided
for in the CMA (the "Termination Management Fee").

  


 

  

10.6DEFICIENCY MANAGEMENT FEE. If the Closing occurs less than six (6) months
following the execution of this Agreement, the difference between the number
days following the execution of this Agreement and 180 days will be referred
to hereafter as the "Deficiency Period." Following the Closing, VUS will pay
to Five Star an amount equal to One Dollar and Thirty-Two and a Half Cents
($1.325) multiplied times the applicable number of tons for each day of the
Deficiency Period, based on the attached Exhibit 14 which as of the date of
this Agreement were budgeted to be shipped during the Deficiency Period (the
"Deficiency Management Fee"). Exhibit 15 shows budgeted tons on a monthly
basis. In determining the number of tons to be used in calculating the
Deficiency Management Fee, the budgeted tons for each day of the Deficiency
Period will be determined by dividing the monthly tons by the number of days
in the month.

  


 

  

10.7RELEASE OF PURCHASE OPTION. In addition to any other release contained
herein, upon the Closing and termination of the CMA, Five Star hereby releases
any claim to a right to purchase the Mine as provided in Section X.C of the

Oaktown Sales Marketing Agreement Dated May 25, 2010

   
---|--- 
 

  

  

Dear John:

  

  

As you may know, today Vectren publicly announced it has entered into an
agreement to sell Vectren Fuels, Inc. ("VFI"), which will include its
subsidiaries Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 1, LLC and Oaktown Fuels Mine No. 2, LLC.
As we discussed, this letter serves as notice to you that, upon closing of the
sale (the "Closing"), the above-referenced Sales Marketing Agreement (the
"Agreement") will be terminated. We do not expect the Closing to occur prior
to September 1, 2014, and it could close as late as the end of November.

  

  

We have appreciated your work in performing the agreement, and we value our
relationship with you. If the sale should not close, we will need Lafayette to
continue its good work for VFI, and we would not want the Agreement to
terminate. We recognize that Section 7 of the Agreement requires that we give
Lafayette 30 days' notice of termination. Consequently, we are sending you
this conditional notice of termination that the Agreement will terminate at
the Closing (which will be more than 30 days after the date of this letter),
if a Closing occurs. However, if the sale should not close, this notice will
be ineffective, and the Agreement will continue in effect uninterrupted.

  

  

If the Closing occurs and the Agreement terminates, VFI (under new ownership)
will perform its post-termination obligations to Lafayette by paying the
contract commissions on firm sales of coal as and when the payments for such
sales are received, in accordance with past practice. The attached schedule
shows the contracts or sales to which those post-termination commissions may
be applicable.

  

  

As we also discussed, we want to meet with you in the next few days to discuss
our current and future coal supply and sales situation and to discuss
Lafayette's activities under the Agreement between now and the Closing, if it
occurs.

  

  


 

  

  

  

Very Truly Yours,

Dear John:

  

  

As you may know, today Vectren publicly announced it has entered into an
agreement to sell Vectren Fuels, Inc. ("VFI"), which will include its
subsidiary Prosperity Mine, LLC. As we discussed, this letter serves as notice
to you that, at or following the closing of the sale (the "Closing"), the
above-referenced Sales Marketing Agreement (the "Agreement") will be
terminated. We do not expect the Closing to occur prior to September 1, 2014,
and it could close as late as the end of November.

  

  

We have appreciated your work in performing the agreement, and we value our
relationship with you. If the sale should not close, we will need Lafayette to
continue its good work for VFI, and we would not want the Agreement to
terminate. We recognize that Section 8 of the Agreement requires that we give
Lafayette 90 days' notice of termination. Consequently, we are sending you
this conditional notice of termination that the Agreement will terminate at
the Closing (if it is more than 90 days after the date of this letter), or 90
days after the date of this letter (if the Closing occurs sooner). However, if
the sale should not close, this notice will be ineffective, and the Agreement
will continue in effect uninterrupted.

  

  

If the Closing occurs and the Agreement terminates, VFI (under new ownership)
will perform its post-termination obligations to Lafayette by paying the
contract commissions on firm sales of coal as and when the payments for such
sales are received, in accordance with past practice. The attached schedule
