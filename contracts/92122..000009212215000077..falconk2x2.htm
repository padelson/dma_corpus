 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated August 23, 2015 (this "Agreement"), by and
among The Southern Company, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), AMS Corp., a
Georgia corporation and Parent Subsidiary ("Merger Sub"), and AGL Resources
Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "Company").

RECITALS

A. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), the Board of
Directors of Parent (the "Parent Board") and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
companies and shareholders to consummate the strategic business combination
transaction provided for in this Agreement in which Merger Sub will, on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, merge with
and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company being the surviving
corporation in the Merger.

B. The Parties desire to make or enter into certain representations,
warranties and covenants in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe
certain conditions to the Merger.

Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE I



THE MERGER

Section 1.1The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code
(the "GBCC"), Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub will cease, and the Company will continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation") and will succeed to and assume all
the rights and obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the GBCC.

Section 1.2Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Merger will take place
at the offices of Jones Day, 1420 Peachtree Street, N.E., Suite 800, Atlanta,
Georgia 30309, at 10:00 a.m. local time on the second Business Day following
the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII (other than those conditions that by their terms are
to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by Law, waiver of those conditions at Closing). The date on
which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing
Date."

Section 1.3Effective Time. On the Closing Date, Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company will cause to be delivered to the Secretary of State of the State of
Georgia for filing a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents
(collectively, the "Certificate of Merger") executed in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the GBCC and will make all other filings or recordings required under the GBCC. The Merger
will become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed
by such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company
will agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger
becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

Section 1.4Effects. The Merger will have the effects provided in this
Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the GBCC.

Section 1.5Conversion of Securities.

(a)Conversion of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holders of Company Common Stock, each share of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Share") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than Dissenting Shares and any Shares to be cancelled pursuant to
Section 1.5(b)) will be converted automatically into the right to receive, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, $66.00 in cash (the "Merger
Consideration"), payable in the manner set forth in Section 2.1. At the
Effective Time and as a result of the Merger, all such Shares will cease to be
outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented any such outstanding Shares ("Certificates") and each holder of
any such Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are
not represented by Certificates ("Book-Entry Shares") will thereafter cease to
have any rights with respect to such Shares except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, to be paid, without interest, in consideration therefor
upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate,
Section 2.1(h)).

(b)Cancellation of Certain Shares. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned of record by
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time will
automatically be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution will be made with respect thereto.

(c)Shares of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.01, of Merger Sub will be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 1.6Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws.

(a)The Company Charter in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

(b)At the Effective Time, the Company Bylaws will, by virtue of the Merger, be
amended and restated in their entirety to read as the Merger Sub Bylaws as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and as so amended and
restated will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

Section 1.7Directors. The Parties will take all necessary action such that,
from and after the Effective Time, the directors of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will become the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

Section 1.8Officers. The Parties will take all necessary action such that,
from and after the Effective Time, the officers of the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time will become the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case
may be.

ARTICLE II

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

Section 2.1Exchange of Shares.

(a)Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will (i) designate a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act
as agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging Shares for the
Merger Consideration and (ii) enter into an agreement reasonably acceptable to
the Company with the Exchange Agent relating to the services to be performed
by the Exchange Agent. Parent will deposit or will cause to be deposited with
the Exchange Agent at or prior to the Effective Time, cash in an amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a) (the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund will be invested by the Exchange Agent as
directed by Parent. Any interest or other income from such investments will be
paid to and become income of Parent. The Exchange Fund will not be used for
any other purpose. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such
investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level
required to make prompt cash payment as contemplated to be paid pursuant to
this Article II, Parent will promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events to ensure that the
Exchange Fund is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the
Exchange Agent to promptly make such cash payments.

(b)Exchange Procedures.

(i)As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event
within two Business Days, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to mail (and,
to the extent commercially practicable, Parent will, or will cause the
Exchange Agent to, make available for collection by hand, during customary
hours commencing immediately after the Effective Time, if so elected by a
holder of Shares) to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record
of Shares (other than the Depository Trust Company ("DTC")) entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.5(a): (A) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title will pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares,
upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal), and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such holder's
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment of the Merger
Consideration issuable and payable in respect thereof pursuant to such letter
of transmittal; provided, however, that Parent will be required to obtain the
Company's approval of such letter of transmittal and instructions prior to the
Effective Time (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld). Exchange of
any Book-Entry Shares will be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agent's
customary procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry.

(ii)Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent
for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may be reasonably required by the Exchange Agent or Parent
(or in the case of DTC, the customary surrender procedures of DTC and the
Exchange Agent), the holder of such Shares will be entitled to receive in
exchange for such properly surrendered Shares an amount in cash equal to the
product (rounded to the nearest cent) of (A) the number of Shares represented
by such holder's properly surrendered Certificates and Book-Entry Shares and
(B) the Merger Consideration.

(c)No Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger Consideration paid
upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the
terms of this Article II will be deemed to have been paid, as the case may be,
in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

(d)Adjustments. Without limiting in any way the covenants in Sections 5.1 and
5.2, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of
the Company occurs as a result of any reclassification, recapitalization,
stock split (including a reverse stock split) or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a
record date during such period, the Merger Consideration will be equitably
adjusted to reflect such change.

(e)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to the holders
of Shares on the date that is one year after the Effective Time will be
delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders of Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II will thereafter look only to Parent
for the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
1.5(a). 

(f)No Liability. None of the Exchange Agent, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be liable to any holder of Shares for any Merger
Consideration from the Exchange Fund or other cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares as of a
date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent free and clear of
any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(g)Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent,
Parent and Merger Sub will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
the Treasury Regulations, any provision of applicable state, local or foreign
Tax Law or any other Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts will be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

(h)Lost Certificates. In the event that any Certificate will have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration; except that Parent may, in
its reasonable discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such
Merger Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such reasonable and customary amount as it
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent,
Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to
the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 2.2Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed and there will be no further registration
of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason will be cancelled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration with respect to the Shares formerly represented by
such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to which the holders thereof are
entitled pursuant to Section 1.5(a).

Section 2.3Company Stock Awards.

(a)Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option award to purchase Shares
granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plans (each, a "Company Stock
Option") that is vested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time will be cancelled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive
an amount in cash, payable in accordance with Section 2.3(f), equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Stock Option
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Share of such
Company Stock Option. 

(b)Company Restricted Shares. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted
Shares granted under the Company Equity Incentive Plans (each, a "Company
Restricted Share") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will be deemed to be fully vested (without proration or other
reduction in respect of the portion of the applicable vesting period elapsed)
and will be cancelled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an
amount in cash, payable in accordance with Section 2.3(f), equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such award of Company
Restricted Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the
Merger Consideration, together with any dividends credited thereto in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(c)Company RSUs. At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units
payable in whole or in part in Shares, or the value of which is determined
with reference to the value of Shares, and granted under the Company Equity
Incentive Plans (each, a "Company RSU") that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be deemed to be fully vested (without
proration or other reduction in respect of the portion of the applicable
vesting period elapsed) and will be cancelled, with the holder thereof
becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash, payable in accordance with
Section 2.3(f), equal to the product of (i) the total number of Shares subject
to such award of Company RSUs as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
(based on the achievement of applicable performance criteria, if any) and (ii)
the Merger Consideration, together with any dividends credited thereto in
accordance with the terms of the applicable award agreement.

(d)Company PSUs. At the Effective Time, each award of performance share units
payable in whole or in part in Shares, or the value of which is determined
with reference to the value of Shares, and granted under the Company Equity
Incentive Plans (each, a "Company PSU") that is outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will be assumed by Parent and converted (without
proration or other reduction in respect of the portion of the applicable
performance period elapsed) into an award of restricted stock units by Parent
(an "Assumed Award") with respect to a number of shares of common stock of
Parent, par value $5 per share ("Parent Common Stock"), equal to the product
of (i) the greater of (A) 125% of the number of units underlying such Company
PSU based on target level of achievement of all relevant performance goals and
(B) the number of units underlying such Company PSU based on the actual level
of achievement of all relevant performance goals against target as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (as adjusted to the extent equitably
required), as determined by the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee thereof) prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the
Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole share), on the same terms and
conditions relating to vesting schedule and payment terms, and otherwise on
similar terms and conditions, as were applicable to such Company PSU as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except (1) as otherwise described in
this Section 2.3 or in Section 2.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and (2)
that such Assumed Award will not be subject to any performance goals and the
vesting of such Assumed Award will be based solely on the continued service of
the holder thereof. If a participant dies or becomes Disabled (with such term
as defined in the Company's Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan) or, if within
two years after the Effective Time, a participant's employment is terminated without "Cause" or
the participant resigns for "Good Reason" (with such terms as defined in the
Company Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan or, as applicable, a continuity
agreement between the participant and the Company), then all time-based
vesting restrictions on such participant's outstanding Assumed Awards will
lapse on a prorated basis based on the length of time during the vesting
period (measured from the vesting commencement date of the corresponding
Company PSU) that has elapsed prior to such participant's date of termination
of employment. For purposes of this Section 2.3, "Exchange Ratio" means a
fraction, the numerator of which is the Merger Consideration and the
denominator of which is the volume-weighted average price per share of Parent
Common Stock on the NYSE (as reported by Bloomberg L.P. or, if not reported
therein, in another authoritative source mutually selected by Parent and the
Company) on each of the five consecutive trading days ending on (and inclusive
of) the trading day that is two trading days immediately prior to the Closing
Date.

(e)Deferred Stock Units. At the Effective Time, each award of Company Deferred
Stock Units that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be cancelled, with the holder thereof becoming entitled to receive an
amount in cash, payable in accordance with Section 2.3(f), equal to the
product of (i) the total number of Shares subject to such award of Company
Deferred Stock Units as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
the Merger Consideration, together with any dividends credited thereto in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Deferred Compensation
Plan.

(f)Payment. As soon as reasonably practicable (but in no event later than two
Business Days) following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will
pay the amounts due to the holders of Company Stock Options pursuant to
Section 2.3(a), the amounts due to the holders of Company Restricted Shares
pursuant to Section 2.3(b) and the amounts due to the holders of Company RSUs
pursuant to Section 2.3(c), in each case without interest and subject to any
required Tax withholding. The Surviving Corporation will pay the amounts due
to the holders of Company Deferred Stock Units pursuant to Section 2.3(e) in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Deferred Compensation
Plan. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will pay any
amounts due in respect of all Assumed Awards pursuant to the terms of such
Assumed Awards. To the extent any amounts described in this Section 2.3(f)
relate to a Company Stock Award that is nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the Code, the Surviving Corporation will pay such
amounts at the earliest time permitted under the terms of the applicable
agreement, plan or arrangement relating to such Company Stock Award that will
not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

(g)Notice. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will be permitted (but not
obligated) to send a written notice in a form reasonably acceptable to Parent
to each holder of an outstanding Company Stock Option, Company Restricted
Share, Company RSU, Company PSU and Company Deferred Stock Unit (the "Company
Stock Awards") that will inform such holder of the treatment of such awards as
provided in this Section 2.3, and otherwise setting forth such holder's rights
pursuant to the applicable Company Equity Incentive Plan, Company Deferred Compensation Plan
and equity award agreements.

(h)Further Assurances. The Company will, prior to the Effective Time, take (or
cause to be taken) any and all actions as may be necessary (including
obtaining any resolutions of the Company Board and, to the extent required,
any committee thereof) to implement the foregoing provisions of this Section
2.3. In addition, Parent may reasonably request, after consultation with the
Company, that the Company obtain consents from certain holders of Company PSUs
prior to the Effective Time with respect to the treatment of such holders'
Company PSUs pursuant to Section 2.3(d). If the Company is not able to obtain
any such consent prior to the Effective Time, then, notwithstanding the terms
of Section 2.3(d), Parent may elect to not assume the Company PSUs held by
such holder, in which case such Company PSUs will be treated as set forth
under the Company Omnibus Performance Incentive Plan for awards not assumed or
substituted by the surviving entity, and Parent will notify the Company of
such election as soon as practicable.

(i)No Further Rights. Other than with respect to Assumed Awards relating to
Parent Common Stock, following the Effective Time, no holder of a Company
Stock Award, participant in any Company Equity Incentive Plan or other Company
Benefit Plan or employee benefit arrangement of the Company or party to any
employment agreement with the Company will have any right hereunder to acquire
any capital stock or other Equity Interests (including any "phantom" stock or
stock appreciation rights) in the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the
Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.4Treatment of Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Except as otherwise
provided in this Section 2.4, each current "Offering Period" (as defined in
the Company ESPP) (an "Offering Period") in progress as of the date of this
Agreement under the Company ESPP will continue, and the Shares will be issued
to participants thereunder on the next currently scheduled purchase dates
thereunder occurring after the date of this Agreement as provided under, and
subject to the terms and conditions of, the Company ESPP. New Offering Periods
under the Company ESPP will be permitted to commence following the date of
this Agreement in the ordinary course of business. Any Offering Period in
progress as of the Effective Time will be shortened, and the last day of each
such Offering Period will be the tenth Business Day immediately preceding the
Effective Time. Each then outstanding ESPP Purchase Right will be exercised
automatically on the last day of such Offering Period. Notwithstanding any
restrictions on transfer of stock in the Company ESPP, the treatment in the
Merger of any Shares under this provision will be in accordance with Section
2.1(a). The Company will terminate the Company ESPP as of or prior to the
Effective Time. The Company will, promptly after the date of this Agreement,
take all actions (including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the Company
ESPP) that are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Section 2.4.

Section 2.5Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and are held by a shareholder who is entitled to exercise, and properly
exercises, dissenters' rights with respect to such Shares (each, a "Dissenting
Shareholder") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the
provisions of the GBCC (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") will not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective
Time (except as provided in this Section 2.5). At the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Shareholder will cease to have any rights to such Dissenting Shares
except for the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares as may be determined to be due in accordance with the GBCC, except that
all Dissenting Shares held by any Dissenting Shareholder who will have failed
to perfect or who otherwise will have withdrawn, in accordance with the GBCC,
or lost such Dissenting Shareholder's rights to demand payment in respect of
such Dissenting Shares under the GBCC, will thereupon be deemed to have been
converted into the right to receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Article I and Article II, less applicable
withholding Taxes, if any, required to be withheld. The Company will not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make (or cause or
permit to be made on its behalf) any payment with respect to, or settle or
make a binding offer to settle with, any Dissenting Shareholder regarding its
exercise of dissenters' rights prior to the Effective Time. The Company will
give Parent notice of any such demands prior to the Effective Time, and Parent
will have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to any exercise by any shareholder of dissenters' rights.

material respect the Company's ability to report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other

nothing in this Agreement will require (and reasonable best efforts will in no
event require) Parent or any of its Affiliates to, and, without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent may be withheld at Parent's sole
discretion), the Company will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to,
offer, accept or agree, or commit to agree, to, any undertaking, term,
condition, liability, obligation, commitment or sanction in connection with
the consummation of the Transactions that, individually or in the aggregate,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Burdensome Effect.

(iii)The Parties will cooperate with one another in seeking to obtain the
Regulatory Approvals or any other filings made with or written materials
submitted to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions or
that would or would reasonably be expected to materially impact the post-
Closing operations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, including in
coordinating the timing of all such filings and discussions with Governmental
Entities.

(iv)Without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company will not agree
to, or accept, any agreements, commitments or conditions in connection with
the Merger pursuant to any settlement or otherwise with any Governmental
Entity or any other Person. Without the prior written consent of the Company,
Parent will not agree to, or accept, any agreements, commitments or conditions
in connection with the Merger pursuant to any settlement or otherwise with any
Governmental Entity or any other Person affecting the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries to the extent any such agreement, commitment or condition is
effective prior to the Effective Time.

(v)Nothing in this Section 6.1 will limit any applicable rights a Party may
have to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 in a case where
Section 8.1 permits such termination.

Section 6.2Proxy Statement; Shareholder Approval.

(a)As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
the Company will prepare and file a preliminary Proxy Statement with the SEC.
Subject to Section 6.9, the Proxy Statement will include the Company Board
Recommendation. Parent will cooperate with the Company in the preparation and
filing of the Proxy Statement and will furnish all information concerning it
that is necessary in connection with the preparation of the Proxy Statement
and is reasonably requested by the Company. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable after such filing and the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's shareholders, in each case as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the Company learns that the Proxy Statement will not be reviewed or that
the SEC staff has no further comments thereon. Prior to filing or mailing the
Proxy Statement or filing any other required documents (or in each case, any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company will provide Parent with an opportunity to review
and comment on such document or response (including by participating in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC) and will give good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent and its counsel. The Company will notify Parent
promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of any
request by the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and will supply Parent with copies of
all correspondence between the Company and the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Proxy Statement or the Transactions.

(b)If, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company or Parent that
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
will as promptly as practicable notify the other Party and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information will be filed with the SEC
as promptly as practicable after the other Party has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. The Proxy
Statement will comply as to form and substance in all material respects with
the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and other applicable Law,
including the regulations and requirements of NYSE.

(c)The Company will call a meeting of its shareholders to be held as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Proxy Statement is cleared by the SEC staff
for mailing to consider and vote on approval of this Agreement and any other
matters required to be voted upon by the Company's shareholders in connection
with the Transactions (including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
"Company Shareholders Meeting"). Subject to and until the Company Board
effects a Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section 6.9(c), the Company
Board will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from its shareholders the
Company Shareholder Approval. Subject to Section 6.9(c), the Company Board
will recommend that its shareholders vote in favor of approval of this
Agreement (the "Company Board Recommendation"). Subject to the Company's right
to terminate this Agreement under Section 8.1(d)(ii), the Company and Parent
agree that the Company's obligations pursuant to the first two sentences of
this Section 6.2(c) will not be affected by the commencement, public proposal
or communication to the Company of any Alternative Proposal, or by the
withdrawal or modification by the Company Board of the Company Board
Recommendation. 

Section 6.3Access to Information.

(a)Upon reasonable advance notice, the Company will, and will cause each
Company Subsidiary to, afford to Parent and to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, lenders, financial advisors and other Representatives of
Parent reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior
to the Effective Time to all the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' owned
or leased properties, books, Contracts, commitments, personnel (including
contractors and distributors), records, Tax Returns and all other information
concerning its business, operations, status of compliance with Environmental
Law, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; except that
Parent and its Representatives will conduct any such activities in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and except further that such access will
not include any intrusive, invasive or other sampling or testing (including
any Phase II environmental assessments) of any environmental media or any
physical assets of the Company; and except further that the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will not be required to provide any access or disclose
any information if such access or disclosure would (i) contravene any
applicable Law, (ii) jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
institution in possession or control of such information, (iii) result in the
disclosure of any Trade Secrets of third parties or (iv) contravene any
binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b)All information and materials provided pursuant to this Agreement will be
subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement entered into
between the Company and Parent as of August 2, 2015 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement").

(c)No investigation by either of the Parties or their respective
Representatives will affect the representations and warranties of the other
set forth in this Agreement.

Section 6.4Employee Matters.

(a)Continuation of Compensation and Benefits. Parent will, and will cause its
Affiliates to, continue the employment effective immediately after the Closing
Date of all Employees of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the
Closing Date (the "Company Employees"), including each such Employee on
medical, disability, family or other leave of absence as of the Closing Date.
For a period of one year following the Effective Time (the "Continuation
Period"), Parent will, or will cause its Affiliates to, provide each Company
Employee with compensation and benefits that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation and benefits, taken as a whole (including
equity-based compensation opportunities and severance benefits), provided to
such Company Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time; except
that each such Company Employee's annual base salary or wage rate will be no
less favorable than those provided to such Company Employee as of the
Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 6.4(a) will obligate Parent, Surviving
Corporation or the Company to continue the employment of any Company Employee
for any specific period. 

(b)Employee Service Credit. Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, (i)
give each Company Employee credit for service with the Company and any Company
Subsidiary or predecessor employer prior to the Closing Date, to the same
extent recognized by the Company or any Company Subsidiary in a comparable
Company Benefit Plan, under any employee benefit plans or personnel policies
maintained by Parent or its Affiliates, for all purposes (including
eligibility to participate, vesting in eligible benefits and levels of
benefits) other than for benefit accrual purposes under a defined benefit
pension plan; except that Company Employees will not be entitled to the
benefit of any grandfathered benefit formula that would not be provided to any
employee first hired by Parent on or after the Effective Time, (ii) allow each
Company Employee to participate in each Company Benefit Plan and any employee
benefit plan maintained by Parent or its Affiliates providing welfare benefits
(including medical, life insurance, long-term disability insurance and long-
term care insurance) in the plan year in which the Closing occurs without
regard to preexisting-condition limitations, waiting periods, evidence of
insurability or other exclusions or limitations, and (iii) credit each Company
Employee in the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs with any expenses
that were covered by the Company Benefit Plans for purposes of determining
deductibles, co-pays and other applicable limits under each Company Benefit
Plan with respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or its
Affiliates in which such Company Employee participates during such plan year
in which the Effective Time occurs.

(c)Vacation Pay and Personal Holidays. From and after the Effective Time,
Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, continue to credit to each
Company Employee all vacation and personal holiday pay that such Company
Employee is entitled to use but has not used as of the Closing Date (including
any earned vacation or personal holiday pay to be used in future years)
subject to Parent's vacation day carryover policy, beginning with the year
following the year in which the Effective Time occurs.

(d)Certain Commitments. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and
will cause its Affiliates to, treat the Transactions as constituting a "change
in control," "change of control" or similar terms under the Company Benefit
Plans and any such other Company compensation and severance arrangements or
agreements.

(e)Bonus Plans. Parent will, and will cause its Affiliates to, operate the
Company's annual incentive plan and all other annual bonus arrangements
(collectively, "Bonus Plans"), in effect on the date hereof, or such future
plans as may be established by the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board, consistent with the parameters set forth on Section 6.4(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, for annual performance periods commencing after the
date hereof and running through the Effective Time, which such future plans
will be consistent with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries' business
plans and past practice. With respect to the remainder of the fiscal year for
the fiscal year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will, and will
cause its Affiliates, to permit Company Employees to participate on a pro rata
basis in Parent bonus arrangements in accordance with terms established in the
ordinary course. 

(f)Retention Plan. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will establish a
retention plan for the benefit of certain employees of the Surviving
Corporation. In addition, the Company and Parent agree to cooperate in taking
additional actions in order to promote the retention and ensure the continuity
of key management, which may include the amendment of certain existing
continuity agreements entered into between the Company and certain members of
key management and the grant of certain retention equity awards in connection
therewith.

(g)No Third Party Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Section 6.4 will create any
right or obligation which is enforceable by any Employee or any other Person
with respect to any terms or conditions of employment, including the benefits
and compensation described in this Section 6.4. For the avoidance of doubt,
any amendments to the Company's, the Company Subsidiaries', Parent's and the
Surviving Corporation's benefit and compensation plans, programs or
arrangements will occur only in accordance with their respective terms and
will be pursuant to action taken by the Company, the Company Subsidiaries,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation which are independent of the consummation
of this Agreement or any continuing obligations hereunder.

Section 6.5Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a)From the Effective Time and ending on the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless (including by advancing expenses) each current and
former director and officer of the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries, each Employee and each person who served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such
service was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party" and, collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against all claims, liabilities, losses, damages,
judgments, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including fees and expenses
of legal counsel) in connection with any actual or threatened claim, suit,
action, proceeding or investigation (whether civil, criminal, administrative
or investigative) (each, a "Claim"), whenever asserted, arising out of,
relating to or in connection with any action or omission relating to their
position with the Company or the Company Subsidiaries occurring or alleged to
have occurred before or at the Effective Time (including any Claim relating in
whole or in part to the Agreement or the Transactions), to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law. Each of (x) the respective organizational
documents of each of the Company Subsidiaries as currently in effect and (y)
any indemnification agreements with an Indemnified Party listed on Section
6.5(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, which will in each case survive the
Transactions and continue in full force and effect to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, will not, for a period of six years from the Effective Time,
be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties except, in the case of
clauses (x) and (y), as required by applicable Law. Without limiting the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent
will cause the Surviving Corporation to cause the certificate of incorporation
and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation to include provisions for limitation of liabilities of Indemnified
Parties, indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the
Indemnified Parties no less favorable to the Indemnified Parties than as set
forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws in effect on the date of this
Agreement, which provisions will, for a period of six years from the Effective
Time, not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in a manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties except as
required by applicable Law.

(b)Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is unable
to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time from the Company's current
insurance carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Company's current insurance carrier with respect to directors'
and officers' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance (the "DandO
Insurance") for the persons who, as of the date of this Agreement, are covered
by the Company's existing DandO Insurance. Such "tail" insurance policies will
have terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least as
favorable as the Company's existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions). Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain such "tail" insurance policies in full force
and effect for their full term. If the Company and the Surviving Corporation
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance policies as of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect, at no expense to the
Indemnified Parties, for a period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time, the Company's DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement, or, if such insurance is unavailable, the Surviving
Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase
the best available DandO Insurance for such six-year period from an insurance
carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Company's current
insurance carrier with respect to the Company's existing DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and with levels of coverage at least as
favorable as provided in the Company's existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement; except that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will
be required to pay an aggregate premium for such insurance policies in excess
of $3,500,000; and if the premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such
amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation will be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

(c)The provisions of this Section 6.5 are (i) intended to be for the benefit
of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for or limitation of, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise. 

(d)In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision will be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, will assume all of the obligations
thereof set forth in this Section 6.5.

Section 6.6Additional Agreements. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, in case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is
necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest
the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of the Company, the then-current officers
and directors of each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will use
their respective reasonable best efforts to take all such actions as may be
reasonably requested by Parent.

Section 6.7Advice of Changes. Each of Parent and the Company will promptly
advise the other of any change or event, of which it has knowledge, (a) having
or reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or a Company
Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be, or (b) that would or would be
reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement if it
would result in the failure of closing conditions in Section 7.3(a) or Section
7.3(b), or Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b), respectively, by the Outside
Date, except that (i) no such notification will affect the representations,
warranties or covenants of the Parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or
the conditions to the obligations of the Parties under this Agreement and (ii)
a failure to comply with this Section 6.7 will not constitute the failure of
any condition set forth in Article VII to be satisfied unless the underlying
Parent Material Adverse Effect, Company Material Adverse Effect or material
breach would independently result in the failure of a condition set forth in
Article VII to be satisfied. The Company will promptly advise Parent of all
developments in, and the receipt of all communications from any Governmental
Entities with respect to, the matters described in Section 5.2(e) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. The Company will provide Parent with copies of all
submissions to any Governmental Entity with respect to such matters, and
provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in the preparation for all
meetings with any Governmental Entity with respect to such matters.

Section 6.8Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, each of Parent and
the Company will take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary or
advisable to cause the Transactions, including any dispositions of Shares
(including derivative securities with respect to such Shares) by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 6.9No Solicitation or Change of Recommendation.

(a)No Solicitation. 

(i)Except as set forth in Section 6.9(a)(ii) and Section 6.9(a)(iii), the
Company agrees that none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective officers, managers or directors (collectively, the
"Company Non-Solicit Parties") will, and that they will instruct and cause
their respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

(A)initiate, solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries,
discussions regarding, or the making or submission of, any proposal, request
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Alternative Proposal;

(B)approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any Contract or agreement in
principle, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than Parent and
Merger Sub) concerning any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar Contract concerning an Alternative Proposal (other
than negotiating and entering into a confidentiality and standstill agreement
as described in Section 6.9(a)(iii)) (an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement");

(C)terminate, amend, release, modify, or fail to enforce any provision of, or
grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill, confidentiality
or similar Contract entered into by the Company or a Company Subsidiary in
respect of or in contemplation of an Alternative Proposal (other than to the
extent the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, that failure to take any such actions
under this Section 6.9(a)(i)(C) would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties or obligations under applicable Law);

(D)conduct, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal (other than with the Company's
Representatives);

(E)furnish any non-public information relating to the Company, or afford
access to the books or records or Representatives of the Company, to any third
party that, to the knowledge of the Company, after consultation with its
Representatives, is seeking to or may make, or has made, an Alternative
Proposal;

(F)take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable to
any transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal; or

(G)resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.9(a)(i) will prohibit
the Company Non-Solicit Parties from contacting any Person who has made a Bona
Fide Alternative Proposal solely to request clarification of the terms and
conditions thereof to the extent necessary to permit the Company Board to
determine whether such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior
Proposal.

(ii)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
the conditions in Section 6.9(a)(iii) and solely in response to a Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Non-Solicit Parties may, with
respect to the Person that has made such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal:

(A)in response to a request therefor by such Person, provide information or
afford access to the books and records or Representatives of the Company, to
such Person (and its Representatives); and

(B)engage or participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person (and
its Representatives) with respect to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal.

(iii)The Company may not take the actions described in Section 6.9(a)(ii)
unless, prior to taking any such action:

(A)the Company has received from such Person an executed confidentiality and
standstill agreement on terms that are no less restrictive than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and compliant with the last
sentence of Section 6.9(g));

(B)the Company has delivered to Parent written notice prior to taking any such
action (1) stating that the Company Board intends to take such action and (2)
stating that the Company Board has made the determination set forth in Section
6.9(a)(iii)(C); and

(C)the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside financial and legal advisors, that such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior Proposal.

(iv)Without limiting Section 6.9(a)(iii), if the Company provides any non-
public information to any Person in reliance on Section 6.9(a)(ii) that has
not previously been provided to Parent, then the Company will provide such
information promptly to Parent.

(b)No Change of Recommendation. Except as set forth in Section 6.9(c), no
Company Non-Solicit Party will: 

(i)withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation;

(ii)fail to announce publicly, within 10 Business Days after a tender offer or
exchange offer relating to any securities of the Company has been commenced,
that the Company Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;

(iii)fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
distributed to the Company's shareholders in connection with the Transactions;

(iv)approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

(v)resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any such prohibited
action described in Section 6.9(b)(i) through this Section 6.9(b)(v) being
referred to as a "Change of Recommendation");

except that the making of any determination of the Company Board (or any
committee thereof) to provide, or the provision of, a Superior Proposal Notice
or an Intervening Event Notice in compliance with the terms of this Agreement
will not, in and of itself, be deemed a Change of Recommendation.

(c)Certain Permitted Changes of Recommendation. Subject to Section 6.9(d), at
any time prior to receiving the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company
Board may effect, or cause the Company to effect, as the case may be, a Change
of Recommendation if: (i) the Company Board determines (A) that after
complying with Section 6.9(d)(i), a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal or (B) after complying with Section 6.9(d)(ii), an
Intervening Event has occurred and is continuing and (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and
legal advisors, that, in light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event,
as the case may be, (A) the Transactions are not in the best interests of the
Company's shareholders and (B) the failure to effect such Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties or
obligations under applicable Law.

(d)Procedure Prior to Change of Recommendation.

(i)Superior Proposal. The Company Board will be entitled to effect, or cause
the Company to effect, prior to receiving the Company Shareholder Approval, a
Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent
permitted under Section 6.9(c)), only if (A) the Company has delivered to
Parent a written notice (a "Superior Proposal Notice") (1) stating that the
Company Board intends to take such actions pursuant to Section 6.9(c), (2)
stating that the Company Board has made the determinations set forth in
Section 6.9(c)(i)(A) and Section 6.9(c)(ii) and (3) including an unredacted
copy of such Superior Proposal and an unredacted form of any proposed
Alternative Acquisition Agreement related to such Superior Proposal and (B) the Negotiation Period has expired. During the four Business Day
period commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of such Superior Proposal
Notice (such period, as may be extended pursuant to this Section 6.9(d)(i),
the "Negotiation Period"), the Company will engage, and will cause its
Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith
negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding
an amendment of this Agreement so that the Alternative Proposal that is the
subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior Proposal. Each
time the financial or other material terms or conditions of such Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal (or terms or conditions related thereto, such as the
proposed equity and debt financing) are amended or modified, the Company will
be required to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice (including, as
attachments thereto, amended forms of the written Alternative Acquisition
Agreements relating to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal) and the
Negotiation Period will be extended by an additional two Business Days from
the date of Parent's receipt of such new Superior Proposal Notice.

(ii)The Company Board will be entitled to effect, or cause the Company to
effect, a Change of Recommendation in connection with an Intervening Event (to
the extent permitted under Section 6.9(c)), only if (A) the Company has
delivered to Parent a written notice (an "Intervening Event Notice") (1)
stating that the Company Board intends to take such actions pursuant to
Section 6.9(c), (2) stating that the Company Board has made the determinations
set forth in Sections 6.9(c)(i)(B) and 6.9(c)(ii) and (3) including a summary,
in all material respects, of the Intervening Event and (B) the Intervening
Event Negotiation Period has expired. During the four Business Day period
commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of such Intervening Event Notice
(such period, as may be extended pursuant to this Section 6.9(d)(ii), the
"Intervening Event Negotiation Period"), the Company will engage, and will
cause its Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in good
faith negotiations with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that the Company Board would no
longer be permitted to take such actions pursuant to Section 6.9(c). Each time
there is a material change to the facts or circumstances relating to the
Intervening Event, the Company will be required to deliver to Parent a new
Intervening Event Notice (including, as attachments thereto, a summary of the
changes to the facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening Event) and
the Intervening Event Negotiation Period will be extended by an additional two
Business Days from the date of Parent's receipt of such new Intervening Event
Notice.

(e)Certain Permitted Disclosure. Nothing contained in Section 6.9(a) will be
deemed to prohibit the Company or the Company Board (or any committee thereof)
from (i) complying with Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, including any "stop, look and listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act,
or (ii) making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) failure to do so would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties or obligations under
applicable Law; except that any such position or disclosure will be deemed a
Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly and concurrently
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation.

(f)Existing Discussions. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and
its and their respective Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any discussions or negotiations with, or any solicitation or
intentional assistance or encouragement of, any Person with respect to any
Alternative Proposal (or that could reasonably be expected to lead to or
result in an Alternative Proposal) which are on-going as of the date of this
Agreement and request that any such Person promptly return and destroy (and
confirm destruction of) all confidential information concerning the Company.
The Company will take the necessary steps to promptly inform, on the date of
this Agreement, the individuals or entities referred to in the preceding
sentence of this Section 6.9(f).

(g)Notice. Without limiting anything in this Section 6.9, the Company will
promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in
writing if (i) any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to the
Company (other than requests for information in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an Alternative
Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations with respect to
an Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company or any of its respective Representatives, indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of such inquiries, proposals or offers, and including in the
written version of such notice, an unredacted copy of any written (including
via electronic transmission) inquiries, proposals or offers (including (A) any
confidentiality and standstill agreement described in Section 6.9(a)(iii) and
(B) any materials related to financing with respect to the Alternative

Alternative Proposal may be redacted in a manner equivalent to Parent's Debt
Commitment Letters referred to in Section 4.6), in each case, including any
amendments or modifications thereto or (ii) any events or circumstances occur
that have caused, or would reasonably be expected to cause, an Intervening
Event, including any material changes in any such events or circumstances. The
Company will promptly (and, in any event, within 24 hours after any amendment
or modification of any such inquiry, proposal or offer or Alternative
Proposal) notify Parent orally and in writing of any amendments or
modifications thereto and furnish an unredacted copy of any such written
(including via electronic transmission) amendments or modifications. The
Company will not, and will cause its respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives not to, enter into any Contract that would prohibit the
Company from providing the information required to be provided to Parent
pursuant to this Section 6.9(g).

Section 6.10Control of the Other Party's Business. Nothing contained in this
Agreement will give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to control or

and its Subsidiaries' respective operations.

Section 6.11Subsidiary Compliance. Parent will cause the payment, performance
and discharge by Merger Sub of, and the compliance by Merger Sub with, all of

Merger Sub to approve this Agreement in its capacity as sole shareholder of
Merger Sub and deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by
written consent approving this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub. During the period from
the date of this Agreement through the Effective Time, Merger Sub will not,
and Parent will not permit Merger Sub to, engage in any activity of any nature
except as contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 6.12Financing.

(a)Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing which, together with cash on

other cash amounts payable pursuant to, or in connection with, the
Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and
enter into the Financing Agreements and (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable

to) provide (x) all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is
customary, necessary or advisable in connection with arranging, obtaining and
syndicating the Financing and any other financing or refinancing transactions
undertaken by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to the extent that information
relating to, or the participation by members of management of, the Company is
reasonably necessary in connection therewith and causing the conditions in the
Financing Agreements to be satisfied and (y) provide all information and
assistance that is customarily provided in financings comparable to the
proposed Financing or such other financing or refinancing transaction, as the
case may be, including using reasonable best efforts in (i) assisting with,
and designating one member of senior management of the Company to participate
in, the preparation of offering and syndication documents and materials,
including registration statements, prospectuses, private placement memoranda,
bank information memoranda, bank syndication material and packages, lender and
investor presentations, rating agency materials and presentations, and similar
documents and materials, in connection with the Financing, and providing reasonable and customary authorization letters to
the Financing Sources authorizing the distribution of information to
prospective lenders and containing customary information (all such documents
and materials, collectively, the "Offering Documents"), (ii) furnishing
promptly to Parent all Required Information as may be reasonably requested by
Parent to assist in the preparation of the Offering Documents (including
execution of customary authorization and management representation letters),

assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings and, if

the Company Subsidiaries or Affiliates required by applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the USA
PATRIOT Act, to the extent reasonably requested at least 10 Business Days
prior to the anticipated Closing, and (ix) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, reasonably requested by
Parent to permit the consummation of the Financing and to permit the proceeds
thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation immediately upon the
Effective Time, except that (A) nothing in this Section 6.12(b) will require
such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the
business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, (B) no
obligation of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under any certificate,
document, agreement or instrument (other than the authorization and
representation letters referred to above) will be effective until the
Effective Time and, none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be
required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other
liability (other than in connection with the authorization and representation
letters referred to above) in connection with the Financing prior to the
Effective Time and (C) none of the Company Board or board of directors (or
equivalent bodies) of any Company Subsidiary will be required to adopt or
enter into any resolutions or take similar action approving the Financing
(except that concurrently with the Closing the boards (or their equivalent
bodies) of Company Subsidiaries may adopt resolutions or take similar actions
that do not become effective until the Effective Time). Parent and Parent
Subsidiaries will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries and each of their respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, Representatives, successors and assigns from and against any and all
damages, fees, costs and expenses suffered or incurred by them other than
those liabilities, damages, fees, costs and expenses arising out of a material
misstatement in or failure to state a material fact pertinent to the
information provided by or on behalf of the Company pursuant to this Section
6.12(b), in connection with the arrangement of the Financing or the use of any Offering Documents. Upon reasonable request of the Company, the
Company and its outside legal counsel will be given reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Offering Documents, or any materials for rating
agencies, in each case, prepared after the date hereof, that include
information about the Company or any Company Subsidiary prepared in connection
with the Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use of the Company's
and the Company Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Financing in a form
and manner agreed with the Company; except that such logos are to be used
solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or
disparage the Company or any Company Subsidiary or the reputation or goodwill
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company will, upon request of
Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to periodically update any Required
Information (to the extent it is available) to be included in any Offering
Document to be used in connection with such Financing so that Parent may
ensure that any such Required Information does not contain any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein not misleading.

(c)The Company will file with the SEC all Company Reports on Form 10-K and
Form 10-Q on or prior to the date on which such Company Reports are required
to be filed under the Exchange Act, including any extensions with respect
thereto.

(d)Parent will promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in
connection with the cooperation of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
contemplated by Section 6.12(b).

(e)Each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obligations of
each of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement and the Transactions,
including the obligations of each of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the
Merger, will not be subject to, or conditioned on, receipt of financing.

Section 6.13Transaction Litigation. The Company will give Parent prompt notice
of any Action commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
against the Company or its directors, officers, managers, partners or
Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the Merger (collectively,
"Transaction Litigation"). The Company will consult with Parent regarding the
defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and will not compromise,
settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the
same, without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In connection with any
Transaction Litigation and the Parties' performance of their obligations under
this Section 6.13, the Parties will enter into a customary common interest or
joint defense agreement or implement such other techniques as reasonably
required to preserve any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal
privilege; except that the Company will not be required to provide information
if doing so, in the opinion of the Company's legal counsel, would cause the loss of any attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal
privilege; except that, if any information is withheld pursuant to the
foregoing exception, the Company will inform Parent as to the general nature
of what is being withheld and the Parties will use reasonable best efforts to
enable the Company to provide such information without causing the loss of any
attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege.

Section 6.14Publicity. The initial press release with respect to the execution
of this Agreement will be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon
by Parent and the Company. Following such initial press release, none of the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub will, and neither the Company nor Parent will
permit any of its Subsidiaries to, issue or cause the publication of any press
release or similar public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make any
public statement concerning, the Transactions without the prior consent (which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of Parent,
in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by the Company, or the
Company, in the case of a proposed announcement or statement by Parent or
Merger Sub; except that either Party may, without the prior consent of the
other Party (but after prior consultation with the other Party to the extent
practicable under the circumstances) issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement to the extent such Party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law or by the rules and
regulations of the NYSE. The restrictions set forth in this Section 6.14 will
not apply to any release or public statement (a) made or proposed to be made
by the Company in connection with an Alternative Proposal or a Superior
Proposal or any action taken pursuant thereto or (b) in connection with any
dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions;
except that the foregoing will not limit the ability of any Party hereto to
make internal announcements to their respective employees and other
shareholders that are not inconsistent in any material respects with the prior
public disclosures regarding the Transactions.

Section 6.15Takeover Laws. If any Takeover Law is or may become applicable to
the Transactions, the Company, including the Company Board, will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and will otherwise act to irrevocably eliminate the effects of such
Takeover Law on the Merger.

Effective Time (except that representations and warranties that by their terms
speak specifically as of the date of this Agreement or another date will be
true and correct as of such date), except that this condition will be deemed
satisfied unless all inaccuracies in such representations and warranties in
the aggregate constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect at the Closing Date
(ignoring solely for purposes of this proviso any reference to Company
Material Adverse Effect or other materiality qualifiers contained in such
representations and warranties). The representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Sections 3.2(a), 3.2(b), 3.2(c), 3.2(d) and 3.3(a) will

such representations and warranties), and the Company will have received a
certificate signed on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub by the Chief Executive

of any condition set forth in Section 7.1, Section 7.2, or Section 7.3, as the

primarily results in, such failure.

ARTICLE VIII

(ii)if any Order having the effect set forth in Section 7.1(c) is in effect

of a condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) or Section 7.2(b) and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured by the Company by the earlier of (x)
the Outside Date and (y) 30 days following receipt of written notice from

representations or warranties set forth in this Agreement (or if any such
representations or warranties fail to be true) or either Parent or Merger Sub
has failed to perform its respective covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, which breach or failure (A) would (if it occurred or was continuing
as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.3(b) and (B) is incapable of being cured, or is
not cured, by Parent by the earlier of (1) the Outside Date and (2) 30 days

material respects with Section 6.9; provided that (A) prior to, and as a
condition of, any termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
this Section 8.1(d)(ii), the Company will have paid the Company Termination
Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b) and (B) any termination notice under

(a)Generally. In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in
Section 8.1, written notice thereof will be given to the other Party or
Parties, specifying the provision of this Agreement pursuant to which such
termination is made, and this Agreement will become null and void (other than
the provisions of this Section 8.2 and the provisions in Article IX, all of
which will survive termination of this Agreement). Except as provided in
Section 8.2(b), upon termination pursuant to this Article VIII, there will be
no liability on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their
respective directors, managers, officers and Affiliates (whether or not the
terminating Party), except that, upon the termination of this Agreement,
nothing will be deemed to release any Party from any liability to any other
Party for any intentional breach by such Party of this Agreement prior to such
termination.

(b)Company Termination Fee.

(i)In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii), (B) by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i)
and the Company Shareholders Meeting was not held or completed prior to
termination at a time when this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant to
(1) Section 8.1(c)(i) (if the failure to hold or complete the Company
Shareholders Meeting was due to the Company's failure to perform any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement (but not if due to any breach or
failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement)) or (2) Section 8.1(c)(ii) or (C) by the Company
or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) at a time when this Agreement was
terminable by Parent pursuant to (1) Section 8.1(c)(i) (if the failure to
obtain the Company Shareholder Approval was due to the Company's failure to
perform any covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement (but not if due
to any breach or failure to be true of any of the representations or
warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement)) or (2) Section
8.1(c)(ii), then the Company will pay to Parent a termination fee of
$201,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") promptly (but in no event later
than two Business Days) after such termination, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

(ii)In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(ii), then the Company will pay Parent the Company Termination
Fee prior to, and as a condition of, such termination.

(iii)In the event that this Agreement is terminated (A) (1) by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(i), if due to the Company's failure to perform any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement (but not if due to any breach or
failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement), and prior to such termination an Alternative Proposal has been made to the Company or has otherwise been
publicly announced, or a Person will have publicly announced an intention to
make an Alternative Proposal, (2) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(b)(i) at a time when (x) this Agreement was terminable by Parent pursuant
to Section 8.1(c)(i), if due to the Company's failure to perform any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement (but not if due to any breach or
failure to be true of any of the representations or warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement) or (y) the Company Shareholder Approval was not
obtained due to the Company Shareholders Meeting not being held or completed,
and in each case prior to such termination an Alternative Proposal has been
made to the Company or has otherwise been publicly announced, or a Person will
have publicly announced an intention to make an Alternative Proposal, or (3)
by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii), and prior to the
date of the Company Shareholders Meeting an Alternative Proposal has been made
to the Company or has otherwise been publicly announced, or a Person will have
publicly announced an intention to make an Alternative Proposal, and (B)
within nine months after any such termination (1) the Company or any of its
Affiliates has entered into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (2) any
Alternative Proposal has been consummated, then the Company will pay the
Company Termination Fee to Parent upon the earlier of (x) the consummation of
such Alternative Proposal and (y) entry into such Alternative Acquisition
Agreement, by wire transfer of immediately available funds; except that the
Company Termination Fee payable pursuant to this Section 8.2(b)(iii) will be
reduced by the Expense Reimbursement, if any, actually paid to Parent pursuant
to Section 8.2(c). For purposes of this Section 8.2(b)(iii) (including for
purposes of the definition of Alternative Acquisition Agreement), references
to "10% or more" in the definition of Alternative Proposal will be deemed to
be references to "more than 50%."

(c)Expense Reimbursement. In the event that this Agreement is terminated, by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(iii) (but not to the extent
Section 8.2(b)(i)(C) is applicable), then the Company will pay to Parent its
and its Affiliates' reasonable out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred
in connection with their investigation, consideration, documentation,
diligence and negotiation of this Agreement and the Transactions (including
the Financing), including all fees and expenses of Parent's and its
Affiliates' Representatives (the "Expense Reimbursement"), by wire transfer of
immediately available funds; except that the Expense Reimbursement will not
exceed $5,000,000 and the Company will not be obligated to reimburse Parent
for any internal cost allocations or charges among its Affiliates. Provided
that the Company has not breached its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect, the Expense Reimbursement will be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent or Merger Sub against the Company for a termination of the
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1(b)(iii), other than the payment of
the Company Termination Fee to the extent it is or otherwise becomes payable
pursuant to Section 8.2(b). In the event the Expense Reimbursement is paid and
a Company Termination Fee is thereafter payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b),
the Company Termination Fee otherwise payable will be reduced by the amount of the Expense
Reimbursement.

(d)Collection Fees and Expenses. Each Party acknowledges that the agreements
contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the Transactions, and
that, without these agreements, no Party would enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due under this
Section 8.2, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences an Action
that results in an Order against the Company, the Company will pay to Parent
the costs and expenses (including attorney's fees and expenses) in connection
with such Action and will pay interest on the amount payable pursuant to such
Order, compounded quarterly, at the prime lending rate prevailing during such
period as published in The Wall Street Journal, calculated on a daily basis
from the date such amounts were required to be paid (but for such Action)
until the date of actual payment. In no event will the Company be obligated to
pay more than one Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.2.

(e)Sole and Exclusive Remedy. Provided that the Company has not wilfully
breached in any material respect its obligations under (i) Section 6.9 or (ii)
(A) Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(c) and (B) such breach results in a failure to hold
or complete the Company Shareholders Meeting or a failure to file or mail the
Proxy Statement, in the event that the Company Termination Fee is paid by the
Company to Parent in accordance with this Section 8.2, such payment will be
the sole and exclusive remedy at law of Parent and Merger Sub against the
Company for any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees,
expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and disbursements), judgments,
inquiries and fines suffered as a result of any breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement by the Company; except that
the foregoing will not impair the rights of Parent to obtain injunctive relief
pursuant to Section 9.12 prior to any termination of this Agreement. Solely
for purposes of this Section 8.2(e), a "wilful" breach will be deemed to have
occurred if the Company took or failed to take action with knowledge that such
action or inaction constituted a breach of such obligation.

All attachments to the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure
Letter are incorporated by reference into the Company Disclosure Letter and
the Parent Disclosure Letter, respectively, in which they are directly or
indirectly referenced. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the mere inclusion of an item therein as an exception to a

represents a material exception or material fact, event or circumstance or
that such item has had or would, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, as the case
may be.

(b)The Parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement will be construed as if drafted jointly
by the Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof will arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement and

extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument

insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition will not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties hereto and their

Section 9.12Specific Performance. The Parties hereto agree that immediate,
extensive and irreparable damage, for which monetary damages would not be an
adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties hereto do not
perform their obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties will be entitled, in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity, to an
injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof (including the obligation of the Parties hereto to
consummate the Merger and the obligation of Parent and Merger Sub to pay, and
the Company's shareholders' right to receive, the Merger Consideration payable
to them pursuant to the Merger, in each case in accordance with the terms and

proof of damages or otherwise, and that such explicit rights of specific
enforcement are an integral part of the Transactions and, without such rights,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement. Each of
the Parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or in
equity. The Parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement will not be required
to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order or

covenants and restrictions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
effect and will in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated.
