   | f.| _2015  Accounts Dispute Resolution_. If the Purchaser and the
Vendors' Representative  are unable to resolve any 2015 Accounts Dispute
within the 15-day period after the Vendors'  Representative's delivery of a
2015 Accounts Dispute Notice, the Vendors'  Representative and the Purchaser
shall jointly engage the Independent Expert as an arbitrator  to promptly
resolve any 2015 Accounts Disputes under the 2015 Accounts and the EBITDA 
figure thereto. In connection with the resolution of any 2015 Accounts
Dispute, the Independent  Expert shall have reasonable access during normal
business hours upon at least three  Business Days' advance notice to all
relevant portions of documents, records, work  papers, facilities and
financial and accounting personnel of the Company and the Gadea  Group to the
extent necessary to perform its function as arbitrator (but excluding Tax 
Returns of the Purchaser and its Affiliates other than the Company and its
Gadea's  Subsidiaries). The Independent Expert's function shall be to conform
the 2015 Accounts  to the requirements of this Clause 2.3(ii)(a). The
Independent Expert shall allow the  Purchaser and the Vendors' Representative
to present their respective positions  regarding the 2015 Accounts Dispute.
The Independent Expert may, at its discretion, conduct  a conference
concerning the 2015 Accounts Dispute, at which conference each of the
Purchaser  and the Vendors' Representative shall have the right to present
additional documents,  materials and other information and to have present
its advisors, counsel and accountants  and each of the Purchaser and the
Vendors' Representative agree that they will  deliver to the other party all
such documents, materials and other information at least  five Business Days
in advance of such conference. In connection with such process, there  shall
be no other hearings or any oral examinations, testimony, depositions,
discovery  or other similar proceedings. The Independent Expert shall
thereafter promptly render  its decision on the question in writing and
finalize the 2015 Accounts and the resultant  EBITDA. Such written
determination shall be final and binding for purposes of this Agreement. 
Upon the resolution of all 2015 Accounts Disputes, the 2015 Accounts shall be
revised  just for internal purposes to the effects of the 2015 Accounts
Dispute, to reflect the  resolution and the EBITDA amount set forth thereon
shall be treated as the final EBITDA  to be taken into consideration to the
effects of the WC Adjustment Difference. The fees  and expenses of the
Independent Expert for this purpose shall be allocated between (A)  the
Vendors and (B) the Purchaser, so that the Vendors' share of such fees and 
expenses (which shall be paid by the Vendors through the Vendors'
Representative  who shall have the right to recover from the other Vendors
the amount paid by the Vendors'  Representative on behalf of the other
Vendors) shall be equal to the product of (i) the  aggregate amount of such
fees and expenses, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator  of which is
the amount in dispute that is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by the
Vendors'  Representative (as determined by the Independent Expert), and the
denominator of which  is the total amount in dispute.

 _EXECUTION VERSION_

  



   | 2| The Purchaser  has identified a concern that the subsurface
(including the soil and water) at Gadea's  Manufacturing Site(s) may be
subject to contamination. The Vendors and the Purchaser  have agreed that
further investigations are necessary. Accordingly, as soon as reasonably 
possible (and within not more than 4 months following Closing, or such other
period as  may be mutually agreed between the Vendors' Representative and the
AMRI), the AMRI  shall arrange for a report to be prepared by AMRI's
Environmental Consultants ("AEC  Report") in order to determine, in respect
of Gadea's Manufacturing Sites,  the nature and extent of any such
contamination and provide professional recommendations  regarding proposed
remediation work. For this purpose, based on advice from AMRI's 
Environmental Consultants, borehole and any other reasonably necessary tests
may be conducted.  If the AEC Report recommends that no remediation is
necessary ("AEC No Remedy  Necessary Report"), then no further steps will be
taken. If the AEC Report  recommends that any remediation work is necessary
("AEC Remedy Necessary Report"),  then, following the receipt of the AEC
Report and its professional recommendation, AMRI  shall prepare a proposed
remediation plan. Before, concluding any final remediation plan,  the AMRI
shall as soon as reasonably possible following receipt of the AEC Report,
provide  a draft of the proposed remediation plan to include a budget for
such work ("Remediation  Plan") to the Vendors' Representative who shall,
within 3 weeks of receiving  the same, be entitled to ask for a meeting in
order to discuss such Remediation Plan  with AMRI's Environmental Consultants
and AMRI. Such meeting shall be convened  within 4 weeks. The Vendors'
Representative shall be entitled, at its sole cost  and expense to review
such Remediation Plan, and discuss the same with the Gadea Environmental 
Consultant, and such Gadea Environmental Consultant shall be entitled to
attend the meeting  requested by the Vendors' Representative to discuss the
Remediation Plan with AMRI  and/or the AMRI Environmental Consultant.
Following such consultation (if required),  or after 3 weeks following the
date of issuance of the Remediation Plan (if such consultation  is not
required), the AMRI shall present the final Remediation Plan ("Final 
Remediation Plan") to the Vendors' Representative. The Purchaser and  the
Vendors, through the Vendors' Representative, shall co-operate with each
other  to ensure the process described in this paragraph works efficiently
and effectively,  and that, in the case of the AEC Report being a AEC Remedy
Necessary Report, the Final  Remediation Plan is issued no later than 6
months after the date of issue of the AEC  Report. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 3| The Vendors'  Representative shall have 45 days after the date of
receipt of the Final Remediation  Plan ("FRP Dispute Period") to dispute any
recommendations in the  Final Remediation Plan as to the nature and extent of
(a) any contamination to the subsurface  at Gadea's Manufacturing Sites, and
(b) any necessary remediation work ("FRP  Dispute"). If the Vendors'
Representative does not give timely written  notice to the Purchaser of a FRP
Dispute ("FRP Dispute Notice") within  the FRP Dispute Period, the FRP shall
be treated as if it had been accepted and agreed  to by the Vendors, in the
form in which it was delivered. If the Vendors' Representative  has a FRP
Dispute, the Vendors' Representative shall deliver to the Purchaser a  FRP
Dispute Notice within the FRP Dispute Period, setting forth, in reasonable
detail,  the elements and issues with which it disagrees and the reasons
therefor. During the  15 day period following the delivery of the FRP Dispute
Notice, the Purchaser and the  Vendors' Representative shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve the  FRP Dispute and agree in writing upon the
final content of the disputed FRP. If the Purchaser  and the Vendors'
Representative agree as to the content of the FRP, the FRP as  so agreed
shall be final and binding for the purposes of this Clause.

   | 4| If the  Purchaser and the Vendors' Representative are unable to
resolve any FRP Dispute  within the 15 day period after the Vendors'
Representative's delivery of  a FRP Dispute Notice, the Vendors'
Representative and the Purchaser shall jointly  engage INERCO ("Independent
Environmental Expert") as an arbitrator  to promptly resolve any FRP
Disputes. In connection with the resolution of any FRP Dispute,  the
Independent Environmental Expert shall be given reasonable access to the
relevant  Gadea's Manufacturing Site(s) and to the investigations conducted
by AMRI's  Environmental Consultants. The Independent Environmental Expert
shall be entitled to  require the conduct of any further borehole or other
tests as he or she may require.  The Independent Environmental Expert's
function ("Independent Environmental  Expert's Function") shall be (a) to
confirm (or otherwise) the conclusions  of the FRP as issued by AMRI; and (b)
make such recommendations as he or she sees fit  for any necessary
remediation work, based on standard tests and analytical results according 
to RD 9/2005, and given the nature of Gadea's Manufacturing Site, the
severity  of any contamination or non-compliance found at the site and the
status of the Company  as a Spanish company with a publicly traded US public
company as its ultimate parent,  subject to the requirements of US law (for
the avoidance of doubt, the provisions of  this clause are intended to ensure
that any remediation works required to deal with contamination  are designed
and implemented in a way which will achieve compliance with the relevant 
requirements of the law in Spain or with the requirements which are standardly
followed  in similar works approved by the administration in Spain). The
Independent Environmental  Expert shall allow the Purchaser and the Vendors'
Representative to present their  respective positions regarding the FRP
Dispute. The Independent Environmental Expert  may, at his or her discretion,
conduct a conference concerning the FRP Dispute, at which  conference each of
the Purchaser and the Vendors' Representative shall have the  right to
present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present  its advisors, counsel and environmental consultants, and each of the
Purchaser and the  Vendors' Representative agree that they will deliver to
the other party all such  documents, materials and other information at least
five Business Days in advance of  such conference. In connection with such
process, there shall be no other hearings or  any oral examinations,
testimony, depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings.  The
Independent Environmental Expert shall thereafter promptly render his or her
written  decision on the question in relation to the Independent
Environmental Expert's  Function. Such written decision shall be final and
binding for the purposes of this Clause  and shall be deemed an AEC Remedy
Necessary Report for the purpose of this Clause. The  fees and expenses of
the Independent Environmental Expert shall be shared between the  Vendors and
the Purchaser on a 50:50 basis and the Vendors' share shall be paid  from the
Escrow Account. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein
and  regardless of the written decision delivered by the Independent
Environmental Expert,  AMRI shall not be limited or restricted in any manner
from investigating, pursuing and/or  implementing any actions or remediation
with respect to environmental and other matters  at any Gadea Manufacturing
Site(s); to the extent that any such actions or remediation  are additional
to any Remediation Work, the Vendors will not assume any payment or cost.

   | 5| Except  as set forth above, the costs of professional fees
incurred in preparing the FRP and  the cost of the Remediation Work shall be
shared equally between the Vendors and the  Purchaser on an equal, Euro for
Euro basis provided that, except in the case of fraud,  wilful concealment or
intentional misrepresentation, the Vendors' share of the  Remediation Work
shall not under any circumstances exceed Euros 3,632,401.02 (the
Environmental  Escrow Amount) which amount has been included as an additional
amount in the Escrow Amount  for the purposes only as described in this
Clause (and not for any other purposes). Any  claim for payment by the
Vendors under this Clause 5.1.6 shall be satisfied by a withdrawal  from the
Escrow Account against this amount, as set out in sub-clause 6 below, and
not  in any other way, unless otherwise set forth herein. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 6| In the  case of the AEC Report being an AEC No Remedy Necessary
Report, within fifteen days of  receipt of such report, subject to deducting
50% of the costs of professional fees incurred  in preparing such report, the
Purchaser will execute any forms necessary to allow all  the remainder of the
Environmental Escrow Amount to be released from the Escrow Account  to the
Vendors in accordance with their Pro Rata Portions and the terms of the
Escrow  Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7| In the  case of the AEC Report being an AEC Remedy Necessary
Report, within fifteen days of receipt  of such report, subject to deducting
50% of (a) the costs of professional fees incurred  in preparing such report
and (b) the value of the FRP Budget, the Purchaser will execute  any forms
necessary to allow all the remainder of the Environmental Escrow Amount to 
be released from the Escrow Account to the Vendors in accordance with their
Pro Rata  Portions and the terms of the Escrow Agreement. For the avoidance
of doubt, if the deductions  mentioned in (a) and (b) of this paragraph
exceed the Environmental Escrow Amount, then  no payment out of the Escrow
Account under this paragraph shall apply. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 8| In order  to recover the Vendors' share of any Remediation Works,
until expiry of the period  established in sub-clause 9 below, once per
quarter, within 60 days following the end  of each quarter, AMRI will provide
the Vendors' Representative with an invoice  detailing costs spent in the
prior quarter under any part of the Final Remediation Plan,  with sufficient
detail that the Vendor can review the major activities and categories  of
spending in such quarter ("Quarterly Report"). Within fifteen days  of
receipt of such report, the Vendors' Representative will execute any forms
necessary  to allow for payment to AMRI or the Purchaser from the Escrow
Account for 50% of the  fees as set forth in the Quarterly Report.

Vendors' obligations shall be subject to the following quantitative
limitations:

  



   | a)| _Threshold _ 
---|---|--- 
  

 _ _

  

Vendors shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser until the
accumulated amount of Damages exceeds five hundred thousand

 _EXECUTION VERSION_

  



   | 3.| the indemnification  obligations of the Vendors shall have no
limit on amount, and therefore (A) the Liability  Cap established in the
first paragraph of Clause 5.2.1(b) above and (B) the Overall Threshold

from the Vendors the indemnification for Damages set out in this Clause with
the following time limits:

  



   | ¡| Fundamental  Representations and Warranties and/or those
Representations and Warranties of a social  security nature, until the
statute of limitations (as it may be interpreted from time  to time by
Spanish Courts) on said obligations has run according to applicable
legislation  in each case. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | ¡| Those  arising from the lack of accuracy of the Individual
Representations and Warranties shall  remain unlimited.

The Vendors shall not be obliged to indemnify the Purchaser for any claims
filed by the Purchaser once the periods mentioned in this Clause 5.2.2 have
expired.

  



   | 5.2.3| Qualitative  limits on liability 
---|---|--- 
  



  

The Vendors shall not be liable to the Purchaser:

acts taking place after the  Signing Date, unless they arise from situations,
facts or omissions prior to the Signing  Date;

Any indemnification that may be owed by the Vendors to the Purchaser shall be
calculated as follows:

  



   | (a)| The  indemnification for the Damages suffered by the Company or
the Purchaser shall be equal  to the amount of the Damages suffered by the
Company or Purchaser. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (b)| In  calculating the indemnification payable by the Vendors, an
amount relating to the Damage  equal to (i) the corporate income tax or other
tax  deductions effectively deducted against the tax liability payable, 
minus (ii) the corporate income tax or other kind of taxes to be paid by the
Purchaser,  both as a consequence of the indemnification received; shall be
deducted therefrom 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Further to the above, it shall be deducted any tax credit related to double
taxation as provided for in article 30.6 of Corporate Income Tax Law approved
by Legislative Royal Decree 4/2004, dated March 5, and transitional provision
Twenty-Three of Corporate Income Tax Law 27/2014, dated November 27, arising
from dividend distributions carried out by Crystal Pharma during the 2015
fiscal year and before the Signing Date, provided that (i) the company is
able to prove that an amount equal to the dividends received has been
included in the tax base and has been taxed in respect of the gain obtained by

terms of the Escrow Agreement. Finally, any Damages incurred as a result of
the Tax Specific Indemnity Events shall be initially satisfied out of the
portion of the Tax Specific Indemnity Escrow Amount then held in escrow

   | 7.2| Third-party  claims 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event of any claim, requirement, inspection or action by a third party
that may give rise to Damage (hereinafter, "Third-Party Claim") for which a
Party ("Respondent Party") must indemnify the other Party ("Claimant Party"),
the following procedure shall be followed:

  



   | (i)| Where  the Claimant Party learns of a third-party claim that may
give rise to a Damage, it shall  notify the Respondent Party of such claim
(hereinafter, the "Third-Party Damage  Notice"), no later than ten (10)
Business Days from such time, and in all cases  before a third of the
procedural or legally-established time to reply to said potential  Third-
Party Claims has elapsed, should such time limit legally exist. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| The  Third-Party Damage Notice shall include: (i) a copy of the
document containing the Third-Party  Claim or the document through which the
inspection or revision on which it is based is  initiated, as the case may
be; (ii) the amount claimed with a breakdown of the various  elements of
which it is comprised (if this can be estimated); (iii) a reference to the 
Vendors' Representation and Warranty or AMRI's Representation and Warranty, 
as applicable, pursuant to which the Damage must be indemnified, where
applicable; and  (iv) any other information that the Claimant Party deems
appropriate. The Third-Party  Damage Notice shall be accompanied by any
reasonable and pertinent supporting documentation  as it may have on the
third-party claim to enable the Respondent Party to: (a) assess  the
advisability of settling or reaching an agreement on the claim; or (b) prepare
a  defense against the claim, if the Respondent Party consider the claim to
be inappropriate  and can assume the defense of the claim pursuant to the
provisions of Clause 7.2.(iii). 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| Within  twenty (20) Business Days following receipt of the
Third-Party Damage Notice or, if there  is a shorter procedural or legal term
in which to reply to the Third-Party Claim, before  two-thirds of that term
have elapsed, the Respondent Party shall notify (in case of the  Respondent
Party shall be done by the Vendors' Representative) the Claimant Party:  (i)
if he refuses to accept the liability arising from the Third-Party Claim,
where applicable,  or (ii) if he accepts such liability in whole or in part.
If the Respondent Party fails  to reply, it shall be deemed that the
liability arising from the Third-Party Claim has  been rejected outright by
the Respondent Party. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iv)| In  the event that the Respondent Party does not reply within
the agreed time period set  forth in Clause 7.2.(iii) or in the case he
expressly refuse to take on the right of  defense against the Third-Party
Claim within the agreed time period set forth in Clause  7.2.(iii), the
Claimant Party may, acting in good faith, take any such defensive action  as
it may deem appropriate, including a settlement in or out of court or an
agreement.  In all cases, the Respondent Party shall be entitled to be kept
informed of the progress  of the Third-Party Claim in question and shall have
reasonable access to all the information  and documentation regarding the
same.

 _EXECUTION VERSION_

  



   | (v)| In the  case referred to in Clause 7.2.(iii).(i) and
7.2.(iii).(ii) above provided that the Respondent  Party replies within the
agreed time period set forth in Clause 7.2.(iiiI, the Respondent  Party shall
indicate in their reply whether they take on the right of defense against 
the Third-Party Claim. In such case, the Respondent Party shall be entitled to
take any  such defensive action as they may deem appropriate against the
Third-Party Claim and  they shall exclusively bear the expenses incurred in
the defense of the Third-Party Claim,  as well as any expenses in relation to
the provision or maintenance of payments into  court, security deposits or
guarantees that may have to be granted as a result of said  defense in any
proceeding. However, the Respondent Party shall be entitled to recover  such
expenses from the Company, the Subsidiaries or the Purchaser in the event that
the  result of the dispute is favorable to any of the latter, in which case
such expenses  shall be paid within twenty (20) Business Days of the date on
which the Third- Party  Claim is resolved and becomes final. In all cases,
the Claimant Party, alone or through  the advisors it freely designates,
shall have reasonable access to the information and  documentation regarding
the claim in question. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vi)| Claimant  Party shall supply the information necessary for the
Respondent Party to take the defensive  action to which this Clause 7.2
refers and shall provide the appropriate cooperation,  including granting
powers of attorney or other instruments of representation to the lawyers  and
court procedural representatives freely designated by the Respondent Party. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (vii)| In  the event that the Respondent Party assume the defense,
the Respondent Party or its advisors  may only enter into a settlement,
agreement or in any other manner reach a settlement  in or out of court with
the competent public authorities or with any third party, without  the
express, prior and written consent of the Purchaser where, simultaneously on
entering  into the settlement or agreement, they make available to the
Claimant Party, the Company  or the Gadea's Subsidiaries, as the case may be,
all the funds that they must pay  the third party pursuant to the settlement
or agreement. Said provision shall not be  necessary where, following the
posting of a bond by the Respondent sufficient to cover  the liability in
question, the bond has been enforced. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (viii)| In  the event that the Respondent Party choose not to assume
the right to take defensive  action against the Third-Party Claim (in which
case the Claimant Party may, acting in  good faith, take the defensive action
it deems appropriate, and the Respondent Party  must give their consent to
any settlement in or out of court), alone or through the advisors  they
freely choose, they shall be entitled to be informed of the progress of the
claim  in question and shall have reasonable access to all the information
and documentation  regarding the same.

   | (ix)| In  the event that Third-Party Damage Notice was delivered by
the Claimant Party to the Respondent  Party without due prior notice set
forth in the Clause 7.2.(i), thereby preventing the  Respondent Party
reasonably taking charge of the defense against the Third-Party Claim,  the
Respondent Party shall be entitled to be indemnified by the Claimant Party for
all  Damages that said breach caused to the Respondent Party. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.3| Determination  of the obligation to provide indemnification 
---|---|--- 
  



  

Pursuant to Clauses 5 and 6 of this Agreement, the indemnification
obligations shall be governed by the following provisions:

  



   | (i)| With  respect to Direct Claims envisaged in Clause 7.1 of this
Clause, the payment obligation  arising from the indemnification undertakings
contained hereunder shall be enforceable  against the Respondent Party where
there is (i) an agreement between the Claimant Party  and the Respondent
Party regarding the suitability and amount to be indemnified, or (ii)  from
the existence of a final arbitral award pursuant to Clause 14,  and in both
cases provided that the debt resulting therefrom  is net, due and payable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| With  respect to Third-Party Claims envisaged in Clause 7.2,
the payment obligation arising  from the indemnification undertakings
hereunder shall be claimable once there is (i)  an agreement between the
Claimant Party and the Respondent Party regarding the suitability  and amount
to be indemnified, or (ii) a final arbitral award pursuant to Clause 14; as 
well as, (iii) in the event that the Respondent Party accept that the Third-
Party Claim  may give rise to Damages and fully assume the relevant
liability, said payment obligation  shall also be enforceable once there is a
final judgment, decision, award or administrative  act in relation to the
Third-Party Claim, and  in all cases provided that the debt resulting
therefrom is net, due and payable. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | 7.4| Claims  arising from the Individual Representations and
Warranties 
---|---|--- 
  



  

In the event of Direct Claims or Third-Party Claims arising from the
inaccuracy, inauthenticity, incorrectness and/or a breach of the Individual
Representations and Warranties, the provisions of the preceding sections of
Clause 7 shall be applied _mutatis mutandis_ , except for matters pertaining
to the Vendors' Representative and Vendors overall, which shall be deemed
to refer to the Vendors against which the claim is aimed.

Agreement shall otherwise continue to be valid and not affected as a result,
