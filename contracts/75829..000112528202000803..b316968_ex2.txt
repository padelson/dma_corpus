supporting information as may be reasonably requested by USF. The Purchase
Price Adjustment shall be calculated using the same foreign exchange rates as
were used in the preparation of the Balance Sheet. If USF shall have any
objections to Buyer\'s calculation of the Purchase Price Adjustment, USF
shall so notify Buyer no later than ten (10) Business Days after delivery of
the schedule, and Buyer and USF shall endeavor in good faith for a period not
to exceed 10 Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to
resolve their differences (the "Differences"). If at the end of the 10
Business Day period the parties are unable to resolve any of their
Differences, USF and Buyer shall submit the calculation and resolution of
such Differences to an independent public accounting firm of recognized
national standing in the United States that they agree on in writing. If
Buyer and USF have not agreed on an independent public accounting firm by the
end of the 10 Business Day period referred to above, such firm shall be
selected by lot from those independent public accounting firms of recognized
national standing in the United States that are willing to act and, if there
are no such independent public accounting firms, from the willing independent
public accounting firms of recognized regional standing in one or more
regions of the United States in which a Member has offices (the
independent public accounting firm selected pursuant to the foregoing
procedures, the "Accounting Mediator"). The Accounting Mediator shall be
instructed to resolve such Differences and such resolution shall be (i) set
forth in writing and signed by the Accounting Mediator, (ii) delivered to
Buyer and USF as soon as practicable after the Differences are submitted to
the Accounting Mediator but not later than the 30th day after such
submission, (iii) made in accordance with this Agreement and (iv) conclusive
and binding on the Parties on the date of delivery of such resolution. The
Accounting Mediator shall only be authorized on any one issue to decide in
favor of and choose the position of either of the Parties or to decide upon a
compromise position between the ranges presented by the Parties to such
Accounting Mediator. The Accounting Mediator shall base its decision solely
upon the presentations of the Parties to the Accounting Mediator at a hearing
held before the Accounting Mediator and upon any materials made available by
either Party and not upon independent review. If the foregoing procedure does
not result in the selection of an Accounting Mediator or if the Accounting
Mediator does not or is unwilling to resolve all of the Differences on or
before the expiration of 30 days from the date of submission of
the Differences, either Party shall be entitled for a period of 10
additional Business Days to apply for arbitration of the unresolved
Differences to the American Arbitration Association ("AAA Arbitration") and,
if a Party so applies, the Parties shall submit the matter to AAA Arbitration
in the City of Wilmington, Delaware, which shall be binding upon the Parties.
If neither Party shall apply for AAA Arbitration of the unresolved
Differences, the Purchase Price Adjustment shall be deemed to be the amount
provided by Buyer to USF pursuant to this subsection, adjusted to reflect
those Differences that were theretofore resolved, if any, by the Parties or,
if applicable, by the Accounting Mediator. The fees and expenses of the
Accounting Mediator or AAA Arbitration, or both, if any, shall be borne
equally by Buyer and USF.    10    (b Amount. If the Purchase Price
Adjustment as finally determined (whether by agreement of the Parties, lapse
of time or resolution of the Differences) is positive, Buyer shall pay to USF
the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment plus interest from the Closing
Date to the date of payment, inclusive of each such date, at the Reference
Rate. If the Purchase Price Adjustment as so finally determined is negative,
USF shall pay to Buyer the amount of the Purchase Price Adjustment plus
interest for the period and at the rate described in the preceding
sentence.   (c) Payment. Payment of the Purchase Price Adjustment plus
accrued interest shall be made by Buyer or USF, as the case may be, to the
other Party in United States Dollars by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the wire transfer address of such other Party on the 5th
Business Day following the date on which the procedures for resolution of the
Differences in this Section 2.4 have been completed (the "Final Payment
Date"), which wire transfer address shall be designated by Buyer or USF, as
the case may be, by notice to the other on or before the 2nd Business Day
prior to the Final Payment Date.   2.5 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall
have been terminated and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been
abandoned pursuant to Section 7.3, and subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII, the closing of the USFCA
Share Transfer (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 A.M. at the offices
of Sutherland Asbill and Brennan LLP, 999 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia
30309, as soon as practicable, but in any event within three (3) Business
Days after the last of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof is
satisfied or waived, other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions, or at such other date, time or place as the Parties shall
agree in writing. Such date is herein referred to as the "Closing Date."  
2.6 Payment. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement,
at the Closing, Buyer shall pay the Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by USF.   ARTICLE

that all representations and warranties of USF in this Article III are made
only with respect to the period from and after the date which is the later of

predecessor of the Group), (ii) to the extent any such representation or
warranty relates to any Member acquired by USF or any of its Affiliates after
December 9, 1997, the date upon which such Member was acquired by USF or any
of its Affiliates, and (iii) any date specifically referred to in such
representation or warranty (any such period, the "Operative Period")):

good standing (in those jurisdictions in which the concept of good standing
is applicable) in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of the activities conducted by
it make such qualification and good standing necessary, except where the
failure to be so qualified or in good standing could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Schedule 3.1 sets forth a list of
all jurisdictions where the character of the properties owned, operated or
leased by a U.S. Member or the nature of the activities conducted by such

of general application relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to
general equity principles. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and

validly authorized by all necessary corporate proceedings on the part of USF
and by the other Members of the Group if and to the extent required by Law or
Governing Documents.   3.3 Shares; Capitalization.    (a) Members. Other

any other binding commitment or obligation which remains enforceable to issue
or sell any shares of its capital stock, or any securities or obligations

granted to any Person any right which remains enforceable to subscribe for or
acquire from it any shares of its capital stock, and no such securities,

convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock, or has
granted to any Person any right which remains enforceable to subscribe for or
acquire from it any shares of its capital stock, and no such securities,
obligations or rights are outstanding.   (c) Transfer of Title. Upon
delivery of the USFCA Shares hereunder, Buyer will acquire title thereto,
free and clear of any and all Encumbrances except those arising under
federal, state or foreign securities Laws.   3.4 No Violation of Laws or
Agreements; Consents.   (a) No Violation of Laws or Agreements. Except as

forth on Schedule 3.13(a) is an accurate and complete list of all USF
Employee Benefit Plans, all Vivendi Employee Benefit Plans and all Foreign
Member Retirement Plans.   (b) Status of Plans.   (i) Each USF Employee
Benefit Plan (including any related trust) complies in form and has been
maintained and operated in accordance with the requirements of all applicable
Laws, including ERISA and the Code, and each USF Employee Benefit Plan (in
each case, including any related trust) has been maintained and operated in
substantial compliance with its terms. Except as set forth on Schedule
3.13(b), no complete or partial termination (described in Section 411(d)(3)
of the Code) of any USF Employee Benefit Plan has occurred or is expected to
occur. No USF Employee Benefit Plan is a plan described in Section 4063(a) of
ERISA.   (ii) Except as disclosed on Schedule 3.13(b), the Vivendi Employee
Benefit Plans are the only plans maintained by Vivendi Environnement S.A. or
Vivendi Universal S.A. which benefit employees of the Members and none of
such plans is subject to ERISA. Except for payroll tax obligations which
may arise upon exercise of outstanding stock options granted under Vivendi
Employee Benefit Plans, none of the Members has any obligations in respect
of, or any unfunded liabilities pursuant to, any Vivendi Employee Benefit
Plan.   (iii) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(b), each of the Foreign
Member Retirement Plans and all related trusts, insurance contracts and funds
have been created, maintained, funded and administered in all respects
in material compliance with all applicable Laws, including Tax Laws
regarding reserves, and the governing document, trust agreement, insurance
policy or other writing creating the same or applicable thereto.   (c)
Liabilities.    (i) No USF Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV
of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code.   (ii) Each USF Employee Benefit Plan
which is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1)
of the Code or Section 607(1) of ERISA) has been administered and operated in
substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle
B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code ("COBRA"), and no Member
is subject to any liability, including additional contributions, fines,
taxes, penalties or loss of tax deduction as a result of the administration
and operation of any such USF Employee Benefit Plan. No USF Employee Benefit
Plan which is such a group health plan is a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement," within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. Each USF Employee
Benefit Plan that is intended to meet the requirements of Section 125 of the
Code meets such requirements in all material respects, and each program of
benefits for which employee contributions are provided pursuant to elections
under any USF Employee Benefit Plan meets the requirements of the Code
applicable thereto.    21    (iii) No USF Employee Benefit Plan (whether
qualified or non-qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code) provides for
post-employment or retiree health, life insurance and/or other welfare
benefits, and no Member has any obligation under any USF Employee Benefit
Plan to provide any such benefits to any retired or former employees or
active employees following such employees\' retirement or termination of
service except as required by COBRA or any similar state law. No Member has
any unfunded liabilities pursuant to any USF Employee Benefit Plan that is
not intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code.   (iv) No
Member has incurred any liability or civil penalty under Section 409, 502(i)
or 502(l) of ERISA or liability for any tax or excise tax arising under
Chapter 43 or Section 6652 of the Code with respect to any USF Employee
Benefit Plan and no event has occurred and no condition or
circumstance exists that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any
such liability with respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan.   (v) There
are no actions, suits or claims pending or, to USF\'s Knowledge, threatened
against or with respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan or the assets of any
such plan (other than routine claims for benefits and appeals of denied
routine claims). No civil or criminal action brought pursuant to the
provisions of Title I, Subtitle B, Part 5 of ERISA is pending or, to USF\'s
Knowledge, threatened against any Member or, to USF\'s Knowledge,
any fiduciary of any USF Employee Benefit Plan with respect to any USF
Employee Benefit Plan. USF has not received any written notice that any USF
Employee Benefit Plan or any fiduciary thereof is presently the direct or
indirect subject of an audit, investigation or examination by any
governmental or quasi-governmental agency.   (vi) Except as shown on
Schedule 3.13(c), no Member has any liabilities (actual or contingent) with
respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan.   (d) Contributions. Except as
set forth on Schedule 3.13(d), each Member has made full and timely payment
of all amounts required to be paid by it as contributions or premiums to any
USF Employee Benefit Plan.   (e) Tax Qualification. Each USF Employee
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, as
currently in effect, is the subject of a favorable determination letter
issued by the IRS and the remedial amendment period described in Section
401(b) of the Code applicable to any amendment of any such USF Employee
Benefit Plan adopted after the date of such letter has not expired. Each
trust established in connection with any USF Employee Benefit Plan which is
intended to be exempt from federal income taxation under Section 501(a) of
the Code, as currently in effect, is the subject of a favorable determination
letter issued by the IRS and the remedial amendment period described in
Section 401(b) of the Code applicable to any amendment of any such USF
Employee Benefit Plan adopted after the date of such letter has not expired.
Since the date of each most recent determination letter referred to in this
paragraph (e), no event has occurred and no condition or circumstance exists
that has resulted or is reasonably likely to result in the revocation of any
such determination letter or that is reasonably likely to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such USF Employee Benefit Plan or the exempt
status of any such trust.    22     (f) Transactions. No Member nor any
of the directors, officers or employees of any Member or, to USF\'s
Knowledge, other Persons who participate in the operation of any USF Employee
Benefit Plan or related trust or funding vehicle, has engaged in any
transaction with respect to any USF Employee Benefit Plan, or breached any
applicable fiduciary responsibilities or obligations under Title I of ERISA
that would subject any of them to a tax, penalty or liability for prohibited
transactions or breach of any obligations under ERISA or the Code or would
result in any claim being made under, by or on behalf of any such
USF Employee Benefit Plan by any party with standing to make such claim.

its counsel true and complete copies of the United States Filter Corporation

suffered an "employment loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) during the past
six months.   (i) Agreements and Plans. Except as described in Schedule
3.13(a) or Schedule 3.13(i), no Member is, with respect to the employees of

Corporation under Section 302(c)(11), Section 4062, Section 4063, Section
4064, Section 4069 of ERISA with respect to any defined benefit pension plan
that is subject to Part 3 of Title I of ERISA, Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code. No Member has any liability (actual or contingent) under
Section 4980B(e) of the Code with respect to any "group health plan," as

ACTIONS PRIOR TO CLOSING DATE    28    The Parties covenant and agree to
take the following actions between the date hereof and the Closing Date:  
5.1 Access to Group Information.   (a) Access by Buyer. USF shall permit the
officers, employees and authorized representatives of Buyer (including
investment bankers, independent public accountants and attorneys) to have
reasonable access during normal business hours, upon reasonable advance
notice to the offices, properties and senior managers of the Group, and the
business and financial records of the Group (to the extent that they are not
trade secrets or otherwise competitively sensitive and, in the case of the
Joint Venture Entities, to the extent that USF or the Members have a right of
access), to the extent Buyer shall reasonably deem necessary or desirable in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and shall furnish to
Buyer or its authorized representatives such additional information
concerning the Group as shall be reasonably requested; provided, however,
that:   (i) USF shall not be required to violate any obligation
of confidentiality to which it or any Member is subject in discharging
its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.1; provided, however, that USF
shall not have the right, by virtue of this paragraph or otherwise, to
withhold any significant information relating to customers, suppliers or
regulatory authorities and, if USF is withholding any information based on an
obligation of confidentiality, USF shall so advise Buyer specifically of that
fact in each instance and shall use its commercially reasonable good faith
efforts to obtain a waiver from the party to whom the obligation of
confidentiality is owed to allow disclosure to Buyer of such information as
is provided for in Section 5.1(a); and   (ii) Such investigation shall be
conducted in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
operations of USF or any of its Subsidiaries.   (b) Notice of Breach. If in
the course of any investigation, Buyer discovers any breach of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement, or any circumstance
or condition that upon Closing would constitute a breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant, Buyer covenants that it will promptly inform USF in
writing of the nature of such breach.   5.2 Notifications. Each Party shall
promptly notify the other Party of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation that shall be instituted or threatened against such Party to
restrain, prohibit or otherwise challenge the legality of any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall promptly notify the other of
any action, suit, proceeding or investigation that may be threatened or
asserted in writing, brought or commenced against any Member, USF or Buyer,
as the case may be, that would have been listed in Schedule 3.9 or disclosed
under Section 4.4 as the case may be, if such action, suit, proceeding or
investigation had arisen prior to the date hereof.   5.3 Consents of Third
Parties. Each Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to secure,
before the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
other Party, any consent, approval or waiver required to be obtained from any
Person with respect to any Contract to which a Member is a party and which
the Parties have identified on Schedule 5.3 as those for which the failure to
obtain such consent, approval or waiver would have a Material Adverse Effect.
If such consent, approval or waiver cannot be obtained, USF shall cooperate
in any commercially reasonable arrangement designed to obtain for the Buyer
the material benefits, privileges and obligations of the applicable Contract;
provided, however, that no Party shall have any obligation to offer or pay
any consideration in order to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver. In
addition, if and to the extent (and in the manner) required by French law,
USF shall give notice of the change in control which will result upon the
Closing hereunder to any Workers\' Councils having jurisdiction over
any Member which is incorporated in France or by reason of its operations in
France is subject to the jurisdiction of any such Workers\' Council or
Councils.    29    5.4 Filings Under the HSR Act and Laws of Foreign
Jurisdictions.   (a) General. USF and Buyer acknowledge that the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement require filings with the FTC and
the Antitrust Division under the HSR Act and with certain Foreign
Jurisdictions under applicable foreign Laws as set forth on Schedule 5.4

each use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and to cooperate with each
other in order to obtain all consents, waivers, approvals, authorizations or
orders and to make all filings (including, without limitation, the filings
under the HSR Act and other Antitrust Laws and all other filings with United
States and non-United States Governmental Bodies) lawfully required to be
obtained from or filed with all applicable Governmental Bodies in connection
with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by USF and
Buyer and the consummation by them of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Each Party shall (i) file or cause to be filed, as promptly as practicable
but in no event later than the fifth Business Day after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, with the FTC and the Antitrust Division, all
reports and other documents required to be filed by such Party under the HSR
Act concerning the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) promptly comply
with or cause to be complied with any requests by the FTC and the Antitrust
Division for additional information concerning such transactions, in each
case so that the waiting period applicable to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby shall expire as soon as practicable after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement. USF and Buyer shall each
furnish to the other Party all information about such Party or its Affiliates
required to be included in any application or other filing to be made by such
other Party pursuant to the rules and regulations of any United States or
non-United States Governmental Body in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the agreements of the Parties contained in this Section 5.4,
each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve such objections
if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Body or other Person with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law. In
connection with the foregoing, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each Party shall cooperate in
all respects with the other and use its respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.    30    5.5 Operations Prior to Closing

acquire any securities of any Member; (C) adopt a plan of complete or partial
liquidation or resolutions providing for or authorizing a liquidation or
dissolution of any Member; or (D) declare or pay any dividend or distribution
with respect to the capital stock of any Member, other than dividends or
distributions to other Members and dividends or distributions necessary or
appropriate to eliminate intercompany balances among the Members or between
any of the Members and USF or any Affiliate, as indicated on Schedule
2.3;   (vii) not take any action to change accounting policies
or procedures (including procedures with respect to revenue recognition,
payments of accounts payable and collection of accounts receivable) except as
required by a change in GAAP occurring after the date hereof;    31   
(viii) not pay, discharge or satisfy any claims or liabilities (absolute,
accrued, asserted or unasserted, contingent or otherwise) of the Group in
excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate, other than the payment, discharge or
satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business and consistent
with past practices; and   (ix) not expend or agree to make capital
expenditures in excess of $2,000,000 per month.   (b) No Agreements.
Neither USF nor any Member shall enter into any agreement to do any of the
actions prohibited by Sections 5.5(a)(i) through 5.5(a)(ix).   5.6
Negotiations. Until the Closing or until this Agreement is terminated, USF
shall not, and USF shall cause each of the Members not to, solicit or enter
into any discussions or negotiations with, or furnish or cause to be
furnished any information concerning the Business to, any Person (other than
Buyer and its employees and agents) in connection with any
proposed acquisition of the Business by any Person other than Buyer.   5.7
Guaranty and Surety Obligations. Schedule 5.7 sets forth a list of all
guaranties, letters of credit and surety bonds outstanding as of the date
of this Agreement issued for the benefit of any Member under which USF or any
of its Affiliates (other than the Members) may bear the ultimate
responsibility to make payments. Such Schedule will be supplemented as
required from time to time prior to the Closing Date if and as required in
the ordinary course of business of the Group. Buyer shall, on or prior to the
Closing Date, obtain at its own cost and expense the release of any and all
such surety bonds, guaranties or letters of credit which are listed on
Schedule 5.7 at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date and
shall, as soon as practicable after the Closing Date, obtain at its own cost
and expense the release of any and all such surety bonds, guaranties or
letters of credits added to Schedule 5.7 less than ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date.   5.8 Alternative Structures. USF agrees to
consider in good faith one or more alternative structures under which Buyer
(and/or one or more of its Affiliates) would acquire the Members, and/or all
of the Members\' assets and liabilities, in a manner that would be superior
from Buyer\'s Tax perspective and neutral or superior in all respects to USF,
as compared to the structure otherwise contemplated by this Agreement.  
5.9 Directors\' Shares. With respect to all Shares of Members outstanding and
owned by directors on the date of this Agreement, USF shall cause such
Directors\' Shares to be transferred, at the Closing, to Buyer or Persons
designated by Buyer so that all of the capital stock of Members outstanding
at the conclusion of the Closing will be owned either by Buyer or Persons
designated by Buyer.   5.10 Removal of Certain Liens. Schedule 3.8(a)
discloses liens on two properties of SeitzSchenk Filtersystems GmbH in Bad
Kreuznach, Germany with a footnote indicating that such liens secure
underlying debt obligations that have been terminated. Prior to the Closing
Date, USF shall use all commercially reasonable best efforts to cause such
liens to be removed of record and, if they have not been so removed, USF at
its expense shall cause such liens to be removed as promptly as practicable
after the Closing.    32     ARTICLE VI   ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS  
6.1 Use of Names; Transfer of Intellectual Property Assets.   (a)
Notwithstanding any provision of Section 3.12 to the contrary, except to the
limited extent and for the limited time periods in subparagraphs (b) and (c)
of this Section 6.1 USF is not conveying to Buyer any ownership rights for,
or licensing Buyer to use, any of the following names: "USF," "U.S. Filter,"
"US Filter," "USFilter," "United States Filter Corp.," "United States Filter
Corporation" or any derivation or variation thereof (collectively,
the "Reserved Names"). With respect to all corporate names of Members,
Marks, fictional business names and trade names currently used by a Member or
Members or the Group and Internet domain names that include or consist in
part of a Reserved Name (collectively, "Group Names"): (i) Buyer shall be
permitted and entitled to use, and shall have the sole rights to, all Group
Names exclusive of any Reserved Name included in or forming a part thereof,
and (ii) USF and its Affiliates shall, after the Closing, have no right to
use all or part of any Group Name other than the Reserved Name included in or
forming a part thereof.   (b) After the Closing Buyer shall:   (i)
promptly (but in no event later than 120 days after the Closing) destroy all
stocks of written, printed or other graphic materials in its possession or
control that use or embody any names or marks of USF or any of its Affiliates
(other than the Members) including the Reserved Names or modify such
materials to remove or cover over any such names or marks; and   (ii)
promptly (but in no event later than 30 days after the Closing) remove or
cause to be removed any links from any of the Member\'s websites on the World
Wide Web to any website maintained by or on behalf of USF or its Affiliates
(other than the Members) and cease the use of any metatags utilizing any
Reserved Name or any confusingly similar word or phrase to direct traffic to
a website not owned by the owner of the Reserved Names.   (c) After the
Closing, USF shall and shall cause its Affiliates to:   (i) promptly (but
in no event later than 120 days after the Closing) destroy all stocks of
written, printed or other graphic materials in its possession or control that
use or embody any names or marks of the Members including the Member names or
modify such materials to remove or cover over any such names or marks and
cease all use of a Member name or a name confusingly similar to a Member
name;   (ii) promptly (but in no event later than 30 days after
the Closing) remove, disable or eliminate or cause to be removed, disabled
or eliminated from any website of USF and its Affiliates any links or
other references to any websites of the Members or the Group and cease the
use of any metatags utilizing any Member name or any confusingly similar word
or phrase to direct traffic to a website not owned by USF or its
Affiliates.    33   (d) Anything elsewhere herein to the contrary
notwithstanding but subject to the other provisions of this Section 6.1
regarding the use of the Reserved Names, any Intellectual Property Assets
which are owned by or licensed to USF or any of its Subsidiaries other than
Members and which are used in the conduct of the Business shall, at the
Closing, by appropriate instruments, either be transferred to Buyer or Buyer
shall be granted a permanent irrevocable royalty-free license to use the same
in the conduct of the Business after the Closing.   (e) It is expressly
understood and agreed by the Parties that Buyer shall not cause the Members
to undertake any business using, or otherwise act in, the Reserved Names
following the Closing Date, and that Buyer shall cause the Members to, on the
Closing Date, assign all rights to use the Reserved Names pursuant to an
assignment agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Parties to be delivered at Closing, and shall thereafter cause the Members to
change their legal names, if necessary to remove references to the Reserved
Names, by filing the necessary documents with the applicable Governmental
Bodies within thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. If Buyer fails to
make the filings required by the preceding sentence, USF shall be entitled,
beginning 31 days following the Closing Date, to file with the applicable
Governmental Bodies, at Buyer\'s expense, such amendments to the Members\'
Governing Documents as are necessary to effect such name changes, pursuant to
a power of attorney granting such power to USF placed in escrow on the
Closing Date with Sutherland Asbill and Brennan LLP pursuant to an
escrow letter. Said power of attorney and escrow letter shall be in forms
reasonably agreed upon by Sutherland Asbill and Brennan LLP and Carter, Ledyard
and Milburn.   (f) If either party violates any of its obligations under
this Section 6.1, the other party may proceed against it in law or in equity
for such damages or other relief as a court may deem appropriate. Each party
acknowledges that a violation of this Section 6.1 may cause the other party
irreparable harm which may not be adequately compensated for by money
damages. Each party therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this Section 6.1, the other party and its Affiliates
shall be entitled, in addition to other remedies that they may have, to a
temporary restraining order and to preliminary and final injunctive relief
against the breaching party to prevent any violations of this Section
6.1.   6.2 Tax Matters.   (a) Liability for Taxes.   (i) USF shall be
liable for and, pursuant to Article VIII, USF shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyer and the Members against all Taxes (whether assessed or
unassessed) (A) applicable to any Member (1) attributable to a Pre-Closing
Period, (2) pursuant to Treas. Reg. ss.1.1502-6 (or any comparable provision
under state, local or foreign law or regulation imposing several liability
upon members of a consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group) for
any Pre-Closing Period, (3) under any agreement entered into on or prior to
the Closing Date pursuant to which any Member is liable for the Taxes of any
other Person (except for customary agreements to indemnify lenders or
security holders in respect of Taxes), (4) as a result of any Member
having become liable, in a transaction prior to the Closing, as transferee or
successor for Taxes of any other Person, or (5) which would have been
attributable to a Pre-Closing Period but for (x) Code ss. 481 (or any
corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law)
as a result of a change in method of accounting for a Pre-Closing Period, or
(y) a "closing agreement" as described in Code ss. 7121 (or any corresponding
or similar provision of state, local or foreign income Tax law) executed on
or prior to the Closing Date; or (z) Treasury Regulations under Code ss.1502
(or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax
law) as a result of a deferred intercompany transaction, excess loss account
or similar event which arose in a Pre-Closing Period, or (B) attributable to
any Stamp Duty Clawbacks; provided, however, (I) in the case of Taxes imposed
on a Joint Venture Entity USF shall be liable to the Buyer for the product of
such Taxes and the percentage ownership of the Group in such Joint Venture
Entity as set forth opposite the name of such entity on Schedule A-3; (II)
USF shall not be liable for any Taxes (other than Income Taxes) to the extent
accrued on the books and records of the relevant Member and reflected in the
Closing Date Adjusted Net Assets; (III) any Taxes imposed on any Member as a
result of transactions occurring on the Closing Date that are properly
allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set forth in
Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date
after the Closing shall not be considered attributable to a Pre-
Closing Period; and (IV) USF shall not be liable for any interest or
penalties attributable to the negligence or bad faith of Buyer or its
Affiliates. USF shall be entitled to any refund of (or credit for) Taxes
allocable to any Pre-Closing Period unless such refund (or credit) is
reflected in Closing Date Adjusted Net Assets. Buyer or the appropriate
Member shall pay over to USF any such refund or the amount of any credit
within fifteen (15) days after receipt or crediting.    34    (ii)
Except as provided in Section 6.2(a)(i), Buyer shall be liable for and,
pursuant to Article VIII, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless USF and its
Related Parties against all Taxes (whether assessed or unassessed) applicable
to any Member (A) attributable to (1) taxable years or periods beginning
after the Closing Date, (2) transactions occurring on the Closing Date that
are properly allocable (based on, among other relevant factors, factors set
forth in Treas. Reg. ss. 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the
Closing Date after the Closing, and (3) with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date or (B)
to the extent such Taxes (other than Income Taxes) are accrued on the books
and records of the relevant Member and reflected in the Closing Date Adjusted
Net Assets. Except as otherwise provided herein, Buyer shall be entitled to
any refund of (or credit for) Taxes allocable to any taxable year or period
that begins after the Closing Date and, with respect to any Straddle Period,
the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date.  
(iii) For purposes of Section 6.2(a)(i) and Section 6.2(a)(ii), whenever it
is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period, the
determination of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the
Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle
Period consisted of two taxable years or periods, one which ended at the
close of the Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of
the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction,
loss or credit for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two
taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that
the relevant books including the relevant books and records of any Joint
Venture Entity (whether or not taxed on a flow-through basis) were closed at
the close of the Closing Date; provided, however, that (A) transactions
occurring on the Closing Date that are properly allocable (based on, among
other relevant factors, factors set forth in Treas. Reg. ss.
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B)) to the portion of the Closing Date after the Closing
shall be allocated to the taxable year or period that is deemed to begin at
the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and (B)
exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis,
such as the deduction for depreciation, shall be apportioned between such two
taxable years or periods on a daily basis and Taxes that are computed on a
periodic basis, such as property Taxes, shall also be so apportioned on a
daily basis. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph
(iii), if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement result in the
reassessment of the value of any property owned by any Member for property
Tax purposes, or the imposition of any property Taxes at a rate which is
different than the rate that would have been imposed if such transactions had
not occurred, then (x) the portion of such property Taxes for the portion of
the Straddle Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall be
determined on a daily basis, using the assessed value and Tax rate that would
have applied had such transactions not occurred, and (y) the portion of such
property Taxes for the portion of such Straddle Period beginning after the
Closing Date shall be the total property Taxes for the Straddle Period minus
the amount described in clause (x) of this sentence. Sales and use Taxes (and
their foreign equivalents, including VAT) shall be deemed to accrue in
accordance with GAAP.    35    (iv) USF or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall provide reimbursement for any Tax paid by one Party all or a portion of
which is the responsibility of the other Party in accordance with the terms
of this Section 6.2(a). Within a reasonable time prior to the payment of any
such Tax, the Party paying such Tax shall give written notice to the other
Party of the Tax payable and the portion which is the liability of each
Party, although failure to do so will not relieve the other Party from its
liability hereunder.   (v) If, as a result of any action, suit,
investigation, audit, claim, assessment or amended Tax Return, there is any
change after the Closing Date in an item of income, gain, loss, deduction,
credit or amount of Tax that results in an increase in Tax liability for
which USF would otherwise be liable pursuant to this Section 6.2(a), and such
change results in a net decrease in the Tax liability of Buyer for taxable
years or periods beginning after the Closing Date (including the portion of
any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date), USF shall be liable
only for the net amount of such increase after taking into account such
decrease in accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.2(a) (and, to
the extent such increase in Tax liability is paid to a taxing authority by
USF or any Affiliate thereof, Buyer shall pay USF an amount equal to such
decrease).   (vi) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing in Section 3.7 shall cause USF to be liable to Buyer
for any amounts relating to any Taxes for which USF is not expressly liable
pursuant to this Section 6.2.   (b) Tax Returns.    36    (i) USF
shall have the exclusive authority and obligation on behalf of the U.S.
Members to prepare, execute and timely file, or cause to be prepared,
executed and timely filed, all federal and state income Tax Returns of the
U.S. Members that are due with respect to any taxable period ending prior
to or ending on and including the Closing Date, provided, however, that any
Tax Return prepared by USF shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax
Return in a manner consistent with the prior Tax Returns of the relevant
Member. USF will take no position on any such Tax Return that would adversely
affect a Member after the Closing Date unless such position is clearly proper
and would be reasonable in the case of a Person that owned the Member both
before and after the Closing Date.   (ii) Except as provided in Section
6.2(b)(i), Buyer shall have the exclusive authority and obligation to prepare
and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns of
the Members. Any Tax Return prepared by Buyer with respect to a Pre-Closing
Period shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Return in a manner
consistent with the prior practices and positions of the relevant Member(s)
unless such treatment is not permitted by applicable Law. With respect to any
such Tax Return which includes a Pre-Closing Period for which USF may be
required to indemnify Buyer under Article VIII, Buyer shall provide USF with
draft copies of such Tax Returns and an opportunity to review and comment on
such Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days prior to the date for filing such
Tax Returns. Buyer shall in good faith take into account such comments in its
preparation of such Tax Returns.   (c) Tax Audits.   (i) Buyer shall
promptly notify USF in writing upon receipt by Buyer or any of its Affiliates
of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign Tax
audits, examinations, notices of deficiency or other adjustments, assessments
or redeterminations ("Tax Matters") relating to a Pre-Closing Period for
which USF may be liable to indemnify Buyer under Article VIII.   (ii) USF
shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and defend against any
Tax Matters or initiate any claim for refund or amend any Tax Return relating
to the Income Taxes (and, after Buyer\'s Recoverable Losses have reached the
threshold set forth in Section 8.2(a), the Taxes) of any Member for Pre-
Closing Periods other than Straddle Periods, in each case provided USF is
obligated to indemnify Buyer for such Taxes under Article VIII, and to employ
counsel of its choice at its own expense; provided, however, that (A) USF
shall keep Buyer informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature
of any such Tax Matter, (B) USF shall conduct such Tax Matter in a manner
that would be reasonable in the case of a Person that continued to own the
Member, (C) neither USF nor the ultimate U.S. parent entity filing the
consolidated return that is the subject of such Tax Matter nor any of their
respective Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of or otherwise
compromise any such Tax Matter which adversely affects or may adversely
affect the Tax liability of Buyer, any of the Members or any Affiliate of the
foregoing (to the extent Buyer, any of the Members or any Affiliate of the
foregoing may be required to make any payment for such Tax liability that
is not fully indemnified by USF pursuant to the terms hereof) without the
prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, and (D) USF may decline to control any Tax Matters by
providing Buyer with written notice of such decision.    37    (iii)
Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.2(c)(ii), Buyer shall have the sole
right to control any Tax Matters relating to any Member, and to employ
counsel of its choice; provided, however, that (A) Buyer shall keep USF
informed with respect to the commencement, status and nature of any Tax
Matter for which USF may be liable pursuant to Article VIII, and (B) neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall enter into any settlement of
or otherwise compromise any Tax Matter for which USF is required to indemnify
Buyer hereunder without the prior written consent of USF, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. USF shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer and the Members against any costs or expenses reasonably
incurred by them in contesting their liability for Taxes for which USF is
liable under Section 6.2(a)(i).   (iv) In the event that Buyer fails to
notify USF with respect to a Tax Matter in accordance with the provisions of
Section 6.2(c)(i), USF shall not be obligated to indemnify Buyer under
Article VIII of this Agreement with respect to such Tax Matter to the extent
that such failure to notify USF adversely affects USF\'s ability to
adequately defend against such Tax Matter under Section 6.2(c)(ii).   (v)
Neither the Buyer nor any Member may extend any statutory period of
limitations for Taxes for a Pre-Closing Period (other than a Straddle Period)
by giving any waiver or agreeing to any extension thereof without the express
prior written consent of USF, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.   (d) Assistance and Cooperation. After the Closing
Date, each of USF and Buyer shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, including each of the Members, to):   (i) assist the other
Party in preparing any Tax Returns which such other Party is responsible for
preparing and filing in accordance with Section 6.2(b);   (ii) upon
reasonable notice and without undue interruption to the business of such
Party or the Members, provide access during normal business hours to the
books and records of such Party relating to the Taxes of the Members prior to
the Closing Date;   (iii) furnish the other with copies of all
correspondence received from any taxing authority in connection with any Tax
Matter or information request with respect to any taxable period for which
the other may have a liability under this Section 6.2;   (iv) timely
provide to the other powers of attorney or similar authorizations reasonably
necessary to carry out the purposes of this Section 6.2; and   (v) assist
in a timely manner in the preparation of tax related aspects (including the
calculation under GAAP of Income Tax accounts as of the Closing Date) of the
initial financial statements prepared by the other Party following the
Closing Date.   (e) Prior Tax Agreements. USF and the Members shall
terminate or cause to be terminated any and all Tax sharing agreements in
effect on the Closing Date as between USF or any Affiliate thereof (other
than the Members), on the one hand, and any of the Members, on the other
hand, for all Taxes imposed by any government or taxing authority, regardless
of the period in which such Taxes are imposed, and there shall be no
continuing obligation to make any payments under any such agreements after
the Closing Date.     38    (f) Disputes. If the Parties disagree as to
the calculation of any amount relating to Taxes governed by this Section 6.2,
the Parties shall promptly consult with each other in an effort to resolve
the disagreement. If any such disagreement is not resolved within 30 days
after either Party gives the other written notice that it cannot be resolved,
the Parties shall jointly select a firm of nationally recognized independent
accountants (or, if they cannot agree on the selection of such a firm within
that 30-day period, the default firm specified in Section 2.4) to resolve the
disagreement. Such firm\'s determination shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the Parties, and any expenses relating to the engagement of
such firm shall be shared equally by the Parties.   (g) Purchase Price
Adjustment. Any payment by Buyer or USF to or on behalf of the other under
this Section 6.2 will be an adjustment to the Purchase Price even though such
payment may be made after the period specified in Section 2.4(a).   (h)
Carrybacks. USF will promptly pay to Buyer any Tax refund (or reduction in
Tax liability) resulting from a carryback of a post-acquisition Tax attribute
of any Member to a Tax Return of the Affiliated Group, when such refund or
reduction is realized by the Affiliated Group. USF will cooperate with Buyer
in obtaining such refunds (or reductions in Tax liability), including through
the filing of amended Tax Returns or refund claims. Buyer agrees to indemnify
USF for any Taxes resulting from the disallowance of such post-acquisition
Tax attribute on audit or otherwise.   (i) Section 338 Elections.   (i)
Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.2(i), at Buyer\'s option, USF
will, and will cause any required Affiliate to, join with Buyer in making one
or more timely elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and/or
corresponding elections under any state or local Law relating to Taxes) with
respect to the direct or indirect acquisition of any Member hereunder
(collectively "Section 338(h)(10) Elections"). Buyer shall in its
sole discretion be entitled to make one or more elections under Section
338(g) of the Code for any Member (all such elections together with all
Section 338(h)(10) Elections, hereafter the "Section 338 Elections").   
39    (ii) In the event that Buyer considers making one or more Section
338 Elections, Buyer shall provide to USF all information reasonably required
by USF (and not otherwise in its possession) to compute the Excess Section
338 Tax Liability (as defined below), including, with respect to a Section
338(h)(10) Election, the allocation among the assets of the relevant Member
of the portion of the grossed-up Purchase Price attributable to such Member
in accordance with the regulations under Section 338 of the Code,
an allocation among the states in which such assets are physically located,
and a schedule setting forth any and all transfer, sales and use,
registration, documentary, stamp and similar Taxes resulting from the Section
338(h)(10) Election. Buyer shall also provide to USF written notice of any
election made under Section 338(g) for a Member, and shall provide USF all
information reasonably required by USF to report the transactions resulting
from such election, including information with respect to items of such
Member arising during the portion of USF\'s taxable year which is after the
Closing Date. USF shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
assist Buyer in obtaining in a timely manner any information Buyer may deem
relevant in determining whether to make one or more Section 338 Elections,
provided that Buyer shall reimburse USF for any related out-of-pocket costs
incurred by USF in obtaining or calculating such information. USF agrees that
Buyer may select and instruct any third party retained to obtain or calculate
information as contemplated in the preceding sentences. Within forty-five
(45) days following receipt by USF of the information required by USF and not
otherwise in its possession, USF shall provide Buyer with an estimate of the
combined net amount of federal, state, local and foreign Taxes (including all
transfer, sales and use, value added, registration, documentary, stamp and
similar Taxes and taking into account all Tax benefits) related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (A) for which USF or its
Affiliates would be liable if such Section 338 Elections were made and (B)
for which USF and its Affiliates would be liable if the Section 338 Elections
were not made (the amount of the excess of (A) over (B), if any, shall be
hereinafter referred to as the "Excess Section 338 Tax Liability"), and
USF shall provide Buyer with calculations supporting USF\'s estimate of the
Excess Section 338 Tax Liability, including information with respect to the
tax basis of the stock (and, in the case of any Section 338(h)(10) Election,
the tax basis of the assets) of the Members with respect to which the Section
338 Elections are proposed to be made. USF and Buyer agree to use good faith
efforts to resolve any disagreement with respect to the computation of the
Excess Section 338 Tax Liability. For purposes of computing the Excess
Section 338 Tax Liability, a net operating loss or capital loss which is
attributable to a Member shall be taken into account; however, a net
operating loss or capital loss which is attributable to an entity other than
a Member shall be taken into account in computing the Tax liability resulting
under the Section 338 Elections only to the extent of the amount of such loss
which is taken into account in determining the Taxes for which USF and its
Affiliates would be liable on the sale of the USFCA Shares if the Section 338
Elections were not made.   (iii) At any time following the calculation of
the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability, Buyer may notify USF of its intention
to make a Section 338 Election and USF shall, or shall cause any required
Affiliate to, join in any Section 338(h)(10) Election pursuant to the
provisions of Section 6.2(i)(i). Buyer shall, prepare all such Section 338
Election forms and attachments in accordance with applicable Tax Laws, at its
own expense and with the assistance and cooperation of USF. With respect to a
Section 338(h)(10) Election, Buyer shall provide USF with draft copies of
such forms and attachments and an opportunity to review and comment with
respect thereto at least ten (10) days prior to the filing due date thereof.
Buyer shall in good faith take into account USF\'s comments in its
preparation of such forms and attachments.   (iv) If Section 338 Elections
are made, then not later than thirty (30) days after Buyer makes such Section
338 Elections, Buyer shall pay to USF in immediately available funds to an
account designated by USF an amount equal to the net Excess Section 338 Tax
Liability related to all such Section 338 Elections plus (z) all interest
accrued on such Excess Section 338 Tax Liability to the date of payment and
(zz) all penalties imposed on USF to the date of payment as a result of the
late payment of such Excess Section 338 Tax Liability, calculated on an
"after-tax basis," which shall mean an amount which is sufficient to fully
compensate USF for the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability plus interest and
penalties, determined after taking into account the net increase in Taxes
payable by USF or its Affiliates as a result of the payment pursuant to this
Section 6.2(i)(iv), such that USF and its Affiliates are placed in the same
position on an after tax basis that they would have been in had the Section
338 Elections not been made. USF shall have no obligation to pay any of the
Excess Section 338 Tax Liability to the relevant taxing authority prior
to receipt of payment under this Section 6.2(i)(iv). USF shall provide Buyer
with reasonably detailed evidence of payment made to the relevant taxing
authorities with respect to the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability, penalties
and interest within ten (10) days of USF or its Affiliates making such
payment.    40    (v) If at any time an allocation of the Purchase
Price prepared by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.2(i)(ii) is redetermined by any
taxing authority and as a result of such redetermination the amount of the
Excess Section 338 Tax Liability is greater than or less than the original
estimate of such amount, Buyer shall promptly pay to USF (if the amount of
the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability is greater than the original estimate of
such amount) or USF shall promptly reimburse to Buyer (if the amount of the
Excess Section 338 Tax Liability is less than the original estimate of such
amount), in each case on an "after-tax basis," the difference between such
original estimate and the amount of the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability
after taking into account such redetermination. USF shall notify Buyer of,
and agrees to use and to cause its Affiliates to use reasonable good faith
efforts in contesting, any claim by a taxing authority that would result in
an increase in the amount of the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability as a result
of such redetermination; provided that to the extent Buyer requests that USF
or its Affiliates contest any such claim, Buyer reserves the right to control
and direct such contest of any such claim and shall reimburse USF or its
Affiliates, as applicable, for reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred in
connection with any such contest which is within the scope of Buyer\'s
request. Notwithstanding the foregoing, USF or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall not have any liability to the other Party under this Section 6.2(i)(v)
unless and until the aggregate amount of the liability of USF or Buyer
pursuant to this Section 6.2(i)(v) exceeds $100,000, in which event
the entire amount of such liability shall be recoverable.   (vi) The
valuations and allocations prepared by Buyer pursuant to Section 6.2(i)(ii)
and used to compute the Excess Section 338 Tax Liability shall be used for
purposes of all relevant Tax Returns, reports and filings made by USF, Buyer
and their respective Affiliates, unless it would be unreasonable to do
so.   6.3 Employees and Employee Benefit Plans.   (a) Notice to Employees.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.3, on or prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer and USF shall jointly give notice to all employees who are then
employed by one of the Members (the "Affected Employees") that all benefits
previously provided to the Affected Employees under the USF Employee Benefit
Plans are discontinued on the Closing Date with respect to such Affected
Employees and will be replaced by the employee benefit plans of the Buyer
(the "Buyer Benefit Programs"). Such notice shall also inform the Affected
Employees of the effect of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement on
the Vivendi Employment Benefit Plans. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 6.3, Buyer may amend or terminate the Buyer Benefit Programs at
any time for any reason.    41    (b) Credit for Prior Service. Buyer
agrees that the Affected Employees shall be credited with their length of
service with the Members and USF and its Affiliates under the policies of the
Buyer and for all purposes under the Buyer Benefit Programs (other than for
purposes of benefit accrual under a pension plan as defined in Section 3(2)
of ERISA and early retirement subsidies under a defined benefit plan as
defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA) after the Closing.   (c) Vacation; Sick
Leave. Buyer shall take responsibility for and cause to be paid in the normal
course of business the vacation pay of all Affected Employees for all days of
vacation to which each such employee was entitled under USF\'s or the
applicable Member\'s vacation pay policy as of the Closing Date. For purposes
of computing eligibility for and the amount of vacation or holiday pay of
Affected Employees to be accrued after the Closing, employment of such
employees by any of the Members or USF or any of its Affiliates prior to
Closing shall be taken into account to the same extent as if it had been
employment by the Members or Buyer. Buyer shall credit all Affected Employees
with all days of accrued sick leave to which such employees were entitled as
of the Closing Date under USF\'s or the applicable Member\'s sick leave
policy as of the Closing Date.   (d) Existing Claims. USF shall retain the
responsibility for payment of all covered medical and dental claims or
expenses actually incurred by any employee (or covered dependent of any
employee) of any U.S. Member (i) prior to the Closing Date and (ii) during a
continuous period of hospitalization which commences on or before the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing Date, and in each such case Buyer shall not
assume nor shall Buyer or any U.S. Member be responsible for any liability
with respect to such claims or expenses.   (e) COBRA. USF shall be
responsible for providing any employee of any U.S. Member whose "qualifying
event" within the meaning of COBRA occurs prior to the Closing Date (and such
employees\' "qualified beneficiaries" within the meaning of COBRA) and for
providing any "qualified beneficiaries" of any employee of any U.S. Member
whose "qualifying event" occurs prior to the Closing Date with COBRA
continuation coverage, and, if the Closing occurs, Buyer shall be responsible
for providing such COBRA continuation coverage to the extent required by Law
for any U.S. Member employee whose qualifying event occurs on or after the
Closing Date.   (f) Disability. If the Closing occurs, Buyer and the
Members shall be responsible for short-term disability benefits and long-term
disability benefits for those Affected Employees of any U.S. Member who
became disabled prior to or after the Closing Date; provided, however, that
USF shall retain responsibility for any long-term disability benefits for any
employee of any U.S. Member who had qualified for long-term disability
benefits as of the Closing Date and for any long-term disability benefits for
any employee of any U.S. Member who had qualified for short-term disability
benefits as of the Closing Date and who subsequently qualifies for long-term
disability benefits as a consequence of the same injury or disability.  
(g) WARN Act. Buyer shall be responsible for all liabilities or obligations
under the WARN Act resulting from Buyer\'s or any of the Member\'s actions
following the Closing.    42    (h) Transfer from the USF 401(k) Plan.
As of a date (the "Account Transfer Date") as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, USF shall cause to be transferred from the USF 401(k) Plan to
the 401(k) plan sponsored by the Buyer (the "Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan") cash or
property acceptable to Buyer in an amount equal to the aggregate balances of
all participants in the USF 401(k) Plan as of such Account Transfer Date who,
as of the Closing, are employed by any U.S. Member ("U.S. Company
Employees"), including actual investment earnings or losses through the
Account Transfer Date, except that all promissory notes reflecting
participant loans to U.S. Company Employees outstanding as of such Account
Transfer Date shall be transferred in kind and except for any amounts as to
which withdrawal requests have been duly submitted prior to such transfer and
which shall be paid by the USF 401(k) Plan to U.S. Company Employees in
accordance with ERISA and the Code and the terms of the USF 401(k) Plan (the
"Transferred Assets"). As of the Account Transfer Date, Buyer shall assume
all liabilities applicable to U.S. Company Employees under the USF 401(k)
Plan to pay benefits, consistent with the terms of the USF 401(k) Plan, equal
to the amount transferred. In the event any U.S. Company Employee has
a qualified domestic relations order pending or approved in the USF 401(k)
Plan at the time of transfer, all documentation concerning such qualified
domestic relations order shall be assigned to the Buyer\'s 401(k) Plan. USF
and the Buyer agree to cooperate fully with respect to any governmental
filings, including but not limited to the filing of any Internal Revenue
Service Form 5310A reporting obligations, information and procedures
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this Section 6.3(h).
Pending the transfer of the Transferred Assets, the accounts of the U.S.
Company Employees shall remain in the trust fund for the USF 401(k) Plan and
USF shall cause the trustee of the USF 401(k) Plan to pay any current
benefits or make any distributions to U.S. Company Employees, including,
without limitation, such benefits as may be payable to U.S. Company Employees
on account of termination of employment with the U.S. Members, as they become
due. USF and Buyer agree to provide each other with such records and
information as they may reasonably request relating to their respective
obligations under this Section 6.3 or the administration of the USF 401(k)
Plan or the Buyer 401(k) Plan. As of the Closing Date, Buyer agrees to cause
any U.S. Member to remit to the trustee of the USF 401(k) Plan all matching
contributions for periods on or before the Closing Date due to the USF 401(k)
Plan from any U.S. Member which have not been paid as of the Closing Date.
USF agrees to amend the USF 401(k) Plan pursuant to Treasury
Regulation Section 1.411(d)-4 (QandA2;(e)) to eliminate as of or prior to the
Account Transfer Date any and all non-lump sum and in-kind optional forms of
benefit and to provide notice to affected participants in the USF 401(k) Plan
in accordance with such regulation at least 90 days prior to the Account
Transfer Date and deliver a copy of such notice to Buyer before the Account
Transfer Date.   (i) USF Flexible Benefit Plan. After the Closing Date,
Buyer shall adopt a cafeteria plan under Section 125 of the Code and under
such plan shall honor claims by U.S. Company Employees with respect to
deferrals made by such U.S. Company Employees during calendar 2002 under the
United States Filter Corporation Section 125 Flexible Benefit Plan; provided,
however, that at the Closing, USF shall transfer to Buyer all amounts that
USF has received in respect of such deferrals, net of any amounts previously
paid out by USF to U.S. Company Employees in respect of eligible medical and
dependent care expenses incurred in 2002.    43    (j) USF Management
Deferred Compensation Plan. As soon as practicable following the Closing
Date, Buyer agrees to cause each of the U.S. Members to remit to the trustee
of the United States Filter Corporation Management Deferred Compensation Plan
(the "USF MDCP") all amounts required to be withheld from employees\' pay as
described on Schedule 3.13(d), in respect of U.S. Company Employees
participating in the USF MDCP.   6.4 Insurance.   (a) Termination by USF.
Effective as of the Closing Date, USF will cause the termination of all
coverage relating to the Members, the Business or any of the Member\'s assets
and current or former employees and directors under policies of insurance
that cover USF or any of its Subsidiaries as well as Members. USF will not
take any action that would affect the coverage of one or more Members under
any policies of insurance maintained solely by or on behalf of any
Member.   (b) Information. To the extent that after the Closing
either Party requires any information from the other Party regarding claim
data, payroll or other information in order to make filings with insurance
carriers or self insurance regulators, the other Party will promptly supply
such information.   (c) Workers Compensation. USF shall retain
responsibility to administer and pay all workers compensation claims made by
U.S. Company Employees prior to March 1, 2001. If the Closing occurs, Buyer
shall be responsible to administer and pay all workers compensation claims
made by U.S. Company Employees on or after March 1, 2001 but prior to the
Closing Date up to a stop-loss amount of $250,000 per individual claim;
provided, however, that Buyer shall not be responsible for any such claims
which have as of the Closing Date been settled or paid by a Member, USF or
its Affiliates and shall not be obligated to reimburse USF or its Affiliates
for any amounts paid by USF, its Affiliates or a Member prior to the Closing
pursuant to a claim that has not been settled as of the Closing Date. USF
shall be responsible for any amounts in excess of the stop-loss amount with
respect to claims made on or after March 1, 2001 that relate to the period
prior to the Closing; provided, that Buyer notifies USF of any such claims
that are filed after Closing in accordance with procedures established by USF
and communicated to Buyer in writing at the time of the Closing. Schedule 6.4
contains a list of pending workers compensation claims indicating the date of
incident. USF and Buyer will cooperate with one another after the Closing
Date and will provide access to claims data, medical history and employment
records as may be reasonably required to effect the cost-efficient resolution
of such outstanding claims. The amounts payable by USF pursuant to this
paragraph shall not be deemed indemnification payments for purposes of
Article VIII and, accordingly, shall not be subject to any of the limitations
or other provisions of that Article.   6.5 Securities Law Compliance and
Legends. Buyer agrees and understands that the USFCA Shares have not been,
and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any state. Accordingly, Buyer will not sell or otherwise dispose of the
USFCA Shares except in one or more transactions registered under the
Securities Act and applicable state securities laws or as to which an
exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws is available.    44    6.6 No Public
Announcement. Neither Buyer, USF nor their respective Affiliates shall,
without the written approval of the other Party, make any press release or
other public announcement concerning the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as and to the extent that any such Person shall be so
obligated by Law, in which case the other Party to this Agreement shall be
advised and the Parties shall use their best efforts to cause a mutually
agreeable release or announcement to be issued; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary
to implement the provisions of this Agreement or to comply with
applicable accounting and disclosure obligations of any Governmental Body or
the rules of any stock exchange.   6.7 Expenses. Except as otherwise
specifically provided in this Agreement, each Party will pay all costs and
expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and to
its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained
herein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the fees,
expenses and disbursements of its counsel, investment banker and independent
public accountants and the filing fees payable in connection with each
Party\'s respective filing required by the HSR Act and any similar filing
with any non-United States Governmental Body.   6.8 Environmental Access.
USF shall grant access to Buyer and its employees, agents and representatives
to the facilities of the Group for such non-invasive environmental
inspections as Buyer reasonably deems necessary or desirable, will make
available for interviews employees with managerial responsibility for
environmental matters at the Group\'s facilities, and will authorize Buyer
and its employees, agents and representatives to gain access to governmental
records concerning environmental matters that relate to or affect facilities
of the Group.   6.9 Employees. (a) For a period of two (2) years following
the Closing, neither USF nor any of its Subsidiaries shall induce or seek to
induce any salaried employee of any Member to leave the employ of such
Member. For a period of one (1) year following the Closing, neither USF nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall employ or otherwise engage as an employee,
independent contractor or otherwise, any salaried employee of any Member
unless such person\'s employment has been terminated by Buyer or a Member for
reasons other than cause (in which case such person could be employed by USF
immediately following such termination). USF and its Subsidiaries shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to comply with the requirements of the
preceding sentence. In the event that either USF or its Subsidiaries employ a
person in violation of this provision, the Buyer\'s sole remedy shall be to
require USF or the applicable Subsidiary to terminate such person\'s
employment promptly upon providing USF with notice of such violation. Buyer
shall provide USF with written notice at the time of termination of each
salaried employee of any Member during the one year following the Closing and
upon request by USF, Buyer shall advise USF as to whether a particular
employee whose employment was terminated by Buyer or a Member is deemed by
Buyer to have been terminated "for cause" for purposes of this paragraph.
Notwithstanding the terms of this Section 6.9(a) to the contrary, (i) Buyer
agrees that, should Buyer inform USF in writing at any time on or after the
Closing Date that it or the Members will not continue to employ Andy Denver
and/or David McGarvey or should Buyer or a Member at any time after the
Closing terminate the employment of either of them without giving
such notice, then immediately following the date of such notice or such
termination USF may offer employment to and hire the individual or
individuals as to whom such notice or termination applies, and (ii) USF
agrees that (x) should Buyer or the Members desire to continue Andy Denver\'s
employment following the Closing Date, USF shall assign its rights under its
employment agreement with Andy Denver to Buyer or one of the Members, and (y)
if Buyer or the Members terminate at any time following the Closing Date Andy
Denver\'s and/or David McGarvey\'s employment with Buyer or the Members and
USF hires such person(s) pursuant to the terms of (i) above, USF shall use
its good faith efforts to cause such employees to make themselves reasonably
available, for up to two years following the Closing Date, to Buyer and the
Members, during normal business hours, on a limited basis (in such a manner
as will not interfere with their normal job duties) to answer any questions
related to the operations of the Members prior to Closing.    45    (b)
Buyer also agrees that for a period of one (1) year following the Closing,
Buyer shall use its good faith efforts not to directly solicit (other than by
way of generalized or mass media advertising) or hire any employee of USF or
its Subsidiaries known to be working in research and development.   6.10
Assignment. Buyer shall have the right to assign this Agreement to an
Affiliate of Buyer provided that Pall Corporation shall remain the
primary obligor as to all of the obligations of Buyer under this Agreement
until the Closing.   6.11 Shared Facilities. Between the date of this
Agreement and the Closing Date, Buyer and USF shall use commercially
reasonable good faith efforts to, effective as of the Closing Date, enter
into mutually acceptable agreements with respect to, or terminate all
occupancy arrangements relating to, the Shared Facilities (all of which are
identified on Schedule 3.8(d)). In the absence of an agreement regarding such
arrangements as of the Closing Date, all occupancy arrangements relating to
the Shared Facilities shall continue for a period not to exceed six months
following the Closing Date, on terms at least as favorable to the applicable
Member as are in effect as of the date hereof, provided, however, that the
parties agree to use their commercially reasonable good faith efforts to
reach a mutually acceptable arrangement regarding such Shared Facilities
prior to the six month anniversary of the Closing Date.   6.12 Agreements
with USF and Affiliates. USF shall notify Buyer and provide Buyer with all of
the material terms of and copies of any agreements proposed to be entered
into between any Member and USF and/or any Affiliate of USF at any time
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date. The Members shall
not enter into any such agreements unless and until Buyer shall consent to
such agreements.   6.13 Legal Opinion of USF. At the Closing, USF shall
cause to be delivered to Buyer an opinion of its Executive Vice President and
General Counsel, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 1.   6.14 Legal
Opinion of Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer shall cause to be delivered to USF an
opinion of its Senior Vice President and General Counsel as to the matters
set forth in Exhibit 2 attached hereto.   6.15 Noncompetition.    
46    (a) Agreement Not to Compete. Except as provided in Section 6.15(c),
USF agrees that during the Non-Compete Period, it shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries (so long as they remain Subsidiaries of USF) not to,
engage in a Prohibited Activity anywhere in the Territory.   (b)

including by way of a purchase of assets or securities or by way of merger or
consolidation, any Acquired Business even if twenty-five (25%) or more of the

shall use (or cause the Subsidiary of USF that acquired such Acquired
Business to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to dispose (in whole or
in part) of all or some business units of such Acquired Business that is then
engaged in such Prohibited Activity as soon as practicable after the

nonperformance or noncompliance would not have a Material Adverse Effect.  
(b) Orders; Litigation. No statute, regulation or order of any Governmental
Body shall be in effect that restrains or prohibits the transactions
contemplated hereby, and no proceeding shall have been commenced that
restrains or prohibits the consummation of all or any portion of
the transactions contemplated hereby.   (c) Antitrust. All waiting periods
applicable to the consummation of the USFCA Share Transfer under the HSR Act
and other Antitrust Laws shall have expired or been terminated, and all
clearances and approvals required to be obtained in respect of the USFCA
Share Transfer prior to the Closing shall have been obtained.    51   
7.3 Termination.   (a) Termination of Agreement. This Agreement may be
terminated at any time prior to the Closing by: (i) mutual consent of Buyer
and USF; (ii) Buyer, if any of the conditions specified in Section 7.1 hereof
shall not have been fulfilled by August 1, 2002 and shall not have been
waived by Buyer; (iii) USF, if any of the conditions specified in Section 7.2
hereof shall not have been fulfilled by August 1, 2002 and shall not have
been waived by USF; or (iv) by either USF or Buyer if a Governmental Body
shall have issued a nonappealable final order, decree or ruling or taken any
other nonappealable final action having the effect of permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the USFCA Share Transfer.  
(b) Remedies. In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Buyer
or USF pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of the preceding Section 7.3(a),
Buyer, on the one hand, and USF, on the other hand, shall be liable to the
other for any breach hereof by such Party, which breach led to
such termination. Buyer and USF shall be entitled to seek any remedy to which
such Party may be entitled at law or in equity in the event of such
termination, which remedies shall include injunctive relief and specific
performance.   (c) Limitations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that this Agreement is terminated by one Party pursuant to clause (ii)
or (iii) of the first sentence of subsection (a) solely as a result of a
failure by the other Party to satisfy the conditions set forth in Article VII
which failure could not have been reasonably anticipated by such other Party
and was beyond the reasonable control of such other Party, then the remedy of
the Party terminating this Agreement shall be limited solely to recovery of
all of such Party\'s reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
herewith.   ARTICLE VIII   INDEMNIFICATION   8.1 Survival of
Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements. Subject to the
provisions of this Article VIII, the representations and warranties of USF
contained in Article III and those of the Buyer contained in Article IV and
the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing (and any investigation by the Parties with respect to
such representations and warranties) but shall terminate and be of no further
force or effect on the second anniversary of the Closing Date and no claims
shall be made by any Indemnified Party (as hereinafter defined) under this
Section 8.1 thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) any
such representation or warranty as to which a claim relating thereto is
asserted in writing (which states with specificity the basis therefor) in
accordance with Section 8.3 during such survival period shall, with respect
only to such claim, continue in force and effect beyond such survival period
pending resolution of such claim, (b) the representations and warranties of
USF set forth in Section 3.3(c) shall survive forever, (c) the
representations and warranties of USF set forth in Section 3.7, Section
3.13(k) and the covenants of USF and Buyer set forth in Section 6.2 shall
survive until the expiration of the relevant statutory period of limitations
applicable to the underlying claims, (d) the covenants and agreements in this
Article VIII shall survive the Closing and shall remain in full force and
effect for such period as is necessary to resolve any claim made with respect
to any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement during the survival period thereof, and (e) the remaining covenants
and agreements of the Parties contained in Article VI of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing without any contractual limitation on the period of
survival.    52    8.2 General Indemnification. If the transactions
contemplated hereby occur at the Closing, subject to the provisions of
Section 8.1:   (a) Indemnification by USF and Buyer. Each of the Buyer and
USF hereby agrees (in such capacity, an "Indemnifying Party"), from and after
the Closing, to indemnify and hold harmless the other Party and its Related
Parties (in such capacity, an "Indemnified Party") against any Losses that
such Indemnified Party shall actually incur, to the extent that such Losses
(or claims, actions, suits or proceedings in respect thereof and any
appeals therefrom ("Proceedings")):   (i) arise out of any breach of any
representation or warranty made herein in Article III (or out of any matter
that would have been such a breach but for the fact that it did not itself
constitute a Material Adverse Effect) (other than Section 3.7, for which the
remedies are specified in Section 6.2) for the benefit of the Buyer or in
Article IV for the benefit of USF; or   (ii) arise out of any failure to
perform any covenant made herein by the Indemnifying Party for the benefit of
the Indemnified Party.   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying
Party shall not have any liability to the Indemnified Party under this
Section 8.2(a) unless and until the aggregate amount of all Recoverable
Losses exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price, in which event only the amount of
Recoverable Losses in excess of .5% of the Purchase Price shall be
recoverable; and the liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Section
8.2(a) shall not exceed 50% of the Purchase Price in the aggregate; provided,
however, that the limitations set forth in this sentence shall not apply with
respect to USF\'s liability to Buyer (x) for Income Taxes of any Member for
Pre-Closing Periods as set forth in Section 6.2(a)(i)(A)(1), (2) and (5) and
related costs and expenses pursuant to the last sentence of Section
6.2(c)(iii), (y) for any applicable Stamp Duty Clawback or (z) arising out of
breaches of Section 3.3(c) or Section 3.17. All indemnity payments made under
this Article VIII shall be treated as adjustments to the Purchase Price, even
though such payments may be made after the period specified in Section
2.4(c). For the purposes of determining the amount of Losses incurred by an
Indemnified Party in accordance with this Article VIII, such Losses shall be
offset by (i) the proceeds of any insurance received by the Indemnified Party
with respect thereto and (ii) the amount of any Income Tax benefit actually
realized by the Indemnified Party with respect thereto.   (b) Limitations.
USF shall not be liable for any Losses resulting from a breach of any of the
representations, warranties and covenants set forth in Article III of this
Agreement or any of the covenants set forth in Article VI of this Agreement
to the extent that:   (i) the liability for such breach occurs or is
increased as a result of the adoption or imposition of any Law not in force
at the date of this Agreement or as a result of any increase in rates of
taxation after the date of this Agreement; or    53     (ii) the
Losses would not have arisen but for a change in accounting policy or
practice of the Buyer or any Member after the Closing.   (c) Waiver of
Conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, to
the extent that USF or the Buyer waives in writing satisfaction of one or
more of the conditions set forth in Section 7.1 or Section 7.2, which
conditions were not satisfied due to the occurrence of one or more events,
conditions or circumstances that was specifically disclosed in writing
(including by inclusion on a Schedule hereto) to USF or the
Buyer, respectively, prior to the Closing, the disclosing Party shall not be
liable for any Losses resulting from such matter or matters to the extent so
disclosed.   (d) Indemnification by Buyer. To the fullest extent permitted
by Law, the Buyer hereby agrees, from and after the Closing, to indemnify and
hold harmless USF and its Related Parties against any Losses incurred by such
Person to the extent that such Losses (i) arise out of or are based upon the
ownership and operation of the Group from and after the Closing Date, (ii)
relate to Taxes which are the obligation of the Buyer or the Members in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.2, or (iii) arise out of a breach
of Section 4.5. This indemnification shall be in addition to (but not in
duplication of) the indemnification provided under Section 8.2(a) and shall
not be subject to the thresholds, deductibles and other limitations on amount
set forth in Section 8.2(a).   8.3 Procedures.    (a) Notice of Claim.
Promptly after receipt by the Indemnified Party under Section 8.2 of notice
of a Recoverable Loss or the commencement of any Proceeding with respect to
which it believes it is entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall, if a claim in respect thereto is to be made against
the Indemnifying Party under this Article, notify the Indemnifying Party in
writing of the commencement thereof; provided, however, that the omission to
notify the Indemnifying Party shall not relieve it from any liability that it
may have to the Indemnified Party to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
is not prejudiced by such omission.   (b) Settlement; Compromise. An
Indemnifying Party will not, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle
or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
pending or threatened Proceeding unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Proceeding. An Indemnified Party will not,
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any
pending or threatened Proceeding.   (c) Procedure. If a Proceeding shall be
brought against an Indemnified Party and it shall notify the Indemnifying
Party thereof in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section 8.3, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume the legal defense thereof. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such
action and participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party unless (i) the
employment of such counsel shall have been specifically authorized in writing
by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall have failed to
assume the defense of such action or (iii) the named parties to any such
Proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnified Party shall have been
advised by such counsel that there is a conflict for counsel in representing
both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party. In any such case, the
Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one action or separate
but substantially similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising
out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be liable for the fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) for the Indemnified Party. Except as aforesaid, after notice
from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its election to
assume the defense of such claim or such action, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party under this Section for any attorneys\'
fees or other expenses (except reasonable costs of investigation)
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. To the extent of any inconsistency between the provisions of this
Section 8.3(c) and Section 6.2(c), the provisions of Section 6.2(c) shall
control.    54    (d) Resolution of Disputes. In the case of an alleged
Recoverable Loss which is disputed by the Indemnifying Party, the Parties
shall attempt in good faith to resolve their differences for a period of 60
days and, if the Parties are unable to resolve their differences within such
period, the Indemnified Party or Parties may submit the matter to judicial
proceedings (unless an alternate dispute resolution procedure is specified in
this Agreement).   8.4 Consequential Damages. Neither Party shall be liable
to any other Party for claims for punitive, special, exemplary or
consequential damages, including damages for loss of profits, loss of use or
revenue or losses by reason of cost of capital, arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, regardless of whether
a claim is based on contract, tort (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), strict liability,
violation of any applicable deceptive trade practices act or similar Law or
any other legal or equitable principle, and each Party releases the other
from liability for any such damages. No Party shall be entitled to rescission
of this Agreement as a result of breach of any other Party\'s
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements, or for any other
matter.   8.5 Sole Remedy. Except as provided in Section 6.1(c), from and
after the Closing the provisions of this Article VIII shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of each Party for (i) any breach of a Party\'s
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach of
a Party\'s covenants or other agreements contained in this Agreement, or
(iii) any other matters relating to this Agreement other than claims for
fraud. The Buyer and USF and their respective Related Parties are the only
Persons entitled to exercise any remedy provided by this Article VIII.  
ARTICLE IX   MISCELLANEOUS   9.1 Books and Records. (a) From and after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Members to maintain copies of all books
and records in the possession of the Members at the time of the Closing and
shall prevent the Members from destroying any of such books and records for a
period of five (5) years following the Closing Date or such longer period as
may be required by applicable law without first allowing USF, at USF\'s
expense, to make copies of the same. During that period, Buyer shall cause
the Members (i) to grant to USF and its representatives reasonable
cooperation, access and staff assistance at all reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice to all of such books and records relating to the period
prior to the Closing (including workpapers and correspondence with taxing
authorities) that are not otherwise protected by legal privilege, (ii) to
afford USF and its representatives the right, at USF\'s expense, to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, and (iii) to have access to
the employees of the Members, all to the extent reasonably necessary for the
preparation of Tax Returns and the handling of Tax audits, disputes and
litigation; provided, however, that such requested cooperation, access and
assistance shall not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of
Buyer or the Members.    55    (b) Litigation Assistance. Each of USF
and Buyer shall, upon request by the other Party, use all commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the requesting Party in the evaluation, defense
or resolution of any litigation or other claim (other than litigation or
claims relating to this Agreement brought by a Member or the parties to this
Agreement) concerning the Group or any Member that exists as of the Closing
or is initiated after the Closing and is based on events occurring prior to
the Closing (including making available all personnel (including directors,
officers and employees) whose assistance or testimony is necessary to assist
the requesting Party in the evaluation, defense or resolution of such
litigation or claim and making available for review and copying copies of all
books and records and other reasonably requested information (including
financial information) to the extent reasonably relevant to such litigation
or claim and to the extent not protected by legal privilege, not
competitively sensitive and not proprietary in nature. The requesting
Party shall reimburse the other Party for all reasonable expenses of such
Party or such Party\'s personnel related to providing such assistance.  
9.2 Further Assurances. USF shall, at any time and from time to time on and
after the Closing Date, upon request by Buyer and without
further consideration, take or cause to be taken such actions and execute,
acknowledge and deliver, or cause to be executed, acknowledged and delivered,
such instruments, documents, transfers and conveyances as may be required for
the better conveying, transferring, assigning and delivering of the USFCA
Shares to Buyer.   9.3 Notices. All notices and other communications given

This Agreement and all the rights and powers granted hereby shall bind and
inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns. This Agreement and the rights, interests and obligations
hereunder may not be assigned by either Party without the written consent of
the other Party.   (b) Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to its conflict of laws doctrines, except that for purposes of
determining compliance with or the existence of liabilities under
Environmental Laws, the Environmental Laws of the Governmental Body with
jurisdiction over the real property, personal property, facility or activity
involved shall govern.   (c) Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process.
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably acknowledges and consents that any
legal action or proceeding brought with respect to any of the obligations
arising under or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the courts of
the State of Delaware, or if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, as the Party
bringing such action or proceeding may elect, and each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably submits to and accepts with regard to any such action or
proceeding, for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, the jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts. Each Party hereby
further irrevocably waives any claim that any such courts lack jurisdiction
over such Party, and agrees not to plead or claim, in any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby brought in any of the aforesaid courts, that any such court lacks
jurisdiction over such Party. Each Party irrevocably consents to the service
of process in any such action or proceeding by the mailing of copies thereof
by registered or certified mail, postage prepaid, to such Party, at its
address for notices set forth in Section 9.3 of this Agreement, such service
to become effective ten (10) days after such mailing. Each Party hereby
irrevocably waives any objection to such service of process and further
irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any action
or proceeding commenced hereunder or under any other documents contemplated
hereby that service of process was in any way invalid or ineffective. Subject
to Section 9.4(d) of this Agreement, the foregoing shall not limit the rights
of either Party to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
The foregoing consents to jurisdiction shall not constitute general consents
to service of process for any purpose except as provided above and shall not
be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the Parties to this
Agreement.   (d) Waivers. Each of the Parties hereby waives any right it
may have under the laws of any jurisdiction to commence by publication any
legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement. To the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, each of the Parties hereby irrevocably
waives the objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement in any of the courts referred to in Section 9.4(c) of this
Agreement and hereby further irrevocably waives and agrees not to plead or
claim that any such court is not a convenient forum for any such suit, action
or proceeding.   (e) Enforcement. The Parties agree that any judgment
obtained by either Party or its permitted successors or assigns in any
action, suit or proceeding referred to above may, in the discretion of such
Party (or its permitted successors or assigns), be enforced in any
jurisdiction, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.    58    (f)
Deemed Acceptance. Each Related Party of Buyer or USF, as the case may be,
seeking the benefit of Article VIII of this Agreement shall be deemed to have
accepted and agreed to the provisions of this Section 9.4 as a condition to
obtaining any benefits under Article VIII as if such Person was one of the
Parties named herein.   9.5 Amendment and Waiver; Cumulative Effect. To be
effective, any amendment or waiver under this Agreement must be in writing
and be signed by the Party against whom enforcement of the same is sought.
Neither the failure of either Party to exercise any right, power or remedy
provided under this Agreement or to insist upon compliance by the other Party
with its obligations hereunder, nor any custom or practice of the Parties at
variance with the terms hereof shall constitute a waiver by such Party of its
right to exercise any such right, power or remedy or to demand such
compliance. The rights and remedies of the Parties are cumulative and not
exclusive of the rights and remedies that they otherwise might have now or
hereafter, at law, in equity, by statute or otherwise.   9.6 Entire
Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement, the confidentiality
agreement entered into by the Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, and the Schedules set forth all of the promises,
covenants, agreements, conditions and undertakings between the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior
or contemporaneous agreements and understandings, negotiations, inducements
or conditions, express or implied, oral or written. This Agreement is not
intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or
remedies hereunder, except the provisions of Article VIII to the extent they
relate to Related Parties of USF or the Buyer.   9.7 Severability. If any
term or other provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any
rule of Law in any particular respect or under any particular circumstances,
such term or provision shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect in
all other respects and under all other circumstances, and all other terms,
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to either Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are
fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.   9.8 Counterparts. This
Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original but all of which together shall be deemed one and the same
instrument.   [REMAINDER OF PAGE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK]
