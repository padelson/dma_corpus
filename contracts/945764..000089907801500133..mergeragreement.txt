                 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION


     THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER AND  REORGANIZATION,  dated as of June 4,

holders of the shares of issued and  outstanding  common  stock of Matrix  ("the
Matrix  Common  Shareholders")  and issued and  outstanding  preferred  stock of
Matrix ("the Matrix  Preferred  Shareholders")  set forth on the signature  page
hereto  as of the date  opposite  each  signature  thereon.  The  Matrix  Common
Shareholders  and  the  Matrix  Preferred   Shareholders  will  be  referred  to
collectively as the "Matrix Shareholders."

     WHEREAS,  Matrix,  upon the terms and  subject  to the  conditions  of this
Agreement and in  accordance  with the General  Corporation  Law of the State of
Delaware  ("DGCL") and the Louisiana  Business  Corporation  Law ("LBCL"),  will
merge with and into Merger Sub (the "Merger");

     WHEREAS,  the Matrix Board of Directors  and the Matrix  Shareholders  have
determined  that  the  Merger  is  advisable  and is fair  to,  and in the  best
interests  of, Matrix and its  shareholders,  and have approved and adopted this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;

     WHEREAS,  the Board of Directors of Denbury has determined  that the Merger
is  advisable  and is fair to, and in the best  interests  of,  Denbury  and its
stockholders,  and has approved and adopted this Agreement and the  transactions
contemplated hereby;

     WHEREAS,  for federal  income tax purposes,  it is intended that the Merger
will  qualify as a tax-free  reorganization  under the  provisions  of  Sections

"Code"),  and it is also  intended  that the Merger will be  accounted  for as a
purchase;

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  foregoing  and the  respective
representations,   warranties,  covenants  and  agreements  set  forth  in  this
Agreement, the parties hereto agree as follows:


                                    ARTICLE I

Day after Denbury's receipt of the Cure Notice (as defined in Section 7.13(b) of
this Agreement),  or (b) at such other time, date or place as Denbury and Matrix

the "Closing Date." Promptly after Denbury's receipt of the Cure Notice, each of
the  parties  will  give  to the  other  written  notice  of the  covenants  and

Sub immediately  prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers

               CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

     Section  2.01.  Merger   Consideration;   Conversion  and  Cancellation  of
Securities.  At the  Effective  Time,  by virtue of the Merger and  without  any
action on the part of Denbury, Matrix or the Matrix Shareholders:

          (a) Subject to the other  provisions of this Article II, each share of
     common stock,  no par value,  of Matrix  ("Matrix Common Stock") issued and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be exchanged for:

               (i) $14.098 or approximately  $30,395,288 in the aggregate, to be
          paid by Denbury or the Merger  Sub in cash,  provided,  however,  that
          $1.1596 per share of Matrix Common Stock shall be held back by Denbury
          and  deposited  in escrow  pursuant  to Section  2.01(d) to secure the
          indemnity obligations of the Matrix Common Shareholders; and

               (ii) a number of shares of Denbury Common Stock (the  "Conversion
          Ratio"),  determined  by  dividing  the Total  Stock Pool (as  defined
          below) by 2,156,000, representing the number of issued and outstanding
          shares of Matrix Common Stock on the Closing Date.  "Total Stock Pool"
          means  5,660,000  shares of Denbury Common Stock,  provided,  however,
          that if the Denbury  Share Value is less than  $11.00,  then the Total
          Stock Pool shall be the  lesser  of: (i)  7,782,500  shares of Denbury
          Common  Stock,  or (ii) the number of shares of Denbury  Common  Stock
          determined by dividing  $62,260,000  by the Denbury  Share Value,  and
          further  provided that if the Denbury Share Value is more than $13.00,
          then the Total  Stock  Pool  shall be the  number of shares of Denbury
          Common Stock  determined by dividing  $73,580,000 by the Denbury Share
          Value.

          (b) At the Effective Time, each issued and outstanding share of Series
     A 10%  Cumulative  Redeemable  Preferred  Stock,  no par  value,  of Matrix
     ("Matrix  Preferred  Stock"),  shall be exchanged  for the $10.00 per share
     Stated Value of such Matrix Preferred Stock, which is to be paid by Denbury
     or the Merger  Sub in cash,  or  $30,819,210  in the  aggregate,  plus cash
     dividends  payable  at the rate of 10% per  annum on the  Matrix  Preferred
     Stock from January 1, 2001 to the Closing Date.

          (c) As a result of their  conversion  pursuant to Sections 2.01(a) and
     (b) all issued and  outstanding  shares of Matrix  Common  Stock and Matrix
     Preferred  Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall  automatically  be
     canceled and retired. Each certificate  previously evidencing Matrix Common
     Stock  outstanding  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time  ("Converted
     Matrix Common Stock") shall thereafter  represent the right to receive that
     number  of  shares of  Denbury  Common  Stock  determined  pursuant  to the
     Conversion  Ratio  and the  right  to  receive  cash  pursuant  to  Section
     2.01(a)(i) of this Agreement. Each certificate previously evidencing Matrix
     Preferred  Stock  outstanding  immediately  prior  to  the  Effective  Time
     ("Converted  Matrix Preferred Stock") shall thereafter  represent the right
     to  receive  cash  pursuant  to  Section  2.01(b)  of this  Agreement.  The



                                        3

     consideration  to be paid  pursuant  to  Sections  2.01(a) and (b) shall be
     referred to as the  "Merger  Consideration."  At the  Effective  Time,  the
     holders of certificates previously evidencing Converted Matrix Common Stock
     and Converted  Matrix  Preferred  Stock shall cease to have any rights with
     respect  to  such  Converted  Matrix  Common  Stock  and  Converted  Matrix
     Preferred  Stock  except  the right to  receive  the  Merger  Consideration
     applicable  thereto  and as  otherwise  provided  herein  or by  law.  Such
     certificates  previously  evidencing Converted Matrix Common Stock shall be
     exchanged for certificates  evidencing whole shares of Denbury Common Stock
     issued in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such certificates to
     Denbury.  No fractional shares of Denbury Common Stock shall be issued and,
     in lieu  thereof,  a cash payment shall be made pursuant to Section 2.02 of
     this Agreement.

          (d) In order to secure the  indemnification  obligations of the Matrix
     Common  Shareholders  under  Article VIII,  and without  limiting any other
     rights that  Denbury  may have  pursuant to this  Agreement  or  otherwise,
     Denbury  shall  withhold at the Closing Date from the Merger  Consideration
     payable to the Matrix Common Shareholders pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) an
     aggregate cash amount of $2,500,000,  or approximately $1.1596 per share of
     Matrix  Common  Stock (the  "Holdback"),  which amount shall be paid at the
     Closing to a third  party  escrow  agent  reasonably  satisfactory  to both
     Denbury and the Matrix Common Shareholders (the "Escrow Agent") pursuant to
     an escrow  agreement  in a form  reasonably  satisfactory  to Denbury,  the
     Matrix Common Shareholders, and the Escrow Agent. The Holdback will be held
     by the  Escrow  Agent for a period of one (1) year from the  Closing  Date,
     plus such additional  period as necessary for all claims made by Denbury in
     accordance  with this Agreement  during such one-year period to be resolved
     (the "Holdback  Period") in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
     escrow agreement which shall include the following:

               (i) Denbury may  withdraw  all or any portion of the  Holdback to
          pay or to  provide  for the  payment  of any  liability  of the Matrix
          Common  Shareholders  arising  under Section 8.02 upon giving not less
          than 30 days prior written notice to the Matrix Common Shareholders of
          such  liability  and the  intent to  withdraw  all or a portion of the
          Holdback  to apply  thereto,  unless  the Matrix  Common  Shareholders
          object to such payment by written notice to Denbury delivered at least
          15 days prior to the date proposed for withdrawal of such Holdback;

               (ii) If the Matrix Common Shareholders timely object to a payment
          out of the Holdback  under  Section  2.01(d)(i),  any dispute shall be
          resolved  by dispute  resolution  as set forth in Section  11.12.  Any
          funds  to which  Denbury  is  entitled  as a  result  of such  dispute
          resolution shall be paid out of the Holdback.  The remaining  Holdback
          funds  shall  remain on  deposit  with the  Escrow  Agent and shall be
          subject to the provisions of Section  2.01(d)(i)  until the expiration
          of the Holdback Period; and

               (iii)  The  amount,  if any,  of the  Holdback  remaining  at the
          expiration  of the  Holdback  Period  shall be disbursed to the Matrix
          Common  Shareholders  proportionately  according  to their  respective
          ownership  of  the  Matrix  Common  Stock  immediately  prior  to  the




                                        4

<PAGE>



          Effective  Time.  In  addition,  Denbury  shall pay the Matrix  Common
          Shareholders  interest on the amount of the Holdback  paid pursuant to
          the  provisions  of this  Section  2.01(d)(iii)  to the Matrix  Common
          Shareholders,  which  interest  shall  be in an  amount  equal  to the
          interest earned during the period on such amount held in Escrow.

          The Holdback shall not be considered an advance  payment of any amount
          due to Denbury or as a measure of or limitation  on Denbury's  damages
          in case of any  breach by the  Matrix  Common  Shareholders  of any of
          their   representations,   warranties,   indemnities,   covenants   or
          agreements contained in this Agreement. The provisions of this Section
          2.01(d) are in addition to, and not in  substitution or replacement of
          the provisions of Section 7.13(d).

               (iv) For income tax purposes, Denbury shall include in its income
          any  interest  earned on the  Holdback  prior to  disbursement  to the
          Matrix Common Shareholders.

          (e)  Each  share  of  common  stock  of  the  Merger  Sub  issued  and
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain issued and
     outstanding and shall  thereafter  represent one (1) validly issued,  fully
     paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving  Corporation,
     and shall not be converted or affected by virtue of the Merger.

     Section 2.02. No Fractional  Shares.  No certificates  or scrip  evidencing
fractional shares of Denbury Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for
exchange of certificates,  and such fractional share interests shall not entitle
the owner thereof to any rights of a stockholder of Denbury. In lieu of any such
fractional shares, (i) each holder of a certificate previously evidencing Matrix
Common Stock,  upon surrender of such certificate for exchange  pursuant to this
Article II, shall be paid an amount in cash (without  interest),  rounded to the
nearest cent, determined by multiplying (A) the Closing Price for Denbury Common
Stock by (B) the fractional interest of a share of Denbury Common Stock to which
such holder would otherwise be entitled (after the exchange into whole shares of
the shares of Matrix Common Stock held of record by such holder at the Effective
Time).  "Closing Price" means the closing sales price of Denbury Common Stock on
the New York Stock  Exchange  ("NYSE") as reported by the Wall Street Journal on
the day preceding the Effective Time.

     Section  2.03.  Withholding.  Denbury (or any Affiliate  thereof)  shall be
entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from the  consideration  otherwise  payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any former holder of Converted Matrix Common Stock
or Converted  Matrix  Preferred  Stock such amounts as Denbury (or any Affiliate
thereof) is required to deduct and  withhold  with respect to the making of such
payment  under the Code or any  other  provision  of  federal,  state,  local or
foreign tax law  (including  but not limited to the Foreign  Investment  in Real
Property  Tax Act) and Denbury  agrees to remit to the proper  taxing  authority
such amounts so withheld. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Denbury,
such  withheld  amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of this  Agreement as
having been paid to the former  holder of the  Converted  Matrix Common Stock or
Converted  Matrix  Preferred  Stock in  respect  of  which  such  deduction  and
withholding  was made by  Denbury.  Without  in any way  limiting  the prior two
sentences of this Section  2.03,  Denbury (or any  Affiliate  thereof)  shall be
entitled  to  deduct  and  withhold  from the  consideration  otherwise  payable



                                        5

<PAGE>



pursuant  to this  Agreement  any amounts  required  to be  withheld  under Code
Section 1445. Each Matrix  Shareholder that is not subject to withholding  under
Code Section 1445 agrees to provide  Denbury,  on or prior to the Closing  Date,
with an affidavit stating,  under penalties of perjury, the Matrix Shareholder's
United States taxpayer identification number and that such Matrix Shareholder is
not a foreign person pursuant to section 1445(b)(2) of the Code.

     Section  2.04.  Distributions  with  Respect to Denbury  Common  Stock.  No
dividends or other distributions  declared or made after the Effective Time with
respect to Denbury  Common  Stock with a record  date after the  Effective  Time
shall  be  paid  to the  holder  of  any  unsurrendered  certificate  previously
representing shares of Matrix Common Stock, and no Merger Consideration shall be
paid to any such holders until the holder of such  certificate  shall  surrender
such certificate theretofore representing shares of Matrix Common Stock. Subject
to applicable laws, following surrender of any such certificate,  there shall be
paid to the holder of the certificates evidencing whole shares of Denbury Common
Stock issued in exchange therefor,  without interest, (i) promptly following the
surrender of such certificate  representing  Matrix Common Stock and in addition
to the amount of any cash  payable  with  respect  to the  portion of the Merger
Consideration  to be paid in cash or for a  fractional  share of Denbury  Common
Stock  to which  such  holder  is  entitled  pursuant  to  Section  2.02 of this
Agreement, the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record
date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Denbury Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate  payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after the Effective
Time but prior to a payment  date with  respect to such whole  shares of Denbury
Common Stock.

     Section  2.05.  Stock  Transfer  Books.  At the Effective  Time,  the stock
transfer  books of  Matrix  shall  be  closed  and  there  shall  be no  further
registration  of transfers of shares of Matrix  Common Stock  thereafter  on the
records of Matrix.  If, after the Effective Time,  certificates are presented to
the Surviving  Corporation,  they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration,  deliverable  in respect  thereof  pursuant to this  Agreement in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II.

                                   ARTICLE III
                    REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MATRIX
                       AND THE MATRIX COMMON SHAREHOLDERS

     Matrix and the Matrix Common  Shareholders  hereby severally  represent and
warrant to Denbury and Merger Sub that:

     Section 3.01.  Organization and  Qualification;  Subsidiaries.  Matrix is a
corporation,  and each of  Matrix's  Subsidiaries  (as such term is  defined  in
Section 11.02) is a corporation,  limited liability company or partnership, duly
organized,  validly existing and in good standing (if applicable) under the laws
of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, and each of Matrix and
its Subsidiaries has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to conduct its business as it is now being conducted,  and is
qualified to do business and is in good standing in each  jurisdiction  in which
the nature of the business  conducted  by it or the  ownership or leasing of its
properties makes such qualification  necessary,  other than where the failure to
be so qualified and in good  standing does not have, or could not  reasonably be




                                        6

<PAGE>



expected to have, a material  adverse effect.  The term "material" or variations
thereof as used in this Agreement to qualify a representation and warranty shall
mean,  with respect to such  representation  and warranty,  that the effect of a
breach  thereof is that,  or the cause of a  representation  and warranty  being
breached  is that (i) the value of an asset or the  amount  of a  benefit  is or
could be diminished by more than  $250,000,  or is or could be at least $250,000
less  than  represented,  or (ii) a  liability  or  obligation  is or  could  be
incurred,  or an expenditure is or could be required,  in an amount that is more
than  $250,000,  or in an amount that is or could be at least $250,000 more than
represented.  No representations  and warranties shall be deemed to be qualified
by the term "material" or variations  thereof if as a result of  representations
and  warranties  being so qualified the aggregate sum of (i) the amount by which
the value of assets or the amount of benefits are or could be  diminished or are
or could be less than  represented,  plus  (ii) the  amount  of  liabilities  or
obligations that are or could be incurred,  or expenditures that are or could be
required,  or that are or could be in an amount  that is more than  represented,
exceeds $1,500,000. The term material or variations thereof as used elsewhere in
this Agreement,  shall have a meaning  consistent with the context of its usage.
Section  3.01 of the  Disclosure  Schedule  delivered  by Matrix  and the Matrix
Common  Shareholders  to Denbury and Merger Sub prior to the  execution  of this
Agreement (the "Matrix Disclosure  Schedule") will set forth a true and complete
list of all the directly or  indirectly  owned  Subsidiaries,  together with the
jurisdiction  of  incorporation  or organization of each such Subsidiary and the
percentage of each such Subsidiary's  outstanding  capital stock or other equity
interests owned by Matrix or one of its Subsidiaries.

     Section 3.02.  Articles of Incorporation  and Bylaws.  Matrix has furnished
and made  available  to Denbury,  and there is  attached to Section  3.02 of the
Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  complete  and correct  copies of the  Articles of
Incorporation and the Bylaws or the equivalent organizational documents, in each
case as amended or restated  through the date hereof,  of Matrix and each of its
Subsidiaries.  Neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
of the  provisions  of its Articles of  Incorporation  or Bylaws (or  equivalent
organizational documents).

     Section 3.03. Capitalization.

          (a) The  authorized  capital  stock of Matrix  consists of  10,000,000
     shares of Matrix  Common  Stock,  no par  value  and  10,000,000  shares of
     preferred stock, no par value,  4,000,000 of which have been designated the
     Matrix  Preferred  Stock.  At the date hereof,  2,156,000  shares of Matrix
     Common Stock were issued and  outstanding  and held of record by the Matrix
     Common  Shareholders;  no shares of Matrix Common Stock were held by Matrix
     in its  treasury;  380,469  shares of Matrix Common Stock were reserved for
     issuance upon exercise of stock options heretofore granted or available for
     grant pursuant to the Matrix Oil & Gas Inc. 2000  Long-Term  Incentive Plan
     (the  "Matrix  Option  Plan"),  with  options to  purchase  380,469  shares
     outstanding as of the date hereof;  and 3,081,921 shares of Preferred Stock
     were  issued and  outstanding  and held of record by the  Matrix  Preferred
     Shareholders.  No other  shares of  capital  stock of Matrix are issued and
     outstanding or reserved for issuance or required to be issued for any other
     purpose.  Each of the issued  shares of capital stock of each of Matrix and
     its  Subsidiaries  is duly  authorized,  validly  issued and fully paid and
     nonassessable,  and has not been issued in violation of (nor are any of the
     authorized shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, Matrix
     or any of its  Subsidiaries  subject to) any  preemptive or similar  rights




                                        7

<PAGE>



created by statute,  the Articles of  Incorporation or Bylaws (or the equivalent
organizational documents) of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries, any agreement to
which  Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries  is a party or is bound or  applicable
federal or state securities  laws. No Matrix  Shareholder is entitled to receive
any  dividend or other  distribution  in  connection  with any shares of capital
stock of Matrix  except for  dividends  accrued  on the  Preferred  Stock  since
January 1,  2001.  All  issued  shares or other  equity  interests  in  Matrix's
Subsidiaries  are owned by Matrix or a Subsidiary  of Matrix,  free and clear of
all security  interests,  liens,  claims,  pledges,  agreements,  limitations on
Matrix's or such Subsidiaries'  voting rights,  charges or other encumbrances of
any nature whatsoever.

          (b) No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Matrix or its
     Subsidiaries  having the right to vote (or convertible into or exchangeable
     or exercisable  for securities  having the right to vote) on any matters on
     which   stockholders   may  vote  ("Matrix  Voting  Debt")  are  issued  or
     outstanding.

          (c) Except  pursuant to the Matrix Option Plan,  there are no options,
     warrants  or other  rights  (including  registration  rights),  agreements,
     arrangements  or commitments of any character to which Matrix or any of its
     Subsidiaries is a party relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of
     Matrix  or any of  its  Subsidiaries  or  obligating  Matrix  or any of its
     Subsidiaries  to grant,  issue,  sell or  register  under  federal or state
     securities  laws any shares of capital  stock,  Matrix Voting Debt or other
     equity  interests  of Matrix  or any of its  Subsidiaries.  Except  for the
     obligation to redeem the Preferred Stock as set forth in the certificate of
     designations of the Preferred  Stock filed with the Louisiana  Secretary of
     State on March 27, 2000, there are no obligations, contingent or otherwise,
     of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries (i) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
     acquire any shares of Matrix  Common Stock or other capital stock of Matrix
     or the  capital  stock  of any of its  Subsidiaries,  or  (ii)  other  than
     advances to its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business, to provide
     funds  to,  or to make any  investment  in (in the form of a loan,  capital
     contribution or otherwise), or to provide any guarantee with respect to the
     obligations of, any of its Subsidiaries or any other person. Except for its
     Subsidiaries  listed in  Section  3.01 of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,
     neither Matrix nor any of Subsidiaries (x) directly or indirectly owns, (y)
     has agreed to  purchase or  otherwise  acquire,  or (z) holds any  interest
     convertible  into or exchangeable or exercisable  for, the capital stock or
     any other equity interests of any corporation,  partnership,  joint venture
     or  other  business  association  or  entity.   Except  for  the  Incentive
     Compensation  Agreements  listed in Section  3.15 of the Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  there are no  agreements,  arrangements  or  commitments  of any
     character  (contingent or otherwise) pursuant to which any person is or may
     be entitled to receive any payment  based on, or  calculated  in accordance
     with, the revenues or earnings of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries. Except
     for the Common  Shareholders  Agreement  by and among  Matrix  and  certain
     Matrix Shareholders dated as of March 27, 2000, there are no voting trusts,
     proxies or other agreements or understandings to which Matrix or any of its
     Subsidiaries  is a party or by which Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries  is
     bound with  respect  to the voting of any shares of capital  stock or other
     equity interests of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (d) Section  3.03(d) of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule  sets forth a
     complete and correct list as of the date hereof of the number of options to
     purchase  Matrix Common Stock  outstanding  under Matrix Option Plans,  the
     names and  addresses  of the  holders of each such option and the number of
     shares of Matrix Common Stock issuable thereunder and the exercise price of
     each such option.

     Section 3.04. Authority.  Each of the Matrix Shareholders has all requisite
legal right, power and authority,  and Matrix has all requisite  corporate power
and authority, to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations
hereunder and to consummate the transactions  contemplated hereby. The execution
and delivery of this Agreement by Matrix and each Matrix  Shareholder that is an
entity,  and the  consummation by Matrix and each Matrix  Shareholder that is an
entity of the transactions contemplated hereby, have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate or other entity action and proceeding and no other corporate
or other  entity  actions  or  proceedings  on the part of Matrix or any  Matrix
Shareholder  are  necessary  to  authorize  the  execution  and delivery of this
Agreement or the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby.  This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Matrix Shareholders and Matrix
and,  assuming the due  authorization,  execution and delivery hereof by Denbury
and Merger  Sub,  constitutes  the legal,  valid and binding  obligation  of the
Matrix Shareholders and Matrix,  enforceable against the Matrix Shareholders and
Matrix in accordance  with its terms.  Notwithstanding  anything in this Section
3.04 to the contrary,  each Matrix Shareholder makes these  representations only
with  respect  to itself or  himself,  as  applicable,  and  Matrix and not with
respect to any other Matrix Shareholder.

     Section 3.05. No Conflict: Required Filings and Consents.

          (a) The execution  and delivery of this  Agreement by Matrix does not,
     and the  performance  by Matrix  of its  obligations  hereunder,  including
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, will not (i) conflict
     with or violate the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws,  or the equivalent
     organizational documents, in each case as amended or restated, of Matrix or
     any of its Subsidiaries,  (ii) conflict with or violate any federal, state,
     foreign or local law, statute, ordinance, rule or regulation (collectively,
     "Laws") in effect as of the date of this  Agreement or any judgment,  order
     or decree to which Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by or to
     which any of their  respective  properties  are bound or  subject  or (iii)
     except as set forth in  Section  3.05 of the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,
     result in any  breach of or  constitute  a default  (or an event  that with
     notice or lapse of time or both  would  become a default)  or  require  the
     approval  or consent of or any notice to any third party  under,  or impair
     any of Matrix's or any of its  Subsidiaries'  rights or alter the rights or
     obligations  of any third  party  under,  or give to others  any  rights of
     termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or require payment
     under,  or result in the  creation of a lien or  encumbrance  on any of the
     properties or assets of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries  pursuant to, any
     note, bond, mortgage,  indenture, lending agreement,  contract,  agreement,
     lease,  license,  permit,  franchise or other  instrument  or obligation to
     which Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by or to which Matrix
     or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties, rights in
     property, or data or information used in the conduct of business, are bound
     or subject, including but not limited to any Permit or Material Contract or
     any Matrix Basic Document (as such terms are defined in Sections 3.06, 3.16
     and 3.13(b),  respectively),  but excluding from the foregoing clause (iii)




                                        9

     any such conflicts,  violations,  breaches, defaults, approvals,  consents,
     events,  rights of termination,  amendment,  acceleration or  cancellation,
     payment  obligations,  or liens or encumbrances that individually or in the
     aggregate  could not  reasonably  be  expected  to have a material  adverse
     effect.  The Board of Directors of Matrix has and by their execution hereof
     all of Matrix Shareholders have approved the Merger, this Agreement and the
     transactions  contemplated  hereby. To the extent indicated in Section 3.05
     of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule, disclosure of any matter in Section 3.05
     of the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule  will not limit the  rights of Denbury
     arising  under  Sections  3.13,  7.13 and 7.14  below  with  respect to the
     matters disclosed.

          (b)  Except  as set forth in  Section  3.05 of the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Matrix does not,
     and the  performance  by Matrix  of its  obligations  hereunder,  including
     consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby,  will not, require
     Matrix  to  obtain  any  consent,   license,   permit,  waiver,   approval,
     authorization  or order of, or to make any filing with or notification  to,
     any governmental or regulatory authority,  federal, state, local or foreign
     (collectively,  "Governmental  Entities"),  except  (i) for (A)  applicable
     requirements,   if  any,  of  the   Securities  Act  of  1933,  as  amended
     ("Securities  Act"),  the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
     "Exchange  Act"),  and (B) state  securities  or blue sky laws  ("Blue  Sky
     Laws") (ii) the filing and recordation of appropriate  merger  documents as
     required by the DGCL and the LBCL,  (iii)  applicable  requirements  of the
     Louisiana Department of Natural Resources,  the Minerals Management Service
     of the U.S.  Department  of Interior,  and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
     which may be satisfied  without  prejudice to the Surviving  Corporation by
     notice given  subsequent to the Effective Time, and (iv) applicable  filing
     requirements to reflect the transfer of title resulting from the Merger.

     Section 3.06. Permits;  Compliance.  Except as set forth in Section 3.06 of
the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  each of Matrix and its  Subsidiaries  are in

forth  in  Section  3.06 of the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  (i) no  actions,
proceedings,  or  investigations  are  pending or, to the  knowledge  of Matrix,

respect to possible conflicts with,  defaults under or violations of (i) any Law
applicable  to  Matrix  or any of its  Subsidiaries  or by  which  any of  their
respective properties are bound or subject,  (ii) any judgment,  order or decree
applicable  to Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or (iii) any of the  Permits

held by Matrix or a  Subsidiary  of  Matrix,  that  have not been  corrected  or
resolved,  except  as  identified  in  Section  3.06  of the  Matrix  Disclosure
Schedule.

     Section 3.07. Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities.

          (a) Matrix has  heretofore  delivered  to Denbury  (i) a  consolidated
     balance sheet of Matrix and its Subsidiaries for the period ending December
     31,  2000,  and (ii) and the  related  consolidated  statements  of income,
     shareholders' equity and cash flows for the period ended December 31, 2000,
     together with related notes and  schedules,  certified by Arthur  Andersen,
     LLP, whose report thereon is included therewith.  Matrix has also delivered
     to Denbury (i) an unaudited  consolidated  balance  sheet of Matrix and its
     Subsidiaries  as  of  March  31,  2001,  and  (ii)  unaudited  consolidated
     statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for the three (3)
     month period ended March 31, 2001. Such audited and unaudited  consolidated
     financial  statements  (i) are in accordance  with the books and records of
     Matrix  and its  Subsidiaries  in all  material  respects  (with  the  term
     "material"  being defined for the purposes of this Section  3.07(a) as such
     term is defined under generally accepted accounting principles,  or "GAAP")
     and were  prepared in  accordance  with GAAP applied on a consistent  basis
     throughout  the periods  involved,  and (ii) fairly present in all material
     respects the consolidated financial position of Matrix and its Subsidiaries
     as of  the  respective  dates  thereof  and  the  consolidated  results  of
     operations and cash flows for the periods indicated (except, in the case of
     unaudited  consolidated  financial  statements for interim periods, for the
     absence of footnotes and subject to adjustments, consisting only of normal,
     recurring  accruals  and  adjustments,  necessary  to present  fairly  such
     results of operations and cash flows).

          (b) Except as and to the extent set forth on the consolidated  balance
     sheet of Matrix and its  Subsidiaries  as of December 31, 2000,  and except
     for matters of the type not disclosed in the financial statements of Matrix
     described  in Section  3.07(a) but which are  disclosed  elsewhere  in this
     Agreement or the Matrix Disclosure Schedule,  neither Matrix nor any of its
     Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations, whether accrued, absolute,
     secured,  unsecured,  contingent  or  otherwise  that could have a material
     adverse  effect.  Since  December 31, 2000,  neither  Matrix nor any of its
     Subsidiaries  has incurred any  liabilities  except for (i)  liabilities or
     obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business and consistent with
     past  practice,  and which are not greater than  corresponding  liabilities
     reflected on the consolidated  balance sheet of December 31, 2000, and (ii)
     current  liabilities  incurred  in  the  course  of  making  those  capital
     expenditures  set  forth  in  Section  3.13(c)  of  the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  or capital  expenditures  otherwise consented to by Denbury, and
     (iii)  professional  fees and expenses  incurred in connection with or as a
     result  of the  Merger  which  will  be  paid  by  Matrix  and  the  Matrix
     Shareholders as provided in Section 7.05.

     Section  3.08.  Absence of Certain  Changes or Events.  Since  December 31,
2000,  Matrix and its Subsidiaries  have conducted their  respective  businesses
only in the ordinary  course and in a manner  consistent  with past practice and
there has not been (a) any material damage,  destruction or loss with respect to
any  assets of Matrix  or any of its  Subsidiaries  whether  or not  covered  by
insurance,  (b) any change by Matrix or its  Subsidiaries  in their  significant
accounting  policies,  (c) except for  dividends  by a  Subsidiary  to Matrix or




                                       11

another Subsidiary,  any declaration,  setting aside or payment of any dividends
or distributions in respect of shares of Matrix Common Stock or Matrix Preferred
Stock or the shares of stock of, or other equity  interests in, any  Subsidiary,
or any redemption,  purchase or other acquisition of any of Matrix's  securities
or any of the  securities  of any  Subsidiary,  (d) any increase in the benefits
under, or the  establishment or amendment of, any bonus,  insurance,  severance,
deferred compensation,  pension, retirement,  profit sharing, performance awards
(including,  without  limitation,  the granting of stock appreciation  rights or
restricted stock awards),  stock purchase or other employee benefit plan, or any
increase  in  the  compensation  payable  or to  become  payable  to  any of the
directors or officers of Matrix or the  employees of Matrix or its  Subsidiaries
as a group,  except for  increases  in  salaries  or wages  payable or to become
payable in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past practice, or
(e) any other  materially  adverse change or effect to the financial  condition,
results of operations, business, or prospects of Matrix or any Subsidiary, other
than as a result of  drilling  those  wells set out in the  capital  expenditure
budget contained in Section 3.13(c) of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule.

     Section 3.09.  Absence of Litigation.  Except as set forth in Section 3.09,
and in the listing of Notifications of Incidents of  Non-compliance  included in
Section 3.12(b) (the "INCs"),  of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  there is no
claim, action, suit, litigation, proceeding, arbitration or, to the knowledge of
Matrix,  investigation  of any kind, at law or in equity  (including  actions or
proceedings seeking injunctive relief),  pending or, to the knowledge of Matrix,
threatened against Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries or any properties or rights
of  Matrix  or  any of its  Subsidiaries,  and  neither  Matrix  nor  any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any continuing  order of, consent decree,  settlement
agreement or other  similar  written  agreement  with,  or, to the  knowledge of
Matrix,  continuing  investigation by, any Governmental Entity, or any judgment,
order,  writ,  injunction,  decree  or  award  of  any  Governmental  Entity  or
arbitrator,  including,  without limitation,  cease-and- desist or other orders.
Except as set forth on Section 3.09 of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  Matrix
has not incurred and will not incur any  liability or  obligation  in connection
with any matter set forth on Section 3.09 of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule that
is not  covered by  insurance  or that is in excess of the limits of  applicable
insurance.

     Section 3.10. Employee Benefit Plans; Labor Matters.

          (a) Section  3.10 of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule  describes  each
     Matrix Benefit Plan which either Matrix, any Subsidiary or any other entity
     that, together with Matrix or such Subsidiary, would be treated as a single
     employer  under  Code  Section  414  ("ERISA   Affiliate")  has  sponsored,
     maintained,  contributed  to, or to which such  entities has or has had any
     obligation or any liability of any nature (whether contingent or otherwise)
     on or before the date of Closing  for the  benefit of  employees  of either
     Matrix,  any  Subsidiary or any ERISA  Affiliate,  or with respect to which
     Matrix,  any Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate could reasonably be expected
     to incur any liability (whether contingent or otherwise).

          With respect to each Matrix  Benefit  Plan, a true and correct copy of
     (i) each  Matrix  Benefit  Plan  which has been  reduced to  writing,  (ii)
     written summaries of all unwritten Matrix Benefit Plans, (iii) each related
     trust  agreement and insurance  contract,  if any,  relating to such Matrix
     Benefit Plan, (iv) the most recent summary plan  description of each Matrix
     Benefit Plan for which a summary plan  description  is required,  including




                                       12

<PAGE>



     any  modifications  communicated  to  participants,  (v)  the  most  recent
     determination letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") and the
     full and  complete  determination  letter  application  and  correspondence
     relating to such  determination  letter  request with respect to any Matrix
     Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code
     ("Qualified  Plans"),  (vi)  Internal  Revenue  Service Forms 5500 for each
     Matrix Benefit Plan for each of the three (3) most recent plan years, (vii)
     the most recent  actuarial  report,  if any, for each Matrix  Benefit Plan,
     (viii) all contracts with third party administrators, actuaries, investment
     managers, consultants, and other independent contractors that relate to any
     Matrix Benefit Plan, (ix) all reports  prepared and distributed  within the
     four  (4)  years  preceding  the  date of this  Agreement  by  third  party
     administrators,  actuaries,  investment  managers,  consultants,  or  other
     independent  contractors  with respect to any Matrix  Benefit Plan, (x) all
     notifications  to employees of their rights under ERISA ss. 601 et seq. and
     Section  4980B of the Code  (commonly  referred  to as  "COBRA"),  (xi) all
     notices  that were  given by  Matrix,  any ERISA  Affiliate  or any  Matrix
     Benefit  Plan to the IRS or any  participant  or  beneficiary,  pursuant to
     statute,  within the four (4) years  preceding the date of this  Agreement,
     including notices that are expressly mentioned elsewhere in this Agreement,
     and (xii) all notices that were given by the IRS or the Department of Labor
     to Matrix,  any ERISA  Affiliate or any Matrix Benefit Plan within the four
     (4) years  preceding the date of this  Agreement,  will be described in, or
     attached to Section 3.10 of the Matrix Disclosure  Schedule or delivered to
     Denbury within a reasonable period of time (not less than thirty (30) days)
     before the Closing.

          (b) Each of the Matrix  Benefit Plans is in  compliance  (both in form
     and operation) and has been administered in all respects in accordance with
     its terms and with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to ERISA
     and the Code; each of Matrix,  and its Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliate has
     met its  obligations  with  respect to such Matrix  Benefit  Plans;  and no
     Matrix Benefit Plan has an accumulated or waived funding  deficiency within
     the  meaning  of  Section  412 of the Code.  Neither  Matrix nor any of its
     Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates is  contribution or has contributed to a
     "multi-employer  plan," as defined in Section  3(37) of ERISA,  and neither
     Matrix  nor any of its  Subsidiaries  or  ERISA  Affiliates  has any  past,
     present or future  obligation  or  liability  to  contribute  to any multi-
     employer  plan.  Neither  Matrix  nor  any of  its  Subsidiaries  or  ERISA
     Affiliates  has completely or partially  withdrawn from any  multi-employer
     plan with  respect to which there is any  outstanding  liability  as of the
     date of this  Agreement.  Neither Matrix nor of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA
     Affiliates  has,  directly or  indirectly,  any  liability  (including  any
     contingent  liability)  to or on  account  of a Matrix  Benefit  Plan under
     Sections  409 or 502 of ERISA or Section  4975 of the Code or  pursuant  to
     Title IV of ERISA.  As of the date of this Agreement,  no condition  exists
     that  presents  a risk  to  Matrix  or any of  its  Subsidiaries  or  ERISA
     Affiliates  of  incurring  such  a  liability.  No  proceedings  have  been
     instituted to terminate any Matrix Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV
     of ERISA and the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation is not expected to
     institute any such proceedings,  and no "reportable event," as such term in
     defined in Section  4043 of ERISA has  occurred  with respect to any Matrix
     Benefit Plan.

          (c) The  current  value of the  assets of each of the  Matrix  Benefit
     Plans, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions,  if applicable,  equals
     or exceeds the present value of the accrued benefits under each such Matrix




                                       13

<PAGE>



     Benefit Plan and all  contributions  or other amounts payable by Matrix and
     any of its  Subsidiaries  and  ERISA  Affiliates  as of the  date  of  this
     Agreement with respect to each Matrix Benefit Plan in respect of current or
     prior  plan  years has been  either  paid or  accrued  on  Matrix's  (or if
     applicable,  its ERISA  Affiliate's)  December 31, 2000 balance  sheet,  or
     accrued since December 31, 2000.  With respect to each Matrix Benefit Plan,
     there are no pending,  or, to the best  knowledge  of Matrix and any of its
     Subsidiaries and ERISA  Affiliates,  threatened or anticipated  termination
     proceedings,  investigations,  audits, suits or other claims or proceedings
     (other  than  routine  claims  for  benefits)  by, on behalf of, or against
     (directly or indirectly) any of the Matrix Benefit Plans,  Matrix or any of
     its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates or any trusts related thereto (or with
     respect to any rights or benefits thereunder).

          (d) There are no collective  bargaining or other labor union contracts
     to which Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries or ERISA  Affiliates is a party
     and no collective bargaining agreement is being negotiated by Matrix or any
     of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates.  There is no pending or, to the
     best knowledge of Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates,
     threatened labor dispute,  strike or work stoppage against Matrix or any of
     its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates.

          (e)  Except  as set forth on  Section  3.10 of the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  no Matrix Benefit Plan provides retiree medical or other retiree
     welfare  benefits and neither Matrix nor any of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA
     Affiliates  is  contractually  or otherwise  obligated,  by written or oral
     representation,  promising or guaranteeing  any employer payment or funding
     medical,  dental,  disability or other welfare  benefits upon retirement or
     termination of employment of employees  beyond that legally  required,  but
     excluding  continuation of health  coverage  required to be continued under
     Section 4980B of the Code and insurance  conversion  privileges under state
     law.  There are no  unfunded  obligations  under any  Matrix  Benefit  Plan
     providing  benefits  after  termination  of  employment  of any employee of
     Matrix  or  any  of  its  Subsidiaries  or  ERISA  Affiliates  (or  to  any
     beneficiary of any such  employee),  including but not limited to, deferred
     compensation.  No  unwritten  amendment  exists with  respect to any Matrix
     Benefit Plan.

          (f) Neither  Matrix nor any of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates
     contributes  to or has an obligation to contribute to, or has any liability
     (whether contingent or otherwise) with respect to or concerning an employee
     benefit  plan that is or was subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
     the Code.  No Matrix  Benefit  Plan has been  subject to Section 412 of the
     Code.

          (g) No transaction prohibited by ERISA and no "prohibited transaction"
     under Code  Section 4975 has  occurred  with respect to any Matrix  Benefit
     Plan. All "fiduciaries," as defined in ERISA Section 3(21), with respect to
     the Matrix  Benefit  Plans have complied in all respects with the fiduciary
     requirements and provisions of ERISA and Code Section 4975.  Neither Matrix
     nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has any liability  (whether
     contingent or otherwise) to the IRS or any governmental entity with respect
     to any Matrix Benefit Plan.




                                       14

<PAGE>



          (h)  Except as  described  on Section  3.10 of the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  each  Matrix  Benefit  Plan  provides  that it may be amended or
     terminated  at  any  time.  Further,  (i)  no  Matrix  Benefit  Plan,  plan
     documentation  or  agreement,  summary plan  description  or other  written
     communication distributed generally to employees prohibits Matrix or any of
     its  Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates from amending or terminating any such
     Matrix  Benefit  Plan;  (ii) no action or  omission of Matrix or any of its
     Subsidiaries or ERISA  Affiliates or any director,  officer,  employee,  or
     agent  thereof in any way  restricts,  impairs or prohibits  Denbury or any
     successor from amending, merging, or terminating any Matrix Benefit Plan in
     accordance  with the express terms of any such plan and applicable law; and
     (iii) each Matrix  Benefit Plan can be  terminated  within thirty (30) days
     and as of the Closing,  without  payment of any additional  contribution or
     amount and without  creating  any  unfunded or  unaccrued  liability or the
     vesting or  acceleration of any benefits  promised by such plan,  except to
     the extent  full  vesting is required  under Code  Section  411(d)(3)  with
     regard to the termination of any Qualified Plan.

          (i) The Matrix  Benefit Plan that is a Qualified Plan has an effective
     date of January 1, 1997 and shall be terminated effective as of a date that
     precedes  the  Closing   Date.   No  event  or  omission  has  occurred  or
     circumstances   exist  that  would  prevent  the  receipt  of  a  favorable
     determination  letter from the IRS in response to the submission.  No event
     or omission has occurred that would adversely  affect any Qualified  Plan's
     qualification or increase its costs.

          (j) Neither  Matrix nor any of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates
     has,  prior to the Closing  Date and in any  respect,  violated  any of the
     health care continuation  requirements of COBRA, the requirements of Family
     Medical Leave Act of 1993, ("FMLA"), if applicable, the requirements of the
     Health  Insurance   Portability  and   Accountability   Act  of  1996,  the
     requirements  of the  Women's  Health  and Cancer  Rights Act of 1998,  the
     requirements of the Newborns' and Mothers'  Health  Protection Act of 1996,
     or any  amendment to each such act, or any similar  provisions of state law
     applicable to its employees.  Matrix and each of its Subsidiaries and ERISA
     Affiliates has in all instances in the last thirty-six (36) months reserved
     the right to provide an  administrative  fee of two  percent  (2%) or fifty
     percent (50%), as applicable under COBRA.

          (k) Neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has
     nor has either  singularly or  collectively  ever had, the  obligation  to,
     maintain,   establish,  sponsor,  participate  in,  or  contribute  to  any
     International Benefit Plan.  "International Benefit Plan" means each Matrix
     Benefit  Plan that has been adopted or  maintained  by Matrix or any of its
     Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates,  whether informally or formally,  or with
     respect to which  Matrix and any of its  Subsidiaries  or ERISA  Affiliates
     will or may have any  liability,  for the benefit of employees  who perform
     services outside the United States.

          (l) Neither Matrix nor any of its Subsidiaries are or will be required
     to "gross-up" or otherwise  compensate any director,  officer,  employee or
     agent of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries because of the imposition of any
     excise  tax under  Code  Section  4999 on a  payment  made or to be made or
     allowed or which may  become due to such  person.  Except as  disclosed  in




                                       15

<PAGE>



     Section 3.10 of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  the  consummation of the
     transaction  contemplated  under  this  Agreement  will not  accelerate  or
     increase  any  liability  under  any  Matrix  Benefit  Plan  because  of an
     acceleration  or  increase  of any of  the  rights  or  benefits  to  which
     employees may be entitled thereunder.

          (m) No Matrix Benefit Plan is funded by,  associated  with, or related
     to a "voluntary employee's  beneficiary  association" within the meaning of
     Section  501(c)(9) of the Code, a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning
     of Section 419 of the Code, a "qualified  asset account" within the meaning
     of Section 419A of the Code or a "multiple  employer  welfare  arrangement"
     within the meaning of Section  3(40) of ERISA.  Benefits  under each Matrix
     Benefit Plan which is an employee welfare benefit plan are fully insured by
     an insurance  company  unrelated to Matrix and any of its  Subsidiaries  or
     ERISA  Affiliates.  No Matrix  Benefit  Plan which is an  employee  welfare
     benefit  plan is a  multi-employer  plan.  Neither  Matrix,  nor any of its
     Subsidiaries  or  ERISA   Affiliates  has  at  any  time  ever  maintained,
     established,   sponsored,   participated   in,   or   contributed   to  any
     multiple-employer  plan,  or to any plan  described  in Section  413 of the
     Code.

          (n)  Each  Matrix  Benefit  Plan  covers  only  employees,   or  their
     dependants  or  beneficiaries,  of Matrix or its  Subsidiaries  (or  former
     employees or their  dependents  or  beneficiaries,  with respect to service
     with  Matrix  and  each  of its  Subsidiaries),  so  that  the  transaction
     contemplated  by this Agreement will require no spin-off of assets or other
     division or transfer of rights with respect to any such plan.

          (o)  None  of the  assets  of any  Matrix  Benefit  Plan  include  any
     securities issued by Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates.

          (p)  Section  3.10 of the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule  sets  forth a
     reasonable  estimate  of  Matrix's  and  each of its  Subsidiary's  accrued
     liability  for  vacation,  sickness  and  disability  expenses  through and
     including the Closing Date.

          (q)  None of the  assets  of any  Matrix  Benefit  Plan is or has been
     invested  in  any  property  constituting  employer  real  property  or any
     employer security within the meaning of Section 407(d) of ERISA.

          (r) Full  payment has or will prior to the  Closing  have been made of
     all amounts which Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates is
     directly or indirectly  required,  under  applicable  law, the terms of any
     Matrix Benefit Plan or any agreement relating to any Matrix Benefit Plan to
     have paid as a contribution, premium or other remittance thereto or benefit
     thereunder.  Matrix and each of its  Subsidiaries  and ERISA Affiliates has
     made adequate  provisions for reserves or accruals in accordance  with U.S.
     GAAP to meet  contribution,  benefit or funding  obligations  arising under
     applicable  law  or the  terms  of  any  Matrix  Benefit  Plan  or  related
     agreement.  There  will be no change on or  before  the date  hereof in the
     operation of any Matrix Benefit Plan or any documents with respect  thereto
     which will result in an increase in the benefit under such plans, except as
     may be required by law.

     Governmental Authority or third party under any Environmental Law.

     would  determine  has an adverse  effect  upon the value of such  Interest,

          "Title Defect" means any encumbrance,  fact, circumstance,  occurrence

     to the extent such breach or default (whether by Matrix,  any Subsidiary or
     such a third  party)  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  ownership,
     operation,  value or use of any of the  Matrix  Properties.  Except  as set
     forth in Section 3.13(b) of the Matrix Disclosure  Statement,  all payments
     (including,  without  limitation,  all  delay  rentals,  royalties,  excess
     royalties,   minimum  royalties,   overriding  royalty  interests,  shut-in
     royalties  and valid  calls  for  payment  or  prepayment  under  operating
     agreements)  owing under the Matrix Basic Documents have been and are being
     made (timely and properly, and before the same became delinquent) by Matrix
     or a  Subsidiary  in all  respects  and, to the best of Matrix's  knowledge
     where the non-payment of same by a third party could  materially  adversely
     affect the ownership,  operation,  value or use of a Matrix Property,  have
     been and are being made by such third party in all respects. All conditions
     necessary to maintain  the Matrix  Basic  Documents in force have been duly
     performed. Except as set forth in either Exhibit B or in Section 3.13(b) of
     the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  no  non-consent  operations  exist with
     respect to any of the Matrix  Properties  that have resulted or will result
     in a temporary  or  permanent  increase or decrease in Matrix's Net Revenue
     Interest or Working Interest in such Matrix Property.

          (c) Neither Matrix nor any  Subsidiary  has incurred any expenses,  or
     made commitments to make expenditures  (capital or otherwise),  or to apply
     revenues from a Well's  production in connection with any Matrix Properties
     (and no other  obligations or liabilities  have been incurred) with respect
     to the ownership or operation of Matrix  Properties  after the date of this
     Agreement, other than expenses incurred in the normal operation of existing
     Wells on the Matrix  Properties or to continue  operations on the drilling,
     completion  or plugging of any Well or any Well  operation for which Matrix
     has  consented to  participate  and is required to continue to  participate
     pursuant to applicable agreements or to conduct emergency operations on any
     Well,  platform,  pipeline or other  production  facility,  or as otherwise
     contained in the budgeted capital expenditures set forth in Section 3.13(c)
     of the Matrix Disclosure  Schedule,  unless Denbury is given seven (7) days
     prior  written  notice  and  consents  thereto in  writing.  Subject to the
     comments  set  forth  at  Section  3.13(c)  III  of the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  all  expenses  payable  under  the  terms  of the  Matrix  Basic
     Documents  have been  properly and timely paid except for such  expenses as
     are being  currently paid prior to  delinquency  in the ordinary  course of
     business.  Except as set forth in Section 3.13(c) of the Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  no proposals  calling for  expenditures in excess of $100,000 in
     the  aggregate  are  currently  outstanding  (whether  made by Matrix,  any
     Subsidiary or by any other party) to drill additional  wells, or to deepen,
     plug back,  sidetrack,  abandon,  or rework  existing  wells, or to conduct
     other  operations  for which  consent  is  required  under  the  applicable
     operating agreement, or to conduct any other operations,  other than normal
     operation of existing wells on Matrix Properties.

          (d) No  agreements  or  arrangements  exist for the  sale,  gathering,
     transportation,  compression,  treating, processing or other marketing of a
     material volume of production from the Matrix Properties (including without
     limitation, calls on, or other rights to purchase,  production,  whether or
     not the same are currently being  exercised)  other than (i) the agreements
     set forth in Section 3.13(b) of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  and (ii)
     agreements or  arrangements  that are cancelable on thirty (30) days notice
     or less without  penalty or detriment to Matrix.  Any  agreements  or other
     arrangements under which Matrix or any Subsidiary is processing, gathering,




                                       24

<PAGE>



     transporting or otherwise  marketing,  storing or disposing of any material
     volume of oil, gas or other  minerals,  or water or  substances  associated
     therewith  (whether  or not  attributable  to Matrix  Properties),  for the
     account of a third party  include  terms that  represent  an arm's  length,
     commercially  reasonable  trade for  Matrix or any  Subsidiary.  All of the
     proceeds  from the sale of  production  from  Matrix  Properties  are being
     properly and timely paid to Matrix by the purchasers of production  without
     suspension or indemnity other than standard,  generally  accepted  division
     order indemnities.

          (e)  Except as set forth in Section  3.13(e) of the Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  neither  Matrix  nor any  Subsidiary  has  received  prepayments
     (including, but not limited to, payments for oil and gas not taken pursuant
     to  "take-or-pay"  arrangements)  for any oil or gas  produced  from Matrix
     Properties  as a result  of which  the  obligation  does (or may)  exist to
     deliver oil or gas produced from Matrix  Properties  after the date of this
     Agreement  without then  receiving  payment (or without then receiving full
     payment)  therefor or to make  repayments in cash. For each Matrix Property
     listed in Section 3.13(e) of the Matrix Disclosure  Schedule,  such section
     reflects as to each such Matrix Property (i) the total amount of prepayment
     received as of the date hereof  (and the amount of any  recoupment  thereof
     heretofore made), and (ii) whether or not a cash payment can be required in
     the event recoupment out of production  proves to be inadequate.  Except as
     set forth in Section 3.13(e) of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule, there is no
     Matrix Property with respect to which Matrix, any Subsidiary,  and/or their
     respective predecessors in title, have collectively taken more (referred to
     herein  as   "Over-produced")  or  less  (referred  to  herein  as  "Under-
     produced")  production  from such Matrix Property (or on the Units in which
     such  Matrix  Property  participates),  or any  product  thereof,  than the
     ownership of Matrix or any Subsidiary and such  predecessors in such Matrix
     Property  would  entitle  Matrix or any  Subsidiary  and such  predecessors
     (absent any balancing  agreement or arrangement) to receive,  to the extent
     such  Over-produced  or  Under-produced  position  has not,  as of the date
     hereof,  been  fully made up or  otherwise  extinguished.  For each  Matrix
     Property listed in Section 3.13(e) of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule,  such
     section  reflects,  on a well-by-well or any other basis as may be dictated
     by any applicable balancing agreement, (i) whether Matrix or any Subsidiary
     is in an Over-produced or Under-produced  position, (ii) the amount of such
     Over-production  or  Under-production,  (iii) a description  of the written
     balancing  agreement  (if any)  pertaining  to such Matrix  Property  (or a
     statement that no such agreement exists) and (iv) a statement as to whether
     royalties,  overriding  royalties or other burdens against  Matrix's or any
     Subsidiary's Net Revenue  Interest in the affected Matrix  Properties were,
     during the period the subject imbalance  accrued,  paid based upon receipts
     or  entitlements.  Except as set forth in  Section  3.13(e)  of the  Matrix
     Disclosure  Schedule,   no  pipeline  imbalances  have  arisen  and  remain
     outstanding  due to the  failure  of  nominations  made  by  Matrix  or any
     Subsidiary to match actual  deliveries  of  production  from any one (1) or
     more  Matrix  Properties.  Except as set forth on  Section  3.13(e)  of the
     Matrix Disclosure Schedule, (i) none of the purchasers under any production
     sales contracts has exercised any economic out provision;  (ii) none of the
     purchasers  under any production sales contracts has curtailed its takes of
     natural  gas  in  violation  of  such  contracts;  and  (iii)  none  of the
     purchasers  under any production  sales  contracts has given notice that it
     desires to amend the  production  sales  contracts with respect to price or
     quantity of deliveries under take-or-pay provisions or otherwise.




                                       25

          (f) To the best of Matrix's  knowledge,  no delinquent unpaid bills or
     past due charges exist for any labor and materials incurred by or on behalf
     of Matrix  instant to the  exploration,  development  or  operation  of the
     Matrix Properties.

          (g)  Except as set forth in Section  3.13(b) of the Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule, neither Matrix, any Subsidiary nor any Matrix Property is subject
     to (i) any area of mutual  interest  agreements or non-compete  agreements,
     (ii) any  farm-out or farm-in  agreement  under which any party  thereto is
     entitled to receive  assignments  of any Matrix  Property  or any  interest
     therein not yet made, or could earn  additional  assignments  of any Matrix
     Property  or any  interest  therein  after the date  hereof,  (iii) any tax
     partnership, or (iv) any agreement,  contract or commitment relating to the
     disposition  or acquisition of the assets of, or any interest in, any third
     party business entity.

          (h) All severance,  production,  ad valorem, windfall profit and other
     similar  taxes  based on or  measured  by  ownership  or  operation  of, or
     production  from,  the Matrix  Properties  have been,  and are being,  paid
     (properly and timely,  and before the same become delinquent) by Matrix and
     each Subsidiary in all respects.

          (i) The ownership and operation of the Matrix  Properties  has, to the
     extent  that   non-conformance   could  materially   adversely  affect  the
     ownership,  operation,  value or use thereof  after the date  hereof,  been
     conducted in conformity with all applicable laws, and all applicable rules,
     regulations and orders of all  governmental  agencies  having  jurisdiction
     over the Matrix Properties or Matrix or its Subsidiary.

          (j)  Except as set forth in Section  3.13(j) of the Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  there are no Preferential Rights or Consents, other than Routine
     Governmental  Approvals,  that affect any Matrix Property or Properties and
     that will be triggered by the Merger.

          (k)  Except as set forth in Section  3.13(k) of the Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  there  exist no  agreements  or other  arrangements  under which
     Matrix or any Subsidiary  undertakes to perform gathering,  transportation,
     processing  or other  marketing  services  for any third party for a fee or
     other  consideration that is now, or may hereafter be,  unrepresentative of
     commercial  rates being  received  by third  parties in  comparable,  arm's
     length transactions.

          (l) Exhibit A and/or  Exhibit B attached  hereto sets forth,  for each
     Matrix Property,  and for each currently active oil and/or gas Well drilled
     thereon,  (i) Matrix's Working Interests and Net Revenue Interests and (ii)
     the allocated  value  ("Allocated  Value") of each Matrix  Property,  which
     Allocated  Value the parties hereby agree shall be final and conclusive for
     all purposes where such term is employed in this  Agreement.  Except as set
     forth in Section 3.13(l) of the Matrix Disclosure  Schedule,  Matrix and/or
     its Subsidiaries hold Good and Defensible Title to the Matrix Properties.

          (m) Matrix has  delivered  to  Denbury a copy of the  reserve  reports
     prepared by  Netherland,  Sewell and  Associates  dated  February 27, 2001,
     Ryder Scott dated March 8, 2001,  and  Collarini  Engineering,  Inc.  dated




                                       26

<PAGE>



     January 26, 2001 (the "Reserve  Reports")  relating to Matrix's oil and gas
     reserves  (the "Oil and Gas  Reserves").  Matrix has  reviewed  the Reserve
     Reports  and has no reason to  believe  that the  Reserve  Reports  include
     misleading  information or fail to take into account information  regarding
     the  matters  reported  therein  to the  extent  any such  misstatement  or
     omission would have a material effect upon the conclusions  therein. To the
     knowledge of Matrix,  the  estimates of Oil and Gas Reserves in the Reserve
     Reports  were  prepared  in  accordance   with  standard   geological   and
     engineering  methods  generally  accepted in the oil and gas industry.  The
     estimates of the lease operating expenses,  production and ad valorem taxes
     and  capital  expenditures  and related  information  provided by Matrix to
     Netherland,  Sewell and Associates,  Ryder Scott and Collarini Engineering,
     Inc. for purposes of preparing the Reserve Reports  reasonably  reflect the
     historical  experience of Matrix,  and Matrix has no reason to believe that
     the estimates will not reflect future lease operating expenses,  production
     and  ad  valorem  taxes,  capital  expenses  or  related  information.  The
     historical factual information supplied by Matrix to Netherland, Sewell and
     Associates, Ryder Scott and Collarini Engineering,  Inc. in connection with
     the preparation of the Reserve Reports was, at the time of delivery to such
     firms, true and complete in all material respects.

          (n) No suit, action or proceeding (including,  without limitation, tax
     environmental  demands  proceedings) is pending, or to the best of Matrix's
     knowledge threatened,  which might result in material impairment or loss of
     title to any of the Matrix Properties or the material value thereof. Matrix
     shall promptly notify Denbury of any such proceedings which may arise or be
     threatened prior to the Closing hereunder.

          (o) All  proceeds  from the  sale of  hydrocarbons  produced  from the
     Matrix  proportionate  share of the Matrix  Properties are currently  being
     paid to Matrix,  and no portion of such proceeds is currently being held in
     suspense by any  purchaser  thereof or any other party by whom proceeds are
     paid except for immaterial amounts.

     Section 3.14. Real Property. Section 3.14 of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule
lists all real  property  that is owned or leased by Matrix  (other  than Matrix
Properties).

     Section  3.15.   Insider   Interests;   Transactions  with  Management  and
Employees.  No officer,  director,  or employee of Matrix or holder of more than
five percent (5%) of Matrix Common Stock currently  outstanding has any interest
in  any  property,  real  or  personal,   tangible  or  intangible,   agreement,
arrangement, or understanding, written or oral, providing for the employment of,
furnishing  of  services  by,  rental  of real or  personal  property  from,  or
otherwise requiring payments of salary, bonuses,  incentives or other amounts to
any such shareholder, officer, director or employee used in or pertaining to the
business  of Matrix  or any  Subsidiary,  except  for the  ordinary  rights of a
shareholder  or  employee   stock  option  holder  and  employment   agreements,
agreements  regarding payment of salary,  bonuses,  incentives or other amounts,
agreements regarding severance compensation,  or other agreements with employees
regarding  compensation  or other benefits that are contingent  upon a change in
control,   merger  or  similar  transaction  affecting  Matrix,  each  of  which
agreements is described in Section 3.15 of the Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule.  No
executive officer,  director or shareholder of Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries
has engaged in any  business  dealings  with Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries.
Except  as set forth in  Section  3.15 of the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  no




                                       27

<PAGE>



executive  officer or director of Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries  (except in
his capacity as such) has any direct or indirect  interest in (a) any  customer,
supplier or agent of Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries,  or (b) any person that
is a party to any contract or agreement with Matrix or any of its Subsidiaries.

     Section 3.16. Contracts and Agreements. The contracts and agreements listed
in Section 3.16 of the Matrix Disclosure  Schedule constitute all of the written
and oral contracts,  commitments, leases, bonds and other agreements (including,
without  limitation,  promissory  notes,  loan agreements,  mortgages,  deeds of
trust,  financing  statements,  and other evidences of indebtedness)  other than
Matrix Basic  Documents and the UBC Credit  Facility,  to which Matrix or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their properties are bound,  with
respect to which for each such contract the  obligations  of, or the benefits to
be  received  by,  Matrix  or any of its  Subsidiaries,  individually  or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a value in excess of $250,000 in
any consecutive 12-month period (each a "Material Contract"). Neither Matrix nor
any of its  Subsidiaries,  are and, to the best  knowledge  of Matrix,  no other
party thereto is, in material default (and no event has occurred which, with the
passage of time or the giving of notice,  or both,  would  constitute a material
default)  under  any  Material  Contract,  and  neither  Matrix  nor  any of its
Subsidiaries have waived any right under any Material  Contract.  Neither Matrix
nor any of its  Subsidiaries  have  received  any notice of material  default or
termination  under any  Material  Contract  and  neither  Matrix  nor any of its
Subsidiaries has assigned or otherwise transferred any rights under any Material
Contract.

     Section 3.17. Vote Required;  No Dissenters'  Rights. The only votes of the
holders of any class or series of Matrix capital stock  necessary to approve the
Merger and this Agreement are the affirmative votes of the holders of the issued
outstanding  shares of Matrix Common Stock and the issued and outstanding shares
of Matrix  Preferred Stock,  each voting  separately as a class, at a meeting of
the holders of the Matrix Common Stock and Matrix  Preferred Stock or by written
consent  in  lieu  of  a  meeting,  all  in  accordance  with  the  Articles  of
Incorporation  and  Bylaws  of  Matrix  and the LBCL.  Each  Matrix  Shareholder
understands and  acknowledges  that by virtue of the execution of this Agreement
and  approval of the Merger by the holders of at least eighty  percent  (80%) of
the issued and  outstanding  Matrix  Common  Stock and  Matrix  Preferred  Stock
pursuant to applicable  provisions of the LBCL,  dissenters'  rights will not be
available to the Matrix Shareholders in connection with the Merger.

     Section 3.18. Investment Representations. The following representations and
warranties  are made by each of the Matrix  Common  Shareholders  as of the date
such Matrix Common  Shareholder  becomes a party to this Agreement and only with
respect to himself or itself  and not with  respect to any other  Matrix  Common
Shareholder.

          (a) Each of the Matrix Common  Shareholders,  either alone or together
     with his or its  purchaser  representative,  as defined  in Rule  501(h) of
     Regulation D ("Regulation  D")  promulgated  under the Securities Act, (the
     "Purchaser  Representative"),   for  the  Matrix  Common  Shareholders  has
     substantial  experience  in evaluating  and investing in private  placement
     transactions  so  that  such  Matrix  Common   Shareholder  is  capable  of
     evaluating  the merits and risks of an investment in Denbury  Common Stock.
     Each of the Matrix  Common  Shareholders,  by reason of such Matrix  Common
     Shareholder's  business or financial  experience,  either alone or with the




                                       28

<PAGE>



     Purchaser  Representative,  has the capacity to protect such Matrix  Common
     Shareholder's  own  interests in  connection  with the  acquisition  of any
     Denbury  Common Stock.  Each Matrix Common  Shareholder  is an  "accredited
     investor" as defined in  Regulation  D. Such  Shareholder  or the Purchaser
     Representative  has received an offering  memorandum and a copy of the most
     recent reports filed by Denbury with the Securities and Exchange Commission
     (the "SEC") on Forms 10-K,  10-Q and any report on Form 8-K filed since the
     most recent Form 10-Q.  Such Matrix  Common  Shareholder  or the  Purchaser
     Representative  is familiar  with the  business  and  financial  condition,
     properties and operations of Denbury. Such Matrix Common Shareholder or the
     Purchaser  Representative  has also had an opportunity to discuss Denbury's
     business and financial condition,  properties and operations with Denbury's
     management. Such Matrix Common Shareholder or the Purchaser Representative,
     has also had an opportunity  to ask questions of officers of Matrix,  which
     questions were answered to such Matrix Common  Shareholder's  satisfaction.
     Such  Matrix  Common  Shareholder  understands  that  such  discussion  was
     intended to describe  certain  aspects of Denbury's  business and financial
     condition,  properties and operations, but was not a thorough or exhaustive
     description.

          (b) Each Matrix Common  Shareholder  is acquiring  the Denbury  Common
     Stock pursuant to the Merger for his own account,  for investment  purposes
     only and not with a view  toward  resale  or  redistribution.  Each  Matrix
     Common Shareholder understands that any shares of Denbury Common Stock that
     such Matrix Common  Shareholder  receives in the Merger will be "restricted
     securities"  under  the  applicable  federal  securities  laws and that the
     Securities  Act and the rules of the SEC  provide  in  substance  that such
     Matrix Common  Shareholder may dispose of any such shares of Denbury Common
     Stock  only  pursuant  to an  effective  registration  statement  under the
     Securities Act or an exemption  therefrom.  Each Matrix Common  Shareholder
     understands  that  Denbury has no  obligation  or intention to register any
     Denbury Common Stock received by such Matrix Common Shareholder as a result
     of the Merger (other than pursuant to Article VI), or to take action (other
     than  pursuant  to  Article  VI)  so as to  permit  sales  pursuant  to the
     Securities Act (including Rule 144 thereunder, which permits limited resale
     of shares purchased in a private  placement  subject to the satisfaction of
     certain  conditions,  including,  among other  things,  the  existence of a
     public market for the shares,  the  availability  of certain current public
     information  about the issuer,  the resale  occurring not less than one (1)
     year after a party has purchased and paid for the security to be sold,  the
     sale being effected  through a "broker's  transaction"  or in  transactions
     with a "market  maker," and the number of shares  being sold not  exceeding
     specified  limitations).   Accordingly,   such  Matrix  Common  Shareholder
     understands that under the rules promulgated by the SEC, such Matrix Common
     Shareholder  must dispose of any shares of Denbury Common Stock received by
     such Matrix  Common  Shareholder  in the Merger in  transactions  which are
     exempt from registration  under the Securities Act. As a consequence of all
     of the  foregoing,  such Matrix Common  Shareholder  understands  that such
     Matrix Common  Shareholder  must bear the economic  risk of any  investment
     pursuant to the Merger in Denbury Common Stock for an indefinite  period of
     time.

          (c) Each of the EnCap Shareholders, Robin R. Mingo, and Erich A. Kraus
     represents and warrants for itself or himself only, that such Matrix Common




                                       29

<PAGE>



     Shareholder  was active in the  negotiation  of the terms of the Merger and
     understands the terms of the Merger as set forth in this Agreement.

          Section 3.19. Hedging.

          (a)  Except  as set forth on  Section  3.19 to the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  neither Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries  have any outstanding
     obligations for the delivery of gas in the future on account of prepayment,
     advance  payment,  take-or-pay  or  similar  obligations  without  then  or
     thereafter being entitled to receive full value therefor.

          (b)  Except  as set forth on  Section  3.19 to the  Matrix  Disclosure
     Schedule,  neither  Matrix nor any of its  Subsidiaries  are a party to any
     futures,  hedge,  swap,  collar,  put, call,  floor,  cap,  option or other
     contract  that is  intended  to  benefit  from,  relate  to,  or  reduce or
     eliminate the risk of fluctuations in, the price of commodities,  including
     natural gas.

     Section 3.20.  Hart-Scott-Rodino  Exception.  Matrix has determined in good
faith  that the  aggregate  fair  market  value of the  assets  of  Matrix,  its
Subsidiaries  and each other  Person  that  Matrix  controls,  as defined in the
regulations under the Hart-Scott-Rodino  Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the
"HSR Act")  that are not exempt  under  Section  7A(c)(12)  of the HSR Act or 16
C.F.R.  Sections 802.3 and 802.4 (the  "Non-Exempt  Assets") is not in excess of
$50,000,000.

     Section  3.21.  Insurance.  Matrix is, and for the past three (3) years has
been, insured by insurers of recognized  financial  responsibility  against such
losses and risks and in such amounts as, to the knowledge of Matrix, are prudent
and  customary  in the  business in which Matrix is engaged and are adequate for
the claims historically made by or against Matrix; all policies of insurance and
fidelity or surety bonds insuring Matrix are in full force and effect; Matrix is
in compliance  with the terms of such policies and  instruments  in all material
respects;  there are no claims by Matrix under any such policy or  instrument as
to which any  insurance  company  is  denying  liability  or  defending  under a
reservation  of rights  clause or similar  provision;  and no such  policies are
"claims made" policies.

     Section 3.22. Business Files, Books and Records.  The business files, books
of account,  minute books,  stock record  books,  and other files and records of
Matrix and its Subsidiaries,  all of which will be made available and to Denbury
and Merger Sub for review and  copying,  are  complete and correct and have been
maintained  with sound  business  practices,  including  the  maintenance  of an

a material adverse effect.

     prepayment that exceeds,  individually or in the aggregate,  $250,000 shall
     be deemed to not be in the ordinary course of business;

          (k) take or permit any action, or fail to take any action,  that could
     prevent  the Merger  from  qualifying  as a tax-free  reorganization  under
     Section 368(a) of the Code, and Matrix will use its best efforts to prevent
     any of its officers or directors from taking or permitting any such action;

          (l) take or permit any action, or fail to take any action,  that could
     adversely affect or delay the ability of either Matrix or Denbury to obtain
     any  necessary  approvals  of any  Governmental  Entities  required for the
     transactions contemplated hereby or to perform its covenants and agreements
     under this Agreement;

          (m) waive,  compromise  or settle any material  right or claim if such
     waiver,  compromise or settlement  would adversely  affect the value,  use,
     ownership or operation of Matrix Properties;

          (n) sell,  lease,  farm-out,  transfer  or abandon  any portion of the
     Matrix Properties other than (i) items of materials,  supplies,  machinery,
     equipment,  improvements or other personal  property or fixtures  forming a
     part of the Matrix  Properties  (and then only if the same is replaced with
     an  item  of  equal  suitability  and  value  free of  liens  and  security
     interests,  which  replacement  item will then,  for the  purposes  of this
     Agreement, become part of the Matrix Properties) or (ii) production of oil,
     gas and/or  other  minerals,  or the  products  therefrom,  in the ordinary
     course of business under arrangements that do not cause the representations
     and  warranties  set forth  elsewhere  herein  to be  untrue;  or,  without
     Denbury's  consent,  release,  permit to  terminate,  modify or reduce  its
     rights under any oil, gas and/or  mineral  lease forming a material part of
     the Matrix  Properties,  or any other material Matrix Basic  Documents,  or
     enter into any new  agreements  which  would be  included  in Matrix  Basic
     Documents;

          (o) take  materially  more of the oil or gas  produced  from the wells
     located  on any  Matrix  Property  (or on units in  which  such  properties
     participate)  than their  ownership of such Matrix  Property  would entitle
     them (absent any oil or gas balancing agreement or arrangement) to take;

          (p) make any  expenditure,  whether  capital  or  other,  of more than
     $100,000,  other than (i) those set forth in Section  3.13(c) of the Matrix

     Disclosure Schedule hereto regarding the Matrix Properties,  (ii) as may be
     required to continue operations on the drilling,  completion or plugging of
     any  well  or  any  well  operation  for  which  Matrix  has  consented  to
     participate  and  is  required  to  continue  to  participate  pursuant  to
     applicable agreements or (iii) to conduct emergency operations on any well,
     platform, pipeline or other production facility;

          (q) fail to consent to any operations  involving the Matrix Properties
     that are operated by third parties;

          (r) take or fail to take any action  that  would,  or that  reasonably
     could be expected to, result in any of the  representations  and warranties
     set forth in this Agreement becoming untrue or any of the conditions to the
     Merger set forth in Section 9.01 not being satisfied. Matrix promptly shall
     advise  Denbury  orally and in writing  of any change or event  having,  or
     which,  insofar as  reasonably  can be  foreseen,  would  have,  a material
     adverse effect on Matrix; and

          (s) agree in writing or otherwise to do any of the foregoing.

     Section  5.04.  Negative  Covenants  of Denbury and Merger  Sub.  Except as
expressly contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise consented to in writing by
Matrix,  from the date of this  Agreement  until  the  Effective  Time,  neither
Denbury nor Merger Sub shall do any of the following:

          (a)  propose  to  adopt  any   amendments   to  its   Certificate   of
     Incorporation  or its Bylaws that could  reasonably be expected to delay or
     have an adverse effect on the consummation of the transactions contemplated
     by this  Agreement  or would  otherwise  be  inconsistent  in any  material
     respect  with the  terms  and  conditions  of this  Agreement  or the other
     agreements or transactions  contemplated  hereby (it being  understood that
     this  clause  (a)  shall  not in any  respect  limit the right and power of
     Denbury  to  amend  its  Certificate  of   Incorporation  to  increase  the
     authorized number of shares of any class of capital stock of Denbury);

          (b) change any of its significant accounting policies except as may be
     required by Law or generally accepted accounting principles;

          (c) take or permit any action, or fail to take any action,  that could

     any  necessary  approvals  of any  Governmental  Entities  required for the
     transactions contemplated hereby or to perform its covenants and agreements
     under this Agreement;

          (d) except as  contemplated  by this  Agreement,  issue  (whether upon
     original issue or out of treasury),  sell, grant,  award,  deliver or limit
     the voting  rights of any  shares of any class of its  capital  stock,  any
     securities  convertible  into or exercisable or  exchangeable  for any such
     shares,  or any  rights,  warrants  or options to acquire  any such  shares
     (except for the issuance of shares upon the exercise of outstanding awards,
     stock  options or warrants in  accordance  with their  terms),  or amend or
     otherwise modify in any material respect the terms of such rights, warrants
     and options; provided, however, that Denbury may issue shares of its common
     stock or options to purchase shares of its common stock, as applicable,  to




                                       39

     (i) employees  pursuant to the Denbury  Employee Stock Purchase Plan,  (ii)
     participants in the Denbury Stock Option Plan and (iii) directors  pursuant
     to the  Denbury  Director  Compensation  Plan,  or any  other  employee  or
     director compensation plan, in accordance with the respective terms of each
     of the foregoing plans or any other employee or director compensation plan;

          (e) take or fail to take any action  that  would,  or that  reasonably
     could be expected to, result in any of the  representations  and warranties
     of  Denbury  set  forth in this  Agreement  becoming  untrue  or any of the
     conditions  to the merger set forth in  Section  9.02 not being  satisfied.
     Denbury shall promptly advise the Matrix shareholders orally and in writing
     of any  change or event  having,  or which,  insofar as  reasonably  can be
     foreseen,  would have, a material  adverse  effect on Denbury or the Merger
     Sub; and

          (f) agree in writing or otherwise to do any of the foregoing.

     Section 5.05. Access and Information.

          (a) Matrix shall provide to Denbury and Denbury's officers, employees,
     accountants   and   other   agents   and   representatives    (collectively
     "Representatives"),  reasonable  access to  Matrix's  facilities,  business
     files, books and records,  and the right to make and retain copies thereof,
     and shall  cause the  Representatives  of Matrix to  cooperate  fully  with
     Denbury  and  the  Representatives  of  Denbury  in  connection  with a due
     diligence   investigation  of  Matrix  and  Matrix's  assets,   properties,
     contracts,  liabilities,  operations,  records and all other aspects of its
     business,  which Denbury shall have the right to perform  subsequent to the
     date of this  Agreement  and prior to the  Closing  Date,  and which  shall
     include but not be limited to,  surface and  subsurface  investigation  and
     testings for  conditions  that could cause a breach of the  representations
     and  warranties  set out in Section 3.13 of this  Agreement.  In connection
     with Denbury's  environmental due diligence (the  "Environmental  Review"),
     Denbury shall furnish  Matrix with an outline of the proposed  scope of the
     Environmental Review, including the locations of such activities,  provided
     that the  Environmental  Review may commence at agreed  locations  prior to
     Denbury  providing  such  outline  for all  locations.  Matrix  may  have a
     representative present to observe activities conducted on Matrix Properties
     as  part  of  the  Environmental  Review.  The  cost  and  expense  of  the
     Environmental  Review  shall be borne solely by Denbury.  No person,  other
     than  the  environmental  consultant  retained  by  Denbury  and  Denbury's
     employees may conduct the Environmental  Review.  Denbury agrees to conduct
     its Environmental Review in a manner so as not to unduly interfere with the
     business  operations of Matrix and in compliance with all applicable  Laws,
     and shall exercise due care with respect to the Matrix properties and their
     condition,  provided that Denbury shall be afforded reasonable  opportunity
     to  complete  its  Environmental  Review  prior to the Final  Notice  Date.
     Denbury shall maintain and shall cause its officers, directors,  employees,
     agents,  representatives and advisors to maintain all information  obtained
     pursuant to the  Environmental  Review strictly  confidential and shall not
     disclose  the same to any third party  (other than in  connection  with the
     provisions of Section 11.12)  without the prior written  consent of Matrix,
     except to the extent  required by  applicable  Law.  At  Matrix's  request,




                                       40

<PAGE>



     Denbury shall provide Matrix with copies of any final reports  prepared and
     analytical test results  received by Denbury promptly  following  Denbury's
     receipt of the same.

          (b)  Denbury  shall  provide  to Matrix and  Matrix's  representatives
     reasonable  access  to  Denbury's  facilities,  business  files,  books and
     records,  and the right to make and retain copies thereof,  and shall cause
     the  Representatives  of Denbury  to  cooperate  fully with  Matrix and the
     Representatives of Matrix in connection with a due diligence  investigation
     of  Denbury  and  Denbury's  assets,  properties,  contracts,  liabilities,
     operations,  records and all other  aspects of its  business,  which Matrix
     shall have the right to perform  subsequent  to the date of this  Agreement
     and prior to the Closing Date.

          (c)  No  investigation  by  the  parties  hereto  made  heretofore  or
     hereafter  shall affect the  representations  and warranties of the parties
     that are contained herein and each such  representation  and warranty shall
     survive such investigation.

     Section  5.06.   Matrix   Shareholder   Meeting.   Matrix  and  the  Matrix
Shareholders  will take all action  necessary  in  accordance  with the LBCL and
Matrix's  Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, to submit this Agreement and the
Merger for approval by the Matrix  Shareholders as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof,  and will take all reasonable  action to solicit such approval;
provided,  however,  that Denbury shall be provided an opportunity to present to
the  shareholders  a  reasonable  amount  of time  prior  to such  meeting  such
information  about  Denbury and the Merger that  Denbury in its sole  discretion
deems  necessary or  appropriate  to ensure that the  transactions  contemplated
herein comply with the  Securities  Act and applicable  state  securities  laws;
provided,  however,  that Matrix shall have a reasonable amount of time prior to
the delivery of such materials to review them. The EnCap Shareholders,  Robin R.
Mingo,  and Erich A. Kraus agree to vote their shares of Matrix Common Stock and
Matrix Preferred Stock, if any, in favor of the Merger.

     Section 5.07. Further  Assurances.  At the Closing and thereafter as may be
required, Denbury and the Merger Sub, on the one hand, and Matrix and the Matrix
Shareholders on the other hand,  shall timely execute,  acknowledge and deliver,
or cause to be executed,  acknowledged and delivered, such instruments, and take
such other action as reasonably  may be necessary or advisable,  to evidence and
effectuate the transfer of titles hereunder (including,  but not limited to, the
execution  and  delivery of  instruments  which may be  required to  effectively
transfer any interests  owned by Matrix in any state,  federal or Indian oil and
gas leases), and to carry out their respective  obligations under this Agreement
and under any documents,  certificate  or other  instrument  delivered  pursuant
hereto.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                   REGISTRATION RIGHTS OF MATRIX SHAREHOLDERS

     Section 6.01. Piggyback Registration.

          (a)  Request  for  Registration.  If during the period  ending two (2)
     years  after the  Effective  Time (but  without any  obligation  to do so),
     Denbury proposes to file a registration  statement under the Securities Act
     with  respect  to an  offering  by Denbury  for its own  account or for the
     account  of  any  holders  of  Denbury  Common  Stock  (other  than  (i)  a




                                       41

<PAGE>



     registration  statement on Form S-4 or S-8, or any substitute  form that is
     adopted by SEC; (ii) a registration  statement  filed in connection with an
     exchange  offer or  offering of  securities  solely to  Denbury's  existing
     security  holders,  or (iii) a  registration  statement  on Form S-3  filed
     pursuant to a demand by any limited partnership,  limited liability company
     or other  investment fund managed  directly or indirectly by the principals
     of TPG Advisors,  Inc., or TPG Advisors II, Inc. (the "TPG  Shareholders"),
     both Delaware corporations, (a "Piggyback Registration")),  and the form of
     registration  statement to be used permits the  registration of Registrable
     Securities,  as defined  below,  then Denbury shall give written  notice of
     such proposed filing to the Matrix Shareholders who acquired Denbury Common
     Stock  pursuant to this  Agreement and any Denbury Common Stock issued with
     respect to such Denbury Common Stock as soon as  practicable  (but not less
     than twenty  (20) days before the  anticipated  effective  date),  and such
     notice shall offer such Matrix  Shareholders  the  opportunity  to register
     their Registrable Securities as each such Matrix Shareholder may request in
     writing within ten (10) days after the date such notice is received by such
     Matrix  Shareholder  from  Denbury.  As used in this  Article  VI, the term
     "Registrable  Securities"  shall mean Denbury Common Stock at the Effective
     Time beneficially owned by any Matrix  Shareholder,  including any stock or
     other  securities  into which or for which such  Denbury  Common  Stock may
     hereafter  be  changed,  converted  or  exchanged  and any  other  stock or
     securities  issued to the  holders of such  Denbury  Common  Stock (or such
     stock or other securities into which or for which such stock is so changed,
     converted   or   exchanged)   upon   any   reclassification,   combination,
     subdivision,   dividend,   distribution   on  shares,   exchange,   merger,
     consolidation or similar transaction or event.  Subject to Section 6.01(b),
     Denbury  shall cause the managing  underwriter  of a proposed  underwritten
     offering to permit the Registrable Securities requested to be included in a
     Piggyback  Registration  to be included on the same terms and conditions as
     any similar  securities of Denbury or any other  security  holder  included
     therein  and to permit the sale or other  disposition  of such  Registrable
     Securities in accordance with the intended method of distribution  thereof.
     If any of a Matrix  Shareholder's  Registrable  Securities are accepted for
     inclusion in a Piggyback  Registration,  such Matrix  Shareholder  shall be
     required to be a party to the underwriting  agreement to which Denbury is a
     party. Any Matrix  Shareholder shall have the right to withdraw its request
     for inclusion of its Registrable  Securities in any registration  statement
     pursuant to this  Section  6.01(a) by giving  written  notice to Denbury of
     such  withdrawal  no later  than  five (5)  days  prior to the  anticipated
     effective date.  Denbury may withdraw a Piggyback  Registration at any time
     prior to the time it becomes  effective,  provided  that Denbury shall give
     prompt notice of such  withdrawal to the Matrix  Shareholders  holding such
     Registrable   Securities   requested  to  be  included  in  such  Piggyback
     Registration.

          (b)  Reduction  of  Offering.   If  the  managing  underwriter  of  an
     underwritten offering with respect to which Piggyback Registration has been
     requested as provided in Section  6.01(a) shall have informed  Denbury,  in
     writing, that in the opinion of such underwriter the total number of shares
     which  Denbury,  holders of  Registrable  Securities  and any other persons
     participating  in such  registration  intend to include in such offering is
     such as to  materially  and  adversely  affect the success of such offering
     (including  without limitation any material decrease in the proposed public
     offering price), then the number of shares to be offered for the account of
     persons  other  than  Denbury  shall  be  reduced  or  limited  (to zero if
     necessary).  In  making  such  reductions,  Denbury  will  include  in such




                                       42

<PAGE>



     underwritten  offering: (i) first, all securities Denbury proposes to sell,
     (ii) second, all securities requested to be included in the offering by TPG
     Parallel  I,  L.P.  and  TPG  Partners,   L.P.,  in  accordance   with  the
     Registration  Rights  Agreement  dated as of April 21, 1999  ("Registration
     Rights   Agreement")   by  and  among   Denbury  and  certain  of  the  TPG
     Shareholders,  (iii)  third,  to  the  extent  not  inconsistent  with  the
     Registration  Rights  Agreement,  the Registrable  Securities  owned by the
     Matrix  Shareholders  requested  to be included in the offering and Denbury
     Common  Stock  owned by holders  thereof  who have  registration  rights in
     respect  thereof pari passu with the  registration  rights granted  hereby,
     including  the Denbury  Common Stock held by TPG  Investors  II, L.P.,  TPG
     Parallel II, L.P. and TPG  Partners  II, L.P.,  and (iv) fourth,  all other
     securities of Denbury with respect to which  registration  rights have been
     granted that are inferior to those of the TPG  Shareholders  and the Matrix
     Shareholders.  To the extent the managing  underwriter's  opinion  provides
     that additional  shares,  but not all of the shares requested by the Matrix
     Shareholders and other persons who hold  registration  rights pari passu to
     those of the Matrix  Shareholders,  including TPG  Investors II, L.P.,  TPG
     Parallel  II,  L.P.  and TPG  Partners  II,  L.P.,  may be  included in the
     offering,  the number of Registrable  Securities of the Matrix Shareholders
     shall be reduced pro rata in proportion to the respective  number of shares
     requested to be registered by each such Matrix Shareholder and by any other
     persons having equal registration rights, to the extent necessary to reduce
     the total number of shares requested to be included in such offering to the
     number of shares recommended by such managing underwriter.

          (c) Limitation on Piggyback  Right.  Notwithstanding  anything in this
     Article VI to the contrary, the EnCap Shareholders and Robin R. Mingo agree
     not to effect any public  sale or  distribution  of  Denbury  Common  Stock
     during the seven (7) days prior to, and during the 90-day period  beginning
     on the  effective  date of any  registration  statement or other  qualified
     document  filed with respect to an offering of Denbury  Common Stock by the
     TPG Shareholders,  except for sales or distributions as part of an offering
     made by the Matrix Shareholders in accordance with this Article VI.

     Section 6.02. Registration Procedures.

     In  connection  with the  obligations  of  Denbury  to  effect or cause the
registration of any Registrable  Securities pursuant to the terms and conditions
of this Article VI, Denbury shall use its reasonable  business efforts to effect
the registration and sale of such Registrable  Securities in accordance with the
intended  method of  distribution  thereof  as quickly  as  practicable,  and in
connection therewith Denbury shall:

          (a)  prepare  and file with the SEC a  registration  statement  on the
     appropriate  form under the  Securities  Act, which form shall comply as to
     form in all material  respects with the requirements of the applicable form
     and  include  all  financial  statements  required  by the SEC to be  filed
     therewith,   and  use  its  reasonable   business  efforts  to  cause  such
     registration   statement  to  become  effective  and  remain  effective  in
     accordance with the provisions of this Agreement;

          (b) prepare and file with the SEC such  amendments and  supplements to
     such registration statement and the prospectus used in connection with such



                                       43

<PAGE>



     registration statement as may be necessary to comply with the provisions of
     the  Securities  Act with  respect  to the  disposition  of all  securities
     covered  by  such  registration   statement  or  to  applicable  anti-fraud
     provisions;

          (c) use its  reasonable  business  efforts to register and qualify the
     securities  covered  by  such  registration   statement  under  such  other
     applicable  securities or Blue Sky Laws, provided that Denbury shall not be
     required in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do
     business  or to file a general  consent  to  service of process in any such
     states or  jurisdictions  unless  Denbury is already  subject to service in
     such jurisdiction and except as may be required by the Securities Act;

          (d)  cause  the  Registrable  Securities  covered  by  a  registration
     statement  to be  registered  with or approved  by such other  governmental
     agencies or  authorities  as may be necessary by virtue of the business and
     operations of Denbury to enable the Holders to consummate  the  disposition
     of such Registrable Securities;

          (e)  furnish  to  the  Matrix   Shareholders   participating  in  such
     registration  and to the  underwriters of the securities  being  registered
     such  number  of  copies  of  the   registration   statement,   preliminary
     prospectus,  final  prospectus  and such  other  documents  as such  Matrix
     Shareholders or underwriters may reasonably  request in order to facilitate
     the public offering of such securities;

          (f) use its reasonable business efforts to prevent the issuance of any
     order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement,  and if one
     is issued use its reasonable  business  efforts to obtain the withdrawal of
     any order suspending the  effectiveness of a registration  statement at the
     earliest practicable moment;

          (g)  cause  the  shares of Common  Stock  included  in a  registration
     statement  to be listed on the NYSE or such other  securities  exchange  on
     which similar securities issued by Denbury are then listed;

          (h) provide a CUSIP number for all Registrable Securities covered by a
     registration   statement  not  later  than  the  effective   date  of  such
     registration statement;

          (i)  cooperate  with  each  Matrix  Shareholder  and each  underwriter
     participating  in the  disposition  of  Registrable  Securities  and  their
     respective  counsel in connection with any filings required to be made with
     the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD");

          (j)  appoint a  transfer  agent and  registrar  for all the  shares of
     Common  Stock  covered  by a  registration  statement  not  later  than the
     effective date of such registration statement; and

          (k) in connection with an underwritten offering,  participate,  to the
     extent reasonably requested by the managing underwriter for the offering or

compliance referred to in this Agreement.

     Section  6.05.  Indemnification.  The  indemnification  set  forth  in this
Section  6.05 is  independent  of, and shall not be limited or  modified  in any
respect by, Article VIII.

          (a) Denbury will  indemnify each Matrix  Shareholder,  and each person
     controlling such Matrix Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the
     Securities  Act,  with  respect  to which  registration,  qualification  or
     compliance  has been effected  pursuant to Section 6.01 of this  Agreement,
     and each  underwriter and each person who controls any  underwriter  within
     the meaning of Section 15 of the  Securities  Act,  against  all  expenses,
     claims,  losses,  damages and liabilities (or actions in respect  thereof),
     including  any of the foregoing  incurred in settlement of any  litigation,
     arising  out of or  based  on  any  untrue  statement  (or  alleged  untrue
     statement)  of a material  fact  contained in any  registration  statement,
     prospectus,  offering  circular  or other  document,  or any  amendment  or
     supplement  thereto,  incident to any such  registration,  qualification or
     compliance, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state therein
     a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary  to make the
     statements therein, not misleading,  or any violation of the Securities Act
     or any rule or regulation  promulgated  thereunder applicable to Denbury by
     Denbury  or any  person  controlling  Denbury  and  relating  to  action or
     inaction  required  of Denbury in  connection  with any such  registration,
     qualification   or   compliance,   and  will  reimburse  each  such  Matrix
     Shareholder, and each person controlling such Matrix Shareholder, each such
     underwriter  and each person who  controls  any such  underwriter,  for any




                                       45

<PAGE>



     legal  and any  other  expenses  reasonably  incurred  in  connection  with
     investigating,  preparing  or  defending  any  such  claim,  loss,  damage,
     liability or action, provided,  however, that Denbury will not be liable in
     any such case to the extent that any such claim, loss, damage, liability or
     expense  arises out of or is based on any untrue  statement  or omission or
     alleged  untrue  statement  or  omission,  made  in  reliance  upon  and in
     conformity with written  information  furnished to Denbury by an instrument
     duly executed by such Matrix  Shareholder or  underwriter  and stated to be
     specifically for use therein.

          (b) Each Matrix  Shareholder  will, if Registrable  Securities held by
     such Matrix  Shareholder  are included in the  securities  as to which such
     registration,  qualification  or  compliance is being  effected,  indemnify
     Denbury, each underwriter,  if any, of Denbury's securities covered by such
     a  registration  statement  and each  person who  controls  Denbury or such
     underwriter  within the meaning of Section 15 of the  Securities  Act,  and
     each other such Matrix Shareholder, and each person controlling such Matrix
     Shareholder within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act, against
     all  expenses,  claims,  losses,  damages  and  liabilities  (or actions in
     respect thereof),  including any of the foregoing incurred in settlement of
     any litigation, arising out of or based on any untrue statement (or alleged
     untrue  statement)  of a material fact  contained in any such  registration
     statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document, or any incident
     to  any  such  registration,  qualification  or  compliance,  amendment  or
     supplement thereof, or based on any omission (or alleged omission) to state
     therein a material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make
     the statements  therein not  misleading,  and will reimburse  Denbury,  any
     underwriters,  such other Matrix  Shareholders  and any person  controlling
     Denbury,  underwriters and any other Matrix  Shareholder within the meaning
     of Section 15 of the  Securities  Act, for any legal or any other  expenses
     reasonably  incurred in connection with investigating or defending any such
     claim, loss,  damage,  liability or action, in each case to the extent, but
     only  to  the  extent,  that  such  untrue  statement  (or  alleged  untrue
     statement) or omission (or alleged  omission) is made in such  registration
     statement, prospectus, offering circular or other document in reliance upon
     and in  conformity  with  written  information  furnished  to Denbury by an
     instrument  duly  executed  by such  Matrix  Shareholder  and  stated to be
     specifically for use therein;  provided,  however,  that the obligations of
     such  Matrix  Shareholder  hereunder  shall  not apply to  amounts  paid in
     settlement of any such claims,  losses,  damages or liabilities (or actions
     in respect  thereof) if such settlement is effected  without the consent of
     such Matrix  Shareholder  and provided  that the  obligations  of each such
     Matrix Shareholder hereunder shall be limited to an amount equal to the net
     proceeds after expenses and  commissions  to such Matrix  Shareholder  from
     Registrable Securities sold in such offering.

          (c) Each party  entitled to  indemnification  under this  Section 6.05
     (the  "Indemnified  Party")  shall  give  notice to the party  required  to
     provide  indemnification  (the  "Indemnifying  Party")  promptly after such
     Indemnified  Party has actual  knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity
     may be  sought,  and shall  permit  the  Indemnifying  Party to assume  the
     defense of any such claim or any litigation resulting  therefrom,  provided
     that counsel for the  Indemnifying  Party, who shall conduct the defense of
     such claim or litigation, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose
     approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and the Indemnified Party may
     participate in such defense at such party's  expense;  and provided further




                                       46

<PAGE>



     that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein
     shall not  relieve the  Indemnifying  Party of its  obligations  under this
     Agreement,  except  to the  extent,  but  only  to  the  extent,  that  the
     Indemnifying  Party's ability to defend against such claim or litigation is
     impaired as a result of such failure to give notice. No Indemnifying Party,
     in the  defense of any such claim or  litigation,  shall,  except  with the
     consent of each  Indemnified  Party,  consent to entry of any  judgment  or
     enter into any settlement which does not include as an  unconditional  term
     thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such  Indemnified  Party
     of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

          (d) Denbury covenants that it will timely file all reports required to
     be filed by Denbury  with the SEC under the Exchange Act in order to enable
     the Matrix  Common  Shareholders,  if they so elect,  to  utilize  Rule 144
     promulgated  under the  Securities  Act , as such rule may be amended  from
     time to time.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                              ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

     Section 7.01. Employee Matters.

          (a) Office. For a period of one (1) year following the Effective Time,
     Denbury  shall  maintain,  or shall  cause  the  Surviving  Corporation  to
     maintain, an office of the Surviving Corporation in Covington, Louisiana.

          (b) Employment;  Employee  Benefits.  The employees of Matrix prior to
     the Effective Time who are named on Exhibit 7.01(b)  attached  hereto,  are
     herein  referred to as "Matrix  Employees".  A "Good  Offer of  Employment"
     shall mean an offer of employment to commence at the Effective Time made by
     the  Surviving  Corporation  (or  Denbury  or  Merger  Sub on behalf of the
     Surviving  Corporation)  to a Matrix  Employee on terms that would not give
     rise to a right of such Matrix  Employee  to  voluntarily  terminate  their
     employment for Good Reason (as hereafter defined).  Matrix Employees who do
     not have  employment  agreements  with  Matrix  and to whom  the  Surviving
     Corporation does not make a Good Offer of Employment are herein referred to
     as  "Non-Offer  Employees."  Matrix  Employees  who do not have  employment
     agreements  with Matrix and to whom the Surviving  Corporation  does make a
     Good Offer of  Employment  are  herein  referred  to as "Offer  Employees."
     Matrix  Employees  who have  employment  agreements  with Matrix are herein
     referred to as "Contract  Employees"  and are designated as such on Exhibit
     7.01(b) attached  hereto.  With respect to each Contract  Employee,  Matrix
     shall either cause such Contract  Employee to enter into an agreement  with
     Matrix at Closing whereby their employment  agreement with Matrix,  and all
     liabilities  and  obligations of Matrix arising  thereunder,  is terminated
     effective  as of  the  Closing  Date,  or  shall  terminate  such  Contract
     Employee's  employment  agreement without cause effective as of the Closing
     Date. Contract Employees to whom the Surviving  Corporation does not make a
     Good Offer of  Employment  are herein  referred to as  "Non-Offer  Contract
     Employees." Contract Employees to whom the Surviving  Corporation does make
     a Good  Offer of  Employment  are  herein  referred  to as "Offer  Contract
     Employees." As of the Effective  Time,  Denbury  shall,  or shall cause the
     Surviving  Corporation  to,  permit  each of the Matrix  Employees  who are




                                       47

<PAGE>



     employed by the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time,
     to participate in all employee  benefit plans,  programs or arrangements of
     Denbury,  including  all bonus  plans and  employee  welfare,  benefit  and
     savings  plans,  and  vacation,  sick leave and personal  leave time plans,
     available to  employees of Denbury at the  Effective  Time,  including  the
     group health,  dental,  disability and life insurance  available to Denbury
     employees,  the Denbury Resources Inc. Stock Option Plan and Employee Stock
     Purchase  Plan and the  Denbury  401(k)  Plan,  on  terms  that are no less
     favorable than those provided to similarly situated employees of Denbury at
     the Effective Time, based on their prior service credit as further provided
     in, and subject to other terms of, Section 7.01(d).

          (c) Severance Benefits.

               (i) Denbury shall,  or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to,
          pay to  Offer  Contract  Employees  who do not  accept  the  Surviving
          Corporation's  Good Offer of  Employment,  and to  Non-Offer  Contract
          Employees,  severance  compensation  in the  amount  provided  in such
          Contract Employee's  employment  agreement plus the bonus paid to such
          Employee in January 2001. The severance  compensation paid pursuant to
          this Section  7.01(c)(i) to Offer Contract Employees who do not accept
          a Good Offer of  Employment  are  herein  called  "Contract  Severance
          Benefits".

               (ii) Denbury shall, or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation to,
          pay severance benefits to the Non-Offer Employees calculated using the
          same  formula as the formula in Section  7.01(c)(iv)  for  calculating
          severance  benefits  to be  paid to the  Offer  Employees  who  accept
          employment with the Surviving Corporation.

               (iii) There shall be no  obligation  whatsoever  to pay severance
          benefits  to  Offer  Employees  who do not  accept  a  Good  Offer  of
          Employment from the Surviving Corporation.

               (iv)  For a period  of one (1) year  after  the  Effective  Time,
          Denbury shall,  or shall cause the Surviving  Corporation  to, provide
          severance  benefits to Offer  Employees  and  Contract  Employees  who
          accept a Good Offer of Employment  from the Surviving  Corporation and
          who also within one (1) year after the  Effective  Time either (x) are
          terminated by Denbury or the Surviving  Corporation  without Cause (as
          defined in Section  7.01(c)(v))  or (y)  voluntarily  terminate  their
          employment  for Good  Reason  (as  defined  in  Section  7.01(c)(vi));
          provided,  however,  that nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
          require that Denbury or the Surviving  Corporation employ any employee
          of Matrix  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time for any specific
          period of time  after the  Effective  Time.  The Offer  Employees  and
          Contract  Employees who accept a Good Offer of Employment  may enforce
          the  obligations  of Denbury  under this Section  7.01.  The severance
          benefits  paid under this  Section  7.01(c)(iv)  shall be paid in cash
          upon termination of employment and shall be comprised of a base amount
          and an  additional  amount.  The base amount shall be equal to six (6)
          months' of the  employee's  base salary (which for part time employees




                                       48

<PAGE>



          will be salary  actually  paid and not  salary  that  would be paid if
          employment were full time) in effect at the time that their employment
          terminates  ("Current  Salary"),  plus 1/2 of the  "Bonus"  (herein so
          called) paid to such employee in January 2001. The  additional  amount
          shall be  equal  to one (1)  months'  Current  Salary  and 1/12 of the
          Bonus, for each year period of employment by Matrix, rounded up to the
          next whole year if the employee has served more than six (6) months of
          the  year of  termination  and  down  to the  last  whole  year if the
          employee  has  served  less  than  six  (6)  months  of  such  year of
          termination,  plus any  accrued  and  unused  vacation  time as of the
          Effective Time,  provided that in no event will the additional  amount
          exceed the base amount.  In addition,  the  severance  benefits  shall
          include a  reimbursement  for the cost of medical  benefits  which are
          substantially  similar to the employee's benefits immediately prior to
          the termination of their  employment,  for a period of six (6) months,
          beginning on their date of  termination.  The employee's  benefits for
          this purpose shall include  medical  benefits for the employee and any
          covered spouse or dependants.  Such reimbursement  shall take the form
          of payment of the  applicable  COBRA  premiums,  if COBRA is  properly
          elected,  or the amount of any individual policy premiums,  but not to
          exceed  the COBRA  premium  which  would have been  applicable  if the
          employee had elected COBRA coverage.

               (v)  Denbury  shall have  "Cause" to  terminate  a former  Matrix
          employee if such  employee  (x)  willfully  and  continually  fails to
          substantially  perform  his  duties  with  Denbury  or  the  Surviving
          Corporation  (other  than a  failure  resulting  from  the  employee's
          incapacity due to physical or mental illness) which failure  continues
          for a period of at least  thirty  (30) days after a written  notice of
          demand for substantial  performance has been delivered to the employee
          specifying   the   manner  in  which  the   employee   has  failed  to
          substantially  perform,  or (y) willfully  engages in conduct which is
          demonstrably  and  materially  injurious  to Denbury or the  Surviving
          Corporation,  financially  or otherwise;  provided,  however,  that no
          termination  of the  employee's  employment  shall be for Cause  until
          there shall have been  delivered  to the  employee a copy of a written
          notice specifying in detail the particulars of the employee's  conduct
          which violates either (x) or (y) above. No act, nor failure to act, on
          the employee's part, shall be considered "willful" unless he has acted
          or  failed  to act  with  an  absence  of good  faith  and  without  a
          reasonable  belief  that his  action or failure to act was in the best
          interest of Denbury or the Surviving Corporation.

               (vi)  "Good  Reason"  shall  mean  the  occurrence  of any of the
          following events or conditions:

                    x. a change in the employee's responsibilities which, in the
               employee's   reasonable   judgment,   represents  a   substantial
               reduction of the status,  title,  position or responsibilities as
               in  effect  immediately  prior  thereto;  the  assignment  to the
               employee  of  any  duties  or  responsibilities   which,  in  the
               employee's  reasonable  judgment,   are  inconsistent  with  such
               status, title, position or responsibilities;  notwithstanding the




                                       49

<PAGE>



               foregoing,  the titles and status of the former Matrix  employees
               in  their  role  as an  employee  of  Denbury  or  the  Surviving
               Corporation  may not be the same  status or level as they were at
               Matrix due to Denbury's significantly larger size;

                    y. a reduction in the employee's  base salary (not including
               Bonus) below their base salary as of the Effective Time;

                    z. the  requirement by Denbury or the Surviving  Corporation
               for the  employee  (without  the consent of the  employee)  to be
               based at any place outside a twenty-five  (25) mile radius of his
               place of  employment  immediately  prior to the  Effective  Time,
               except for reasonably required travel on the employer's business,
               or, in the event the employee  consents to any relocation  beyond
               such 25 mile  radius,  the  failure  by the  employer  to pay (or
               reimburse  the  employee)  for  all  reasonable  moving  expenses
               incurred by him relating to a change of his  principal  residence
               in connection with such relocation.

               (vii)  Denbury  or  the  Surviving  Corporation  may  deduct  and
          withhold from the severance  benefits payable pursuant to this Section
          7.01(c)  such  amounts  as  Denbury or the  Surviving  Corporation  is
          required  to deduct and  withhold  with  respect to the making of such
          payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local
          or  foreign  tax law,  and  Denbury  agrees  to  remit,  or cause  the
          Surviving  Corporation to remit,  to the proper taxing  authority such
          amounts so withheld.

          (d) Service  Credit.  To the extent  length of service is relevant for
     purposes  of  eligibility,  satisfying  any  waiting  periods,  evidence of
     insurability requirements, preexisting condition limitations, participation
     or vesting (but not the actual  accrual of benefits  except with respect to
     any vacation  benefits  provided by Denbury or the  Surviving  Corporation)
     under any employee  benefit plan,  program or  arrangement  established  or
     maintained by Denbury or the Surviving Corporation, the former employees of
     Matrix  who  become  employees  of the  Surviving  Corporation  or  Denbury
     immediately  after the Effective Time shall be credited for service accrued
     as of the Effective Time with Matrix or its Subsidiaries to the extent such
     service was credited under a similar  Matrix  Benefit Plan,  except that no
     such prior service credit will be given for participation or eligibility in
     the Denbury Stock Option Plan or the Denbury 401(k) Plan.

          (e) Adjustments to Merger Consideration.  If the aggregate amount paid
     by Denbury or the Surviving  Corporation in severance  benefits pursuant to
     Sections  7.01(c)(i),  (ii) and (iv) during the period  ending on the first
     anniversary of the Effective Time ("Aggregate  Severance Benefits") is less
     than $1,100,000,  then Denbury shall pay to the Matrix Common  Shareholders
     in cash within 30 days  following  the first  anniversary  of the Effective
     Time,  the  amount by which  $1,100,000  exceeds  the  Aggregate  Severance
     Benefits.  If the Aggregate Severance Benefits exceed $1,100,000,  then the




                                       50

<PAGE>



     Matrix Common  Shareholders shall pay to Denbury in cash within thirty (30)
     days following the first  anniversary of the Effective  Time, the lesser of
     (i) the amount by which the Aggregate Severance Benefits exceed $1,100,000,
     or (ii) the amount of the Contract Severance Benefits,  on a pro rata basis
     in accordance with their ownership of Matrix Common Stock.

          (f) Bonus Plan. Denbury  acknowledges  that,  pursuant to the terms of
     the Incentive  Compensation  Agreement,  dated as of March 27, 2000 ("Bonus
     Plan"),  by and among Matrix and certain  employees of Matrix, or otherwise
     pursuant  to  related  Matrix  Shareholder  action an  aggregate  amount of
     $2,000,000  ("Bonus") will be paid by Matrix at Closing to the employees of
     Matrix named,  and in the amounts as set forth,  on Exhibit 7.01(f) hereto.
     Such  employees  of Matrix  agree  that in  consideration  of such  payment
     neither  Denbury  nor the  Surviving  Corporation  shall  have any  further
     obligation  under the Bonus Plan and such  Bonus  Plan shall be  terminated
     upon payment of the Bonus with no further  action on the part of Denbury or
     the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 7.02. Lockup  Agreements.  For so long as EnCap Energy Capital Fund
III, L.P., EnCap Energy Capital Fund III-B, L.P., BOCP Energy Partners, L.P. and
Energy  Capital  Investment  Company  PLC,  (the  "EnCap  Shareholders")  in the
aggregate hold 5% or more of the  outstanding  Denbury  Common Stock,  the EnCap
Shareholders shall, at the request of Denbury or any managing  underwriter of an
underwritten  offering  with  respect to  Denbury  Common  Stock,  enter into an
agreement  in  customary  form  to  refrain  from  selling  any  of  such  EnCap
Shareholders'  Denbury  Common  Stock  during a  reasonable  period prior to and
following the effective date of a registration  statement  filed by Denbury with
respect to sale of its common shares or, in the case of an underwritten offering
pursuant to a registration statement of Form S-3 for an offering to be made on a
continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 of the Securities Act, within a reasonable
time prior to and after the date of the  closing of the  underwriting  agreement
entered into in connection therewith,  other than with respect to an offering in
which the EnCap Shareholders sell shares of Denbury Common Stock pursuant to the
registration rights set forth in Article VI.

     Section 7.03.  Matrix Board Seat. On or before the Effective Time,  Denbury
shall take all action  necessary  to increase the size of its board of directors
to nine (9)  directors  and shall fill the vacancy  created by this  increase by
appointing  a  director   designated  by  the  EnCap  Shareholders  (the  "Encap
Designee"),  effective  on the  Effective  Time,  to serve until the 2002 annual
meeting of  shareholders  of Denbury or until his earlier  death,  disability or
resignation;  provided that such person satisfies all eligibility  requirements,
conditions and policies  established by Denbury as of the date hereof applicable
to director nominees. If prior to the expiration of his term as a director,  the
EnCap  Designee  dies,  is  disabled,  or  resigns  from  the  Denbury  board of
directors,  Denbury  shall take all actions as are necessary to fill the vacancy
with a  person  designated  by  the  EnCap  Shareholders  (subject  to the  same
requirements, conditions and policies referenced above).

     Section 7.04. Release of Claims. As of the Effective Time:

          (a) Each of the Matrix Shareholders does hereby forever waive, release
     and  discharge  Matrix from any and all losses which relate to or arise out
     of any dealings,  relationships or transactions,  from the beginning of the
     world to the  Effective  Time, by and between such Matrix  Shareholder  and




                                       51

<PAGE>



     Matrix that such Matrix  Shareholder  ever had, now has or  hereafter  can,
     shall or may have, whether or not now known,  against Matrix other than (i)
     liability for  obligations  for wages and benefits for periods prior to the
     Closing Date and (ii) as provided in Section 7.04(d).

          (b) Matrix does hereby  forever  waive,  release and discharge each of
     the Matrix  Shareholders  from any and all losses  which relate to or arise
     out of any dealings,  relationships or transactions,  from the beginning of
     the world to the Effective Time, by and between such Matrix Shareholder and
     Matrix that Matrix ever had, now has or hereafter  can,  shall or may have,
     whether or not now known, against Matrix Shareholder other than as provided
     in Section 7.04(d).

          (c) Each of Matrix and the Matrix Shareholders  understands and agrees
     that pursuant to this Section 7.04(c),  it is expressly  waiving all claims
     (other than those expressly reserved as set forth in Sections 7.04(a),  (b)
     and (d)),  including,  but not limited to those claims which such releasing
     party may not know or suspect or exist,  which if known may have materially
     affected the decision to provide this release,  and each of Matrix and each
     Matrix  Shareholder waives any rights under applicable law that provides to
     the contrary.

          (d) Nothing  contained in this Section  7.04(d)  shall be, or shall be
     deemed to be, a release of Matrix, any Matrix Shareholder,  Denbury, Merger
     Sub, or the Surviving  Corporation  from any  liability  arising under this
     Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby or herein.

     Section 7.05. Payment of Expenses. All expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such expense,  whether or not
the Merger is  consummated,  except that Matrix shall pay the first  $200,000 of
expenses,  including  without  limitation  all fees  and  expenses  of  counsel,
accountants,  experts  and  consultants,   incurred  by  Matrix  or  the  Matrix
Shareholders,  or on  their  behalf,  in  connection  with  or  related  to  the
authorization,  preparation,  negotiation,  execution  or  performance  of  this
Agreement  and all other matters  related to the Closing of the Merger,  and the
Matrix Shareholders shall pay all such expenses in excess of $200,000.

     Section 7.06. Seismic Transfer Fees. In the event that the fees that are or
will be  incurred by Denbury or the  Surviving  Corporation  to transfer  all of
Matrix's  interest in seismic,  geological and geophysical data to the Surviving
Corporation  exceed $1,100,000 in the aggregate,  then the Merger  Consideration
payable to the Matrix Common  Shareholders  pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) shall
be reduced by the amount by which the aggregate  amount of all such fees exceeds
$1,100,000.  Denbury  may  reduce  the  cash  to be paid  to the  Matrix  Common
Shareholders  at the Closing  pursuant to Section  2.01(a)(i) in accordance with
this Section 7.06 and may apply against the Holdback any amount that reduces the
Merger  Consideration under this Section 7.06 that is incurred by Denbury or the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time.

     Section 7.07. Options.

          (a) Prior to 30 days after the date of this Agreement,  Matrix and the
     Matrix  Shareholders  shall  take  all  actions  necessary  to  cause  each




                                       52

<PAGE>



     unexercised   option  to  purchase  common  stock  of  Matrix   outstanding
     immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Matrix Option Plan,
     which shall not exceed  options to purchase  380,469 shares of common stock
     of Matrix in the  aggregate,  to be  mandatorily  surrendered  two (2) days
     after the  Effective  Time to the  Surviving  Corporation  pursuant  to the
     provisions  of  Section  9.2(b) of the  Matrix  Option  Plan in return  for
     payment  to the  former  option  holders by the  Surviving  Corporation  of
     $7,334,072 in the aggregate,  or approximately $19.2764 per share of Matrix
     Common Stock  underlying each  outstanding  unexercised  Matrix option,  in
     cash. On or before the Effective Time, such outstanding unexercised options
     shall cease to represent a right to acquire  shares of Matrix  Common Stock
     and shall become the right to receive the  consideration  set forth in this
     Section 7.07.

          (b) If and to the extent  required  by the terms of the Matrix  Option
     Plan  or  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  any  agreements  evidencing  grants
     thereunder,  Matrix shall use its reasonable  efforts to obtain the consent
     of  each  holder  of  outstanding  options  to the  treatment  provided  in
     subparagraph (a) of this Section 7.07.

          (c) Denbury or the Surviving  Corporation may deduct and withhold from
     the  consideration  payable  pursuant  to Section  7.07(a) to any holder of
     options to  purchase  Matrix  Common  Stock such  amounts as Denbury or the
     Surviving  Corporation  is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to
     the  making  of such  payment  under  the Code or any  other  provision  of
     federal,  state,  local or foreign tax law and Denbury agrees to remit,  or
     cause the Surviving  Corporation to remit,  to the proper taxing  authority
     such amounts so withheld.

     Section  7.08.  Reorganization  of Merger Sub.  Prior to the Closing  Date,
Denbury may, in its sole  discretion,  determine to  reorganize  Merger Sub in a
state  other than  Delaware or into a form of entity  other than a  corporation,
provided that after such reorganization,  Denbury and Merger Sub would not be in
breach of any  representation or warranty of Denbury and Merger Sub contained in
Article IV or covenant  under Article V, except to the extent that Merger Sub is
no longer a corporation, in which case the representations contained in Sections
4.01,  4.02,  4.04 and 4.09 to be made as of the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be modified  solely to reflect  the new form of  business  entity of Merger Sub;
provided,  however, that Denbury will take no such action if it would jeopardize
the  qualification  of the Merger as a  tax-free  reorganization  under  Section
368(a) of the Code.

     Section 7.09. Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

          (a) Denbury or Merger Sub and Matrix and its  Subsidiaries  shall each
     use all commercially  reasonable  efforts promptly (i) to take, or cause to
     be taken, all appropriate  action,  and do, or cause to be done, all things
     necessary,  proper  or  advisable  under  applicable  Law or  otherwise  to
     consummate  and  make  effective  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this
     Agreement,  (ii) in the case of  Denbury  to cause the Merger Sub to comply
     with all of its obligations under this Agreement,  and subject to the terms
     and  conditions  hereof,  to take those steps  necessary to consummate  the
     Merger;  (iii) to  obtain  from any  Governmental  Entities  any  consents,
     licenses, Permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders required to
     be obtained by Matrix or any of its  Subsidiaries or Denbury or Merger Sub,
     respectively, in connection with the authorization, execution, delivery and




                                       53

<PAGE>



     performance  of this  Agreement and the  consummation  of the  transactions
     contemplated hereby, including, without limitation, the Merger, and (iv) to
     make  all  necessary  filings,  and  thereafter  make  any  other  required
     submissions,  with respect to this Agreement and the Merger  required under
     (a) the Securities  Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations
     thereunder,  and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, and
     (b) any other  applicable  Law; and Denbury and Matrix shall cooperate with
     each other in  connection  with the making of all such  filings,  including
     providing  copies  of all such  documents  to the  nonfiling  party and its
     advisors  prior to filing and, if  requested,  shall accept all  reasonable
     additions,  deletions or changes suggested in connection therewith.  Matrix
     and Denbury shall furnish all  information  required for any application or
     other  filing  to be made  pursuant  to the rules  and  regulations  of any
     applicable Law in connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this
     Agreement.

          (b) Denbury and Matrix and its Subsidiaries  agree to cooperate and to
     use all  reasonable  efforts to contest  and resist any  action,  including
     legislative,  administrative  or  judicial  action,  and to  have  vacated,
     lifted,  reversed or overturned any decree,  judgment,  injunction or other
     order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) (an "Order") that is in
     effect and that  restricts,  prevents or prohibits the  consummation of the
     Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
     without  limitation,  by  vigorously  pursuing  all  available  avenues  of
     administrative and judicial appeal and all available legislative action.

          (c) Matrix and Denbury shall each promptly give any notices  regarding
     the Merger, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to third
     parties  required by Law or by any  Material  Contract,  license,  lease or
     other  material  agreement  to which it is a party or by which it is bound,
     and use, and cause its Subsidiaries, if any, to use, all reasonable efforts
     to obtain any third  party  Consents or waivers  (i)  necessary,  proper or
     advisable to consummate the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement,
     (ii)  otherwise  required under any  contracts,  licenses,  leases or other
     agreements  in  connection  with  the   consummation  of  the  transactions
     contemplated  by this  Agreement,  or (iii)  required to prevent a material
     adverse effect from occurring;  provided,  however,  that this Section 7.09
     shall not impose any obligations on or confer any rights upon any person or
     entity other than the parties to this Agreement.

     Section  7.10.  Public  Announcements.  Except  as  otherwise  required  by
applicable Law or the rules of NYSE,  neither  Denbury nor Matrix nor any of its
Subsidiaries  shall issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public  announcement  with  respect to, or otherwise  make any public  statement
concerning,  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement without the consent
of the other party, which consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  Further,
prior to any  disclosure as required by applicable Law or the rules of the NYSE,
each  party  shall  provide  each other  party to this  Agreement  a  reasonable
opportunity  to review  and  comment  on the form of such  disclosure  and shall
incorporate any reasonably  requested changes to such disclosure,  provided that
such requested  changes would not (i) cause a violation of applicable Law or the
rules of the NYSE or (ii) be  inconsistent  with such party's prior practices on
similar disclosures.

     Section 7.11. Confidentiality Agreement.

          (a) Each party hereto  agrees that all  Confidential  Information  (as
     defined  below)  received by such party (the  "Receiving  Party")  from any
     other party hereto (the "Disclosing  Party") shall be kept  confidential by
     the Receiving  Party and shall not be disclosed by the  Receiving  Party in
     any manner whatsoever; provided, however, that (i) any of such Confidential
     Information may be disclosed to such directors,  officers,  employees,  and
     authorized   representatives   (including  without  limitation   attorneys,
     accountants, consultants, bankers, and financial advisors) of the Receiving
     Party  (collectively,  the "Receiving Party's  Representatives") as need to
     know such  information  for the purpose of evaluating  the Merger (it being
     understood that such Receiving Party's Representatives shall be informed by
     the Receiving  Party of the  confidential  nature of such  information  and
     shall be  required  to treat  such  information  confidentially),  (ii) any
     disclosure of  Confidential  Information may be made to the extent to which
     the Disclosing Party consents in writing,  (iii)  Confidential  Information
     may  be  disclosed  by  the  Receiving  Party  or  any  Receiving   Party's
     Representatives  to the extent  that,  in the  opinion  of counsel  for the
     Receiving Party or such Receiving Party's Representatives, they are legally
     compelled to do so,  provided that,  prior to making such  disclosure,  the
     party being  legally  compelled to disclose  such  information  advises and
     consults with the Disclosing  Party  regarding such disclosure and provided
     further that the party being legally compelled to disclose such information
     discloses only that portion of the  Confidential  Information as is legally
     required, and (iv) any of such Confidential Information may be disclosed to
     any banks or other financial  institutions or other  prospective  investors
     that may provide Financing if such banks or other financial institutions or
     other  prospective  investors  agree to comply with the  provisions of this
     Section.  The term "Confidential  Information",  as used herein,  means all
     information  (irrespective of the form of communication)  obtained by or on
     behalf of a Receiving Party from a Disclosing Party or its Representatives,
     other than information which (i) was or becomes generally  available to the
     public other than as a result of disclosure  by the Receiving  Party or any
     Receiving  Party's  Representative,  (ii) was or becomes  available  to the
     Receiving  Party on a  nonconfidential  basis  prior to  disclosure  to the
     Receiving Party or its  Representatives,  or (iii) was or becomes available
     to the Receiving Party from a source other than the Disclosing Party or its
     Representatives,  provided  that such source is not known by the  Receiving
     Party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with the Disclosing Party.

          (b) If this  Agreement  is  terminated,  each  Receiving  Party  shall
     promptly  return,  and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause all
     Receiving  Party  Representatives  to  promptly  return,  all  Confidential
     Information to the Disclosing  Party without  retaining any copies thereof,
     provided that such portion of the  Confidential  Information as consists of
     notes,  compilations,   analyses,  reports,  studies,  or  other  documents
     prepared by the Receiving  Party or the Receiving  Party's  Representatives
     shall be destroyed.

          (c) This Section 7.11 supersedes the letter agreement  between Denbury
     and  Matrix  dated  April 9,  2001  and such  letter  agreement  is  hereby
     terminated,  provided, however, that any cause of action for breach of such
     letter  agreement  shall  survive  such  termination  for the period of the
     applicable statute of limitations for such cause of action.

     Section 7.12.  Matrix Benefit Plans.  Matrix,  its  Subsidiaries  and their
ERISA Affiliates,  as applicable,  shall each terminate,  effective as of a date
that precedes the Closing Date,  such of the Matrix  Benefit Plans which Denbury
requires to be terminated.  Denbury shall receive from Matrix evidence that each
such Matrix  Benefit Plan have been  terminated  pursuant to resolutions of each
such entity's  board of directors  (the form and  substance of such  resolutions
shall be subject to review and  approval of  Denbury),  effective  as of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date. On or prior to the effective date of its
termination,  the  Qualified  Plan  shall be  amended  for  compliance  with the
applicable law. In connection with its termination,  the Qualified Plan shall be
submitted  on or before the Closing Date by Matrix,  if possible,  or as soon as
administratively  feasible  thereafter  using  best  efforts,  to  the  IRS  for
determination  letter as to its  qualification in form under Code Section 401(a)
and as to its  trust's  exemption  from  federal  income tax under Code  Section
501(a); provided, however, that any submission filed after the Closing Date that
is not filed by the  Surviving  Corporation  is  subject  to review by  benefits
counsel for Denbury prior to filing.  In the event that distribution or rollover
of assets from the trust of a Qualified  Plan which is  terminated is reasonably
anticipated to trigger liquidation charges,  surrender charges, or other fees to
be imposed upon the account of any participant or beneficiary of such terminated
plan or upon Matrix, a Subsidiary or plan sponsor,  then the Matrix Shareholders
shall  reimburse and indemnify  Denbury for any and all charges and fees that it
has paid or incurred.  Matrix or any  Subsidiary  shall take such actions as are
necessary to  reasonably  estimate  the amount of such  charges  and/or fees and
provide such estimate in writing to Denbury prior to the Closing Date.

     Section 7.13. Defects.

          (a)  Defect  Notice  and Total  Defect  Value.  On or before the Final
     Notice Date (as defined in Section  3.13(a)),  Denbury shall have the right
     to identify Defects (as defined in Section  3.13(a)),  and notify Matrix on
     or before the Final Notice Date of the same.  Such notices given by Denbury
     ("Defect  Notice")  shall be in writing  and shall set forth in  reasonable
     detail:  (i) the basis of the Defect that Denbury believes exists;  (ii) to
     the extent that Defects relate to specific Matrix Properties, a description
     of the Matrix  Properties  that Denbury claims are Defect  Properties;  and
     (iii) Denbury's good faith reasonable  estimate of the value of each Defect
     ("Denbury's  Defect Value"),  which value shall be based upon the Allocated
     Values set forth in Exhibit B if the Defect is a Special  Defect or a Title
     Defect,  but shall be set by Denbury  without  reference  to the  Allocated
     Value if the Defect is an  Environmental  Defect or a General  Defect,  and
     shall mean the amount of probable  loss,  liability,  diminution  of value,
     costs and  expenses  which would  reasonably  be expected to be suffered or
     incurred by the Surviving Corporation as a result of the existence,  and/or
     (if  appropriate,  Denbury  chooses to include such amount) the cure,  of a
     Defect. The total value of all the Defects specified in all Defect Notices,
     shall be called the "Total Defect  Value".  The Total Defect Value shall be
     adjusted as provided in this Section 7.13.

     Subject to the provisions of the next  succeeding  paragraph,  Denbury will
     not have the right to declare any  circumstance or condition a Defect after
     the  Final  Notice  Date,  but to the  extent  that  such  circumstance  or
     condition is a breach of a representation or warranty, such circumstance or
     condition may still be the basis of a claim by Denbury for indemnification,
     pursuant to and in accordance with Article VIII of this Agreement.




                                       56

<PAGE>



     With  respect to any Title  Defect,  if  Denbury  fails to give to Matrix a
     Defect  Notice  with  respect to such  Title  Defect on or before the Final
     Notice  Date,  it shall be deemed  that  Denbury  has elected to waive such
     Title Defect and to treat such Title Defect as a Permitted Encumbrance ( as
     defined in Section  3.13(a)),  and to accept the Matrix Properties to which
     the Title Defect  relates  without a reduction of the Merger  Consideration
     provided for by Section  2.01(a)(i)  and subject to such Title Defect.  The
     amounts  expended  and  obligations  incurred  by Matrix to acquire the D&O
     Policy as referenced in Section 8.01 below shall be included as part of the
     Total Defect Value.

          (b) Cure or Failure to Cure Defects Prior to Closing.  After  Matrix's
     receipt of a Defect Notice,  Matrix will have the opportunity,  but not the
     obligation,  to  cure  prior  to  delivery  of a "Cure  Notice"  (hereafter
     defined),  or to elect to have Denbury or the Surviving Corporation attempt
     to cure prior to the Final Cure Date, the Defects specified therein. Within
     10 days of its  receipt  of any  Defect  Notice,  Matrix  shall  furnish to
     Denbury a written  notice (a "Cure  Notice") which will specify all Defects
     that Matrix claims to have cured prior to delivery of the Cure Notice.  The
     Cure Notice will also  specify all Defects  that Matrix has elected to have
     Denbury or the  Surviving  Corporation  attempt to cure after  Closing  and
     prior to the Final  Cure Date  ("Post-Closing  Defects").  With  respect to
     Defects that Matrix claims to have cured prior to the Cure Notice, the Cure
     Notice shall include  information  and documents  evidencing  the cure. The
     Total Defect Value (as  estimated  by Denbury in Defect  Notices)  shall be
     reduced by the value of all  Defects  cured (and to the extent  included in
     such  value by the cost to cure  such  Defects)  prior to the Cure  Notice,
     except for Defects that Denbury disputes having been cured. Also, the Total
     Defect Value shall be increased by all amounts actually  expended,  and all
     obligations actually incurred,  by Matrix to cure Defects after the date of
     this  Agreement  and  prior  to the Cure  Notice,  whether  or not  Denbury
     disputes the cure.  Until the Final Cure Date, the parties shall furnish to
     each  other  such  agreements,  documents  and  materials  as they may deem
     appropriate  with  respect  to  attempts  to  cure   Post-Closing   Defects
     ("Curative Materials"). In the event that any Defect is neither cured prior
     to Matrix  providing  the Cure Notice,  nor  included in the Post  Closings
     Defects, such Defect (herein called a "Closing Defect") will not be subject
     to cure  subsequent to Closing in accordance with this Section 7.13 and the
     value of such Defect will remain in the Total Defect Value. With respect to
     obligations of Matrix to be performed after the Closing Date, references in
     this Section  7.13 to Matrix shall be deemed to refer to the Matrix  Common
     Shareholders, who shall be represented by Robin R. Mingo for the purpose of
     performing such obligations.

          (c) Determination of Defect Value.  After Matrix's receipt of a Defect
     Notice,  the parties,  if necessary,  shall  promptly meet and negotiate in
     good faith to reach an agreement as to the value of each Defect.  If Matrix
     does not agree with Denbury's estimate of the value of any Defect furnished
     with a Defect  Notice,  Matrix shall  furnish to Denbury  Matrix's  written
     estimate  of such  value  prior to  commencement  of  negotiations.  If the
     parties' negotiations fail to result in an agreement at or prior to Closing
     as to the value of any Defect,  then for purposes of calculating  the Total
     Defect  Value,  determining  any  increase in the  Holdback  under  Section
     7.13(e),  and determination as to possible termination of this Agreement by
     Denbury or Matrix  under  Section  7.14(b),  an amount  equal to  Denbury's
     Defect  Value shall  apply.  At such time as the value of a Defect has been




                                       57

<PAGE>



     agreed to by both parties through  negotiations,  or has been determined by
     arbitration  under  Section  11.12,  the revised  value  shall  replace the
     initial Denbury Defect Value,  and the Total Defect Value shall be properly
     adjusted.

          (d)  Adjustment to Total Defect Value for  Post-Closing  Defects Cured
     Prior to the Final Cure Date,  Arbitration  of Disputes.  After the Closing
     Date,  Denbury  or the  Surviving  Corporation  shall  attempt  to cure the
     Post-Closing  Defects which the parties  agree should be cured.  The actual
     amounts  reasonably  expended,   and  the  actual  obligations   reasonably
     incurred,  by Denbury or the  Surviving  Corporation  to cure  Post-Closing
     Defects  prior to the Final  Cure Date  shall be added to the Total  Defect
     Value.  Also,  to the extent that the parties  agree that any  Post-Closing
     Defect has been cured on or prior to the Final Cure Date,  the  appropriate
     portion  of the value of that  Defect  (and if  included  in such value the
     appropriate  portion of the cost to cure such Defect) included in the Total
     Defect Value on the Closing Date,  based on the extent that such Defect has
     been cured,  shall be eliminated from the Total Defect Value.  Any disputes
     as to whether  Post-Closing  Defects  should be cured,  any  disputes as to
     whether Defects of any nature have been cured, any disputes as to the value
     of Defects of any  nature,  and any  disputes as to the  reasonableness  of
     amounts  expended or  obligations  incurred to cure  Post-Closing  Defects,
     shall be submitted  together to one arbitration (the "Defect  Arbitration")
     under Section 11.12,  which  arbitrations shall be one proceeding but shall
     address each disputed  Defect  separately,  and the adjustment to the Total
     Defect  Value  shall  be made  in  accordance  with  the  decisions  of the
     arbitrator(s).  The  provisions of this Section  7.13(d) are in addition to
     and  not in  substitution  or  replacement  of the  provisions  of  Section
     2.01(d).

          (e) Adjustment to the Holdback at Closing for Defects. At the Closing,
     an amount equal to any excess of the Total Defect Value (as  calculated  as
     of the Closing  Date) above the Defect  Basket shall be added to the amount
     of the  Holdback,  and  thereby  reduce  the Merger  Consideration  paid at
     Closing under Section 2.01(a)(i).

          (f)  Defect  Basket.  The  "Defect  Basket"  shall  be the  amount  of
     $1,500,000.

          (g)  Settlement  of the  Total  Defect  Value.  Ten  (10)  days  after
     occurrence  of both the Final Cure Date and the  effectiveness  of a final,
     binding and  non-appealable  award in the Defect  Arbitration,  the parties
     shall  settle any  adjustments  to the  Merger  Consideration  relating  to
     Defects,  and any adjustment to the Total Defect Value. If the Total Defect
     Value (as finally  adjusted)  exceeds the Defect  Basket,  Denbury shall be
     entitled  to be paid the excess of the Total  Defect  Value over the Defect
     Basket from the Holdback,  or to be paid by the Matrix Common  Shareholders
     if the Holdback is insufficient to pay such amount.  Any funds remaining in
     the  Holdback  after  such  payment  to Denbury  that were  placed  therein
     pursuant  to  Section  7.13(e)  shall  be  refunded  to the  Matrix  Common
     Shareholders. If the Total Defect Value is less than the Defect Basket, the
     Matrix  Common  Shareholders  shall  be  entitled  to be paid  any  amounts
     remaining in the Holdback placed therein pursuant to Section  7.13(e).  Any
     amounts paid to Matrix Common Shareholders pursuant to this Section 7.13(g)
     shall  be paid on a pro rata  basis in  accordance  with  their  respective
     ownership of Matrix Common Stock.

          (h) Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary,  Matrix shall have
     until 10 days  after the Final  Notice  Date to  deliver  to Denbury a Cure
     Notice with respect to any Defect,  notwithstanding  when Denbury  provided
     Matrix with a Defect Notice identifying such Defect.

     Section 7.14. Preferential Rights, Rights to Terminate:

          (a) Within ten (10) days of the date of this  Agreement,  Matrix shall
     deliver  such  notices and other  documents  as may be required in order to
     trigger Preferential Rights (as defined in Section 3.13(a)) which have been
     identified.  Prior to  Closing,  Matrix may, in lieu  thereof,  obtain,  or
     attempt to obtain, a waiver of the exercise of any Preferential  Rights. If
     a third  party  that has been  offered  an  interest  in a Matrix  Property
     pursuant to a  Preferential  Right elects prior to Closing to exercise such
     rights and Matrix  receives  written  notice of such election  prior to the
     Closing Date,  Denbury  shall cause to be made,  within ten (10) days after
     the Closing,  an assignment of the Matrix Property subject to such election
     to the party exercising such Preferential Right.

          (b) If the  sum of (i)  the  cumulative  value  of  Matrix  Properties
     affected by third party exercise(s) of Preferential  Rights,  plus (ii) the
     Total Defect Value as calculated on the Closing Date,  exceeds  $9,000,000,
     each of Denbury and Matrix  shall have the  unequivocal  right to terminate
     this Agreement.

          (c) If  Denbury  fails  to give  Matrix a Defect  Notice  alleging  an
     Environmental   Defect  with  respect  to  any  circumstance  or  condition
     specifically  described in a written  report  prepared in  connection  with
     Denbury's due diligence review of the environmental condition of the Matrix
     Properties,  such circumstance or condition will not constitute a breach of
     any of the  representations or warranties of the Matrix Common Shareholders
     set forth in Section 3.12 above.

     Section  7.15.  Grant of Farmout  Option.  On or before the  Closing  Date,
Matrix will grant a Farmout  Agreement  Option  ("Option") to an entity owned by
the  Matrix  Common  Shareholders  in a form  mutually  agreeable  to Matrix and
Denbury,  the  substance  of  which  shall be in  accordance  with  those  terms
contained in Exhibit 7.15.

     Section  7.16.  Amendment  of Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule.  Matrix and the
Matrix Common  Shareholders  shall have the right prior to the Final Notice Date
to amend any section of the Matrix Disclosure Schedule provided,  however,  that
any such  amendment may be a basis for a Defect under the  provisions of Section
7.13 above.

     Section  7.17.  Future  Cooperation.  Denbury,  Merger  Sub and the  Matrix
Shareholders  shall each deliver or cause to be delivered to the other following
the Closing Date such additional instruments as the other may reasonably request
for the purposes of fully carrying out this Agreement.  The Matrix  Shareholders
will cooperate  with, and use their  reasonable best efforts to have the present
officers,  directors and employees of Matrix cooperate with, Denbury, Merger Sub
and the  Matrix  Shareholders  at and  after  the  Closing  Date  in  furnishing
information,  evidence,  testimony and other  assistance in connection  with any
actions, proceedings, or disputes of any nature



                                       59

with respect to matters pertaining to periods prior to the Closing Date and in
connection with fully carrying out this Agreement and obtaining consents and
approvals necessary by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby.

     Section 7.18. Tax-Free Reorganization.

          (a) From and after the date of this  Agreement and until the Effective
     Time,  each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
     Merger to qualify,  and no party  hereto  will take any  action,  cause any
     action to be taken,  fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to
     be taken  which  action or failure  to act would  prevent  the Merger  from
     qualifying as a  reorganization  under the  provisions of Section 368(a) of
     the Code. Following the Effective Time, neither the Surviving  Corporation,
     Denbury nor any of their Affiliates shall take any action, cause any action
     to be taken,  fail to take any  action  or cause  any  action to fail to be
     taken,  which  action or failure  to act could  cause the Merger to fail to
     qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

          (b) As of the date hereof,  Matrix does not know of any reason (i) why
     it would not be able to deliver to Jenkens &  Gilchrist,  PC or  Thompson &
     Knight  LLP,  at  the  date  of  the  legal  opinions  referred  to  below,
     certificates  substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
     guidelines,  with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable
     such firms to deliver the legal opinions  contemplated  by Section  9.01(f)
     and  9.02(e),  and  Matrix  hereby  agrees  to  deliver  such  certificates
     effective as of the date of such  opinions or (ii) why Jenkens & Gilchrist,
     PC or  Thompson  & Knight  LLP would not be able to  deliver  the  opinions
     required by Section 9.01(f) and 9.02(e).

          (c) As of the date hereof, Denbury does not know of any reason (i) why
     it would not be able to deliver to Jenkens &  Gilchrist,  PC or  Thompson &
     Knight  LLP,  at  the  date  of  the  legal  opinions  referred  to  below,
     certificates  substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling
     guidelines,  with customary exceptions and modifications thereto, to enable
     such firms to deliver the legal opinions  contemplated by Sections  9.01(f)
     and  9.02(e),  and  Denbury  hereby  agrees to  deliver  such  certificates
     effective as of the date of such  opinions  or(ii) why Jenkens & Gilchrist,
     PC or  Thompson  & Knight  LLP would not be able to  deliver  the  opinions
     required by Sections 9.01(f) and 9.02(e).

     Section  7.19.  Tax  Matters.  The  following  provisions  shall govern the
allocation  of  responsibility  as between the Denbury and Matrix and the Matrix
Common Shareholders for certain tax matters following the Closing Date:

          (a) Tax Periods Ending on Closing Date and Tax Periods Ending Prior to
     the Closing Date with Tax Returns Filed After the Closing  Date.  After the
     Closing  Date,  Denbury  shall  timely  prepare or cause to be prepared any
     Matrix Tax Returns  required to be filed with respect to Tax periods ending
     on the Closing  Date or Tax periods  ending  prior to the Closing  Date but
     filed after the Closing Date (the  "Pre-Closing  Returns").  Denbury  shall
     deliver a copy of any Pre-Closing Returns to the Matrix Common Shareholders
     on or before  thirty  (30) days  prior to the  applicable  due date of such
     return  (as  the  same  may  be  validly   extended).   The  Matrix  Common




                                       60

<PAGE>



     Shareholders shall be liable for any Taxes of Matrix payable by Matrix with
     respect to Tax  periods  ending on or before  March 31,  2001 to the extent
     such Taxes are not reflected in the reserve for Tax liability  (rather than
     any reserve for deferred Taxes  established  to reflect timing  differences
     between book and Tax income) on the Matrix Financial Statements as of March
     31,  2001  ("Additional  Matrix  Pre-Closing  Taxes").  The  Matrix  Common
     Shareholders  shall  indemnify  Denbury  for such  Additional  Matrix  Pre-
     Closing  Taxes in  accordance  with the  provisions of Article VIII of this
     Agreement. To the extent there are Additional Matrix Pre-Closing Taxes that
     are not  satisfied  under  Section  2.01(d) of this  Agreement,  the Matrix
     Common  Shareholders shall reimburse Denbury for any such excess Additional
     Matrix Pre-Closing Taxes within fifteen (15) days of the payment by Denbury
     or its Subsidiary of such Taxes.

          (b) Tax Periods  Beginning  Before and Ending After the Closing  Date.
     After  the  Closing  Date,  Denbury  shall  timely  prepare  or cause to be
     prepared  any Matrix Tax Returns  required to be filed with  respect to Tax
     periods  which begin before the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date
     (the "Straddle  Returns").  The Matrix Common  Shareholders shall be liable
     for any Taxes of Matrix  payable by Matrix  with  respect to the portion of
     such Tax periods  ending on March 31, 2001 to the extent such Taxes are not
     reflected  in the reserve for Tax  liability  (rather  than any reserve for
     deferred Taxes established to reflect timing  differences  between book and
     Tax  income)  on the  Matrix  Financial  Statements  as of March  31,  2001
     ("Additional Matrix Straddle Taxes").  The Matrix Common Shareholders shall
     indemnify  Denbury for such Additional  Matrix Straddle Taxes in accordance
     with the provisions of Article VIII of this Agreement.  To the extent there
     are Additional  Matrix  Straddle Taxes that are not satisfied under Section
     2.01(d) of this Agreement,  the Matrix Common  Shareholders shall reimburse
     Denbury for any such excess Additional Matrix Straddle Taxes within fifteen
     (15) days of the payment by Denbury or its  Subsidiary  of such Taxes.  For
     purposes of this Section 7.19(b), in the case of any Taxes that are imposed
     on a periodic  basis and are payable for a Tax period  that  includes  (but
     does not end on) March 31, 2001, the portion of such Taxes which relates to
     the portion of such Tax period ending on the March 31, 2001 shall be deemed
     equal to the amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended
     on the March 31,  2001.  Any  credits  relating to a Tax period that begins
     before and ends after March 31, 2001 shall be taken into  account as though
     the  relevant  Tax  period  ended on March  31,  2001.  All  determinations
     necessary to give effect to the  foregoing  allocations  shall be made in a
     manner consistent with prior practice of Matrix.

          (c)  Procedures  for  Pre-Closing  Returns and Straddle  Returns.  The
     Matrix  Common  Shareholders  shall have the right to review and comment on
     the  Pre-Closing  Returns and Straddle  Returns prior to filing and Denbury
     shall make or cause to be made such revisions to such  Pre-Closing  Returns
     and  Straddle  Returns as are  reasonably  requested  by the Matrix  Common
     Shareholders.  In the event of any reasonable  disagreement between Denbury
     and a majority of the Matrix Common  Shareholders  (determined based on the
     ownership  percentage  of the Matrix  Common  Shares at the  Closing  Date)
     regarding  the amount of taxable  income (or loss) to be  included  in such
     Pre-Closing  Returns and Straddle  Returns,  Denbury and the Matrix  Common
     Shareholders agree that the Pre-Closing  Returns and Straddle Returns shall
     be  submitted  to a  mutually  agreed  upon "Big 5"  independent  certified
     accounting  firm  other  than  an  independent  certified  accounting  firm




                                       61

<PAGE>



     currently used by Denbury,  Matrix or the Matrix Common  Shareholders.  Any
     determination  by the accounting  firm shall be binding on Denbury,  Matrix
     and the Matrix Common  Shareholders  as to the amount of taxable income (or
     loss) to be included in the Pre-Closing  Returns and Straddle  Returns.  If
     the  matter  submitted  to the  accounting  firm is  resolved  in  favor of
     Denbury,  the  Matrix  Common  Shareholders  shall  pay  all  costs  of the
     accounting  firm,  and if the  matter is  resolved  in favor of the  Matrix
     Common  Shareholders,  Denbury  shall pay all such costs.  If the matter is
     resolved  partially  in  favor  of each  party,  the  costs  shall be borne
     proportionately.  In filing the Pre-Closing  Returns and Straddle  Returns,
     Denbury shall make all computations of income, gains, losses and deductions
     and credits on a basis  consistent with the prior Tax Returns of Matrix and
     shall not change existing  elections or make new elections that would cause
     the  acceleration  of income or gains to the  Pre-Closing  Tax  Periods (as
     defined  below) or the  deferral  of  deductions,  losses or credits to the
     Post-Closing  Tax Periods.  Without the consent of a majority of the Matrix
     Common  Shareholders,  neither Denbury nor the Surviving Company shall file
     or  cause  to have  filed  any  amended  Tax  Return  with  respect  to the
     Pre-Closing   Returns  and  Straddle  Returns  or  agree  to  any  proposed
     adjustment  with  respect to any Tax Return  with  respect to Matrix to the
     extent such  amendment or adjustment  has the effect of shifting  income or
     receipts  from a Tax  period  after the  Closing  Date  ("Post-Closing  Tax
     Period")  to  a  Tax  period  prior  to  and  including  the  Closing  Date
     ("Pre-Closing  Tax Period"),  or in any way increases the taxable income or
     Taxes of Matrix for the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

          (d) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

               (i)  Denbury,  Matrix and the Matrix  Common  Shareholders  shall
          cooperate  fully,  as and to the extent  reasonably  requested  by any
          other such party, in connection with the preparation and filing of Tax
          Returns pursuant to this Section 7.19(d) and any audit,  litigation or
          other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include
          the retention and (upon any other such party's  request) the provision
          of records and information  which are reasonably  relevant to any such
          audit,  litigation or other proceeding and making employees  available
          on a mutually  convenient basis to provide additional  information and
          explanation  of any  material  provided  hereunder.  Denbury  and  the
          Surviving  Company  agree (A) to retain  all  books and  records  with
          respect to Tax matters  pertinent to Matrix relating to any Tax period
          beginning  before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute
          of  limitations  (and,  any  applicable  extensions  thereof)  of  the
          respective  Tax  periods,   and  to  abide  by  all  record  retention
          agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B) to give the
          other such party  reasonable  written  notice  prior to  transferring,
          destroying or discarding  any such books and records and, if the other
          party  so  requests,   Denbury,   Merger  Sub  or  the  Matrix  Common
          Shareholders,  as the case may be, shall allow the other party to take
          possession of such books and records.

               (ii)   Denbury,   Matrix,   Merger  Sub  and  the  Matrix  Common
          Shareholders  further  agree,  upon request,  to use their  reasonable
          efforts  to  obtain  any   certificate  or  other  document  from  any
          governmental  authority  or any other  person as may be  necessary  to
          mitigate,   reduce  or  eliminate   any  Tax  that  could  be  imposed
          (including,  but not  limited  to,  with  respect to the  transactions
          contemplated hereby).



                                       62

<PAGE>



               (iii)  Denbury,   Matrix,   Merger  Sub  and  the  Matrix  Common
          Shareholders  further agree,  upon request,  to provide the other such
          parties with all information  that any Party may be required to report
          pursuant  to  Section  6043 of the Code and all  Treasury  Regulations
          promulgated thereunder.

          (e) Tax  Sharing  Agreements.  All Tax sharing  agreements  or similar
     agreements with respect to or involving Matrix and its  Subsidiaries  shall
     be  terminated as of the Closing Date and,  after the Closing Date,  Matrix
     and its  Subsidiaries  shall  not be bound  thereby  or have any  liability
     thereunder.

          (f) Refunds/Tax Benefits.

               (i)  Any  refunds  (including  interest  to the  extent  actually
          received)  received  by  Denbury,  Matrix  or any  Affiliate  (and any
          equivalent  benefit  obtained through a reduction in Tax liability for
          any period or portion  thereof  after the date of this  Agreement)  of
          Taxes relating to Tax periods or portions  thereof ending on or before
          March  31,  2001  shall  be  for  the  account  of the  Matrix  Common
          Shareholders.   Any  Tax  refunds   allocable  to  the  Matrix  Common
          Shareholders  under this Section  7.19(f)  shall be payable by Denbury
          under the indemnity  provisions  of Section  8.03,  and subject to the
          same limitations on Denbury's indemnification obligations as set forth
          in Section 8.04.

               (ii) If an audit  adjustment,  claim for refund or amended return
          ("Adjustment")  after  the  date  hereof  shall  both  increase  a Tax
          liability  which is allocated to the Matrix  Common  Shareholders  (or
          reduce losses or credits  otherwise  available) for a Tax period (or a
          portion   thereof)   ending  on  or  before   the   Closing   Date  (a
          "Pre-Agreement Tax Increase") and decrease a Tax liability of Denbury,
          Matrix or any Affiliate for a Tax period ending after the date of this
          Agreement,  then,  when and to the extent that Denbury,  Matrix or any
          Affiliate derives a benefit from such decrease (through a reduction of
          Taxes,  refund  of  Taxes  paid or  credit  against  Taxes  due),  the
          Pre-Agreement  Tax Increase shall not be  indemnifiable  by the Matrix
          Common Shareholders to the extent of such refund, reduction or credit.
          Similarly,  if an Adjustment shall both decrease a Tax liability which
          is allocated to the Matrix Common  Shareholders for a period ending on
          or before the date of this Agreement and increase the Tax liability of
          Denbury, Matrix or an Affiliate (or reduce losses or credits otherwise
          available)  for a period ending after the date of this  Agreement then
          to the extent of such increase,  the Matrix Common  Shareholders shall
          indemnify Denbury pursuant to the terms of Article VIII.

               (iii) Any  estimated  Taxes  paid on or  before  the date of this
          Agreement  that  result  in the  total  Taxes  paid by  Matrix  or its
          Subsidiaries  (including estimated Taxes paid) to exceed the Taxes due
          and payable with respect to periods or portions thereof that end on or
          before March 31, 2001,  shall be for the account of the Matrix  Common
          Shareholders.  The Matrix Common  Shareholders  shall provide  Denbury
          with a statement (with which the Matrix Common  Shareholders will make
          available supporting schedules and information)  certifying the amount



                                       63

<PAGE>


          of any such  excess  and such  amounts  shall be treated as payable by
          Denbury under the indemnity provisions of Section 8.03, and subject to
          the same limitations on Denbury's  indemnification  obligations as set
          forth in Section 8.04.

          (g) Contests

               (i) After the Closing,  Denbury shall promptly  notify the Matrix
          Common Shareholders in writing of the commencement of any Tax audit or
          administrative  or  judicial  proceeding  or of any demand or claim on
          Denbury, Matrix or any Affiliate which, if determined adversely to the
          taxpayer   or  after  the  lapse  of  time,   would  be  grounds   for
          indemnification by the Matrix Common  Shareholders.  Such notice shall
          contain   factual   information  (to  the  extent  known  to  Denbury)
          describing  the asserted Tax liability in reasonable  detail and shall
          include  copies of any  notice  or other  document  received  from any
          Taxing  authority in respect of any such  asserted Tax  liability.  If
          Denbury fails to give the Matrix Common  Shareholders prompt notice of
          an asserted Tax liability,  then (i) if the Matrix Common Shareholders
          are precluded by the failure to give prompt notice from contesting the
          asserted Tax liability in both the administrative and judicial forums,
          the  Matrix  Common  Shareholders  shall  not have any  obligation  to
          indemnify  for any an increase  in a Tax  liability  allocable  to the
          Matrix Common Shareholders as a result of such proceeding, and (ii) if
          the Matrix Common  Shareholders  are not so precluded from contesting,
          but such failure to give prompt  notice  results in an increase in the
          Tax liability  allocable to the Matrix Common Shareholders as a result
          of  such   proceeding   then  any  amount  which  the  Matrix   Common
          Shareholders  are  otherwise  required to pay Denbury  with respect to
          such liability  shall be reduced by the amount of such increase in the
          Tax liability allocable to the Matrix Common Shareholders that was the
          result of Denbury's failure to give prompt notice to the Matrix Common
          Shareholders.  The failure to give such notice on a timely basis shall
          not affect the  indemnification  provisions  provided herein except to
          the extent the Matrix Common  Shareholders  demonstrate they have been
          actually  prejudiced  as a result of such  failure and such  prejudice
          resulted in an increase in the Tax  liability  allocable to the Matrix
          Common Shareholders.

               (ii) Except as otherwise  provided  herein,  Denbury shall direct
          any audit, claim or refund and  administrative or judicial  proceeding
          involving any asserted Tax liability regarding Matrix (any such audit,
          claim for refund or  proceeding  relating to an asserted Tax liability
          are referred to herein collectively as a "Contest"). The Matrix Common
          Shareholders  may  elect to  direct,  through  counsel  of  their  own
          choosing and at their own expense, any Contest of a Pre-Closing Return
          involving any asserted  liability with respect to which  indemnity may
          be sought from the Matrix  Common  Shareholders.  If the Matrix Common
          Shareholders  elect to direct the Contest of an asserted Tax liability
          of a Pre-Closing  Return, they shall, within thirty (30) calendar days
          of receipt of the notice of asserted Tax liability,  notify Denbury of
          their  intent to do so and  Denbury  shall  cooperate  and shall cause
          Matrix and  Subsidiaries to cooperate,  in each phase of such Contest.
          If the Matrix Common  Shareholders  do not elect to direct the Contest
          of an asserted Tax liability of a Pre- Closing Return,  fail to notify
          Denbury  of their  election  as  herein  provided,  or  contest  their
          indemnification obligation, Denbury may pay, compromise or contest, at
          its expense,  such asserted liability.  Neither Denbury nor the Matrix

                                       63

<PAGE>


          Common Shareholders may settle or compromise any Contest involving any
          asserted  liability with respect to which indemnity may be sought from
          the Matrix Common  Shareholders  over the objection of the parties not
          directing the Contest,  provided,  however, that consent to settlement
          or compromise shall not be unreasonably  withheld.  In any event, both
          Denbury and the Matrix Common  Shareholders may participate,  at their
          own expense,  in any Contest  involving an asserted Tax liability with
          respect  to which  indemnity  may be  sought  from the  Matrix  Common
          Shareholders.

          (h)  Conveyance  Taxes.  All sales,  transfer,  stamp,  real  property
     transfer or gain and similar Taxes incurred as a result of the  disposition
     of Matrix  Common  Stock or Matrix  Preferred  Stock  contemplated  by this
     Agreement,  if any,  shall be borne 50% by Denbury  and 50% by Matrix.  Any
     taxes  allocated to Matrix under this Section  7.19(h)  shall be treated as
     payable under the indemnity provisions of Section 8.02.

          (i)  Payments  made  pursuant to this Section 7.19 shall be subject to
     the provisions of Article VIII.

     Section   7.20.   Shareholder   Loan   Repayment.   At  the  Closing,   and
notwithstanding  any  disclosure  set  forth  in  Section  3.15  of  the  Matrix
Disclosure  Schedule,  the employees of Matrix  identified  under the disclosure
labeled  "Shareholder  Loan  Forgiveness"  in said  Section  3.15 shall repay to
Matrix all principal and interest  outstanding  on the loans from Matrix to such
employees.



                                  ARTICLE VIII
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

     The Matrix Common Shareholders,  severally on the one hand, and Denbury and
the Merger Sub, severally on the other hand, each make the following covenants:

     Section 8.01.  Indemnification  of Matrix  Directors  and Officers.  Unless
otherwise  provided,  the  indemnification  obligation set forth in this Section
8.01 is contingent upon Matrix, Denbury or the Surviving  Corporation,  prior to
or  concurrent  with the  Closing,  purchasing  a six (6) year term  prior  acts
coverage  director  and officer  insurance  policy ("D&O  Policy").  Denbury and
Merger Sub shall indemnify directors,  officers,  employees and agents of Matrix
to the extent that  indemnification  is mandatory under Section 83B of the LBCL.
To the extent that  indemnification  is permissive under Section 83 of the LBCL,
then subject to the first sentence of this Section 8.01,  Denbury and Merger Sub
covenant  and agree that they,  jointly  and  severally,  will  indemnify  those
directors and officers of Matrix who are covered by the D&O Policy,  but only to
the  extent  that the D&O  Policy  covers,  and  proceeds  of the D&O Policy are
actually,  or but for deductibles would have been, received with respect to, the
expenses,  judgements,  fines and amounts  paid in  settlement,  and only to the
extent that such  indemnification is permitted under Section 83 of the LBCL, and




                                       64

<PAGE>



the  Bylaws  of  Matrix,  as in  effect  on the  date  of  this  Agreement.  The
indemnification  obligations  of Denbury and Merger Sub under this  Section 8.01
are separate and  independent of the  indemnification  obligations of the Matrix
Common Shareholders under Section 8.02,  notwithstanding that matters covered by
the  indemnification  obligations  under this Section 8.01,  and amounts paid in
satisfaction  of the  indemnification  obligations  under this Section 8.01, may
give rise to indemnification obligations under Section 8.02.

     Section 8.02. Indemnification by the Matrix Common Shareholders. The Matrix
Common  Shareholders  covenant and agree that they,  severally,  will indemnify,
defend,  protect  and hold  harmless  Denbury  and the  Merger  Sub,  and  their
respective officers, directors, employees, stockholders, agents, representatives
and Affiliates,  at all times from and after the date of this Agreement from and
against all claims,  damages (including  incidental and consequential  damages),
actions,  suits,  proceedings,   demands,  assessments,   adjustments,   losses,
liabilities,  (including  Additional  Matrix  Pre-Closing  Taxes and  Additional
Matrix  Straddle Taxes)  diminutions of value,  costs,  and expenses  (including
specifically, but without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses of
investigation)  whether  or not  involving  a third  party  claim  (collectively
"Damages")  incurred  by any such  indemnified  party as a result of or  arising
directly  or  indirectly  from  or in  connection  with  (i) any  breach  of the
representations  and warranties of Matrix and the Matrix Common Shareholders set
forth herein or in the Matrix Disclosure  Schedule or certificates  delivered in
connection  herewith,  (ii) any  breach or  nonfulfillment  of any  covenant  or
agreement on the part of the Matrix  Shareholders or Matrix under this Agreement
(including, but not limited to, indemnification  obligations set forth elsewhere
in this Agreement),  and (iii) any gross up payment described in Section 3.10(l)
as a result of any excise tax under Code Section 4999, provided,  however,  that
each  Matrix  Shareholder  shall  provide  the  indemnity  set forth  herein for
breaches of the  representations  and  warranties in Sections 3.04 and 3.18, and
the representations and warranties  regarding such Matrix  Shareholder's  record
ownership  of the Matrix  Common Stock and Matrix  Preferred  Stock set forth in
Section  3.03,  only with respect to his own breaches or the breaches of Matrix.
Damages based on a breach of representations and warranties in Section 3.12 will
be set by an independent  third party mutually  agreed to by the parties hereto.
Any  circumstance  or condition  that is the basis of a Defect  identified  in a
Defect  Notice may not be used as a basis for a claim for  indemnification.  The
Defect  Basket will not be taken into  account when  determining  whether or not
Damages subject to the  indemnification  obligations in this Section 8.02 Exceed
the Basket.

     Section 8.03. Indemnification by Denbury and Merger Sub. Denbury and Merger
Sub covenant and agree that they, jointly and severally, will indemnify, defend,
protect and hold harmless the Matrix Shareholders and their respective officers,
directors, employees,  stockholders,  agents, representatives and Affiliates, at
all times from and after the date of this Agreement from and against all claims,
damages  (including  incidental and consequential  damages),  accidents,  suits,
proceedings, demands, assessments, adjustments, losses, liabilities, diminutions
of value, costs and expenses  (including  specifically,  but without limitation,
reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and  expenses  of  investigation)  whether  or not
involving a third party claim  (collectively  "Damages")  incurred by the Matrix
Shareholders  as a  result  of or  arising  directly  or  indirectly  from or in
connection with (i) any breach of the  representations and warranties of Denbury
and Merger  Sub set forth  herein or in  certificates  delivered  in  connection
herewith,  and (ii) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on
the part of Denbury or Merger Sub under this Agreement.

     Section 8.04. Limitations upon Indemnity.  The indemnification  obligations
of the Matrix Common Shareholders on the one hand, and of Denbury and the Merger
Sub on the other hand,  under the  provisions  of this  Article  VIII,  shall be
limited  as to amount so as to apply only after the amount of, and to the extent
that,  Damages  of  the  party  to be  indemnified  exceed,  in  the  aggregate,
$3,000,000  (herein  referred  to  as  "Exceed  the  Basket").   Further,   such
indemnification  obligations  are limited as to time to apply only to Damages of
the  party to be  indemnified  with  respect  to  which  notice  of a claim  for
indemnification  is  given to the  indemnifying  party on or  before  the  first
anniversary of the Closing Date, provided that the  indemnification  obligations
of the Matrix Common  Shareholders for Damages of Denbury or the Merger Sub that
results from breaches of the representations and warranties made in Section 3.12
apply to damages with respect to which notice of a claim for  indemnification is
given on or  before  548  days  after  the  Closing  Date.  For the  purpose  of
determining  whether or not  Damages  of  Denbury  and the Merger Sub Exceed the
Basket,  Damages shall include claims,  damages,  actions,  suits,  proceedings,
demands, assessments,  adjustments,  losses, liabilities,  diminutions of value,
costs and  expenses  incurred  by Denbury or the Merger Sub under  circumstances
that  constitute  a breach of a  representation  or  warranty  of Matrix and the
Matrix Common Shareholders,  or that would have constituted such a breach if the
representation  or warranty  were not  qualified by the term  "material"  or any
variation thereof. In addition to the limitation as to amount of indemnification
set forth above,  indemnification  obligations of the Matrix Common Shareholders
on the one hand,  and  Denbury  and the Merger Sub on the other  hand,  shall be
limited as to amount,  in the  aggregate  to  $15,000,000,  the  indemnification
obligations  of the  EnCap  Shareholders  shall be  limited  as to amount in the
aggregate to  $9,000,000,  and as to any  specific  matter for which a claim for
indemnification  is made to 60% of the Damages  arising out of such matter,  and
the indemnification obligations of all other Matrix Common Shareholders shall be
limited as to amount in the  aggregate  to  $6,000,000,  and as to any  specific
matter  for  which a claim  for  indemnification  is made to 40% of the  Damages
arising out of such matter, and the  indemnification  obligations of each of the
Matrix Common  Shareholders other than the EnCap Shareholders and Robin R. Mingo
shall be further limited as to amount in the aggregate to the same percentage of
$15,000,000 as the percentage  that such Matrix Common  Shareholder's  shares of
Matrix Common Stock  represents of all issued and  outstanding  shares of Matrix
Common Stock (the "Indemnification  Percentage"),  and as to any specific matter
for  which  a  claim  for   indemnification   is  made  to  such  Matrix  Common
Shareholder's  Indemnification  Percentage  of the  Damages  arising out of such
matter.  Notwithstanding the limitations as to time of indemnification set forth
above, the indemnification obligations of Denbury related to breaches of Section
7.18(a) shall not be limited as to time.

     Section 8.05. Tax Aspects of Indemnification.

          (a) If the  amount  with  respect to which any claim is made under the
     indemnity  provisions of Article VIII gives rise to a currently  realizable
     Tax  Benefit to the party  making the  claim,  the amount of the  indemnity
     claim  shall be reduced by the amount of the Tax Benefit  available  to the
     party making the claim.  To the extent such  indemnity  claim does not give
     rise to a currently,  realizable Tax Benefit, if the amount with respect to
     which any indemnity claim is made gives rise to a subsequently realized Tax
     Benefit to the party that made the claim,  such party  shall  refund (or in
     the case of indemnity claim amounts  charged  against the Holdback,  adjust
     the amount of the  Holdback) to the  indemnifying  party the amount of such
     Tax Benefit when, as, and if realized. For purposes of this  Agreement, any



                                       66

<PAGE>



     subsequently  realized  Tax  Benefit  shall be  treated as though it were a
     reduction in the amount of the initial  indemnity claim and the liabilities
     of the parties shall be redetermined as though both occurred at or prior to
     the time of the indemnity  payment or credit.  For purposes of this Section
     8.05(a),  a "Tax Benefit" means an amount by which the Tax liability of the
     party (or group of corporations including the party) is reduced (including,
     without  limitation,  by  deduction,  reduction  of  income  by  virtue  of
     increased  tax  basis  or  otherwise,  entitlement  to  refund,  credit  or
     otherwise)  plus any related  interest  received  from the relevant  taxing
     authority.  Where a party has other  losses,  deduction,  credits  or items
     available  to it, the Tax Benefit  from any losses,  deduction,  credits or
     items relating to the indemnity  claims shall be deemed to be realized only
     after the utilization of such other losses,  deductions,  credits or items.
     For  purposes  of  this  Section  8.05(a),  a  Tax  Benefit  is  "currently
     realizable"  to the extent it can be reasonably  anticipated  that such Tax
     Benefit  will be realized in the current  taxable  period or year or in any
     Tax Return with respect thereto  (including  through a carryback to a prior
     taxable  period) or in any taxable  period or year prior to the date of the
     indemnity  claim.  In  the  event  that  there  should  be a  determination
     disallowing  the Tax  Benefit,  the  indemnifying  party shall be liable to
     refund  to the  indemnified  party  the  amount  of any  related  reduction
     previously  allowed or payments  previously made to the indemnifying  party
     pursuant to this Section 8.05(a).  The amount of the refunded  reduction or
     payment  shall be deemed a payment  under  indemnity  provisions of Article
     VIII and thus shall be paid subject to any applicable reductions under this
     Section 8.05(a).

          (b) The Matrix  Common  Shareholders  and  Denbury  agree to treat all
     payments made under the indemnity  provisions of this Agreement and for any
     misrepresentations  or  breach  of  warranties,   agreements  or  covenants
     contained  in this  Agreement,  as  adjustments  to purchase  price for Tax
     purposes.

     SECTION  8.06.  INDEMNIFICATION  DESPITE  NEGLIGENCE.  IT  IS  THE  EXPRESS
INTENTION OF THE PARTIES  HERETO THAT EACH PARTY TO BE  INDEMNIFIED  PURSUANT TO
THIS ARTICLE VIII SHALL BE  INDEMNIFIED  AND HELD  HARMLESS FROM AND AGAINST ALL
DAMAGES  AS  TO  WHICH  INDEMNITY  IS  PROVIDED  FOR  UNDER  THIS  ARTICLE  VIII
NOTWITHSTANDING  THAT ANY SUCH DAMAGES ARISE OUT OF OR RESULT FROM THE ORDINARY,
STRICT, SOLE, OR CONTRIBUTORY NEGLIGENCE OF SUCH PARTY AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
ANY OTHER PARTY  (INCLUDING  THE OTHER  PARTIES TO THIS  AGREEMENT) IS OR IS NOT
ALSO NEGLIGENT.

     Section   8.07.   Survival   of   Representations   and   Warranties.   The
representations  and warranties in this Agreement shall each survive the Closing
and shall each remain in effect  thereafter  for the period that an  indemnified
party is entitled to  indemnification  based on a breach  thereof in  accordance
with Section 8.4.

     Section 8.08. Insurance Proceeds.  Any indemnification  payment required to
be made pursuant to this  Agreement  shall be reduced by any insurance  proceeds
received by the  indemnified  party or any of its Affiliates with respect to the
item giving rise to the indemnification payment.

     Section 8.09. Procedure for  Indemnification.  Promptly after receipt by an
indemnified  party  under  Sections  8.01,  8.02,  or  8.03  of  notice  of  the
commencement of any action,  such indemnified party shall, if a claim in respect




                                       67

<PAGE>



thereof is to be made against an  indemnifying  party under such  Section,  give
written notice to the indemnifying  party of the commencement  thereof,  but the
failure  so to  notify  the  indemnifying  party  shall  not  relieve  it of any
liability  that it may have to any  indemnified  party  except to the extent the
indemnifying  party  demonstrates  that the defense of such action is prejudiced
thereby.  In case any such action shall be brought against an indemnified  party
and it shall give written notice to the  indemnifying  party of the commencement
thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to
the  extent  that it may wish,  to  assume  the  defense  thereof  with  counsel
reasonably  satisfactory to such indemnified  party. If the  indemnifying  party
elects to assume the defense of such action,  the  indemnified  party shall have
the right to employ  separate  counsel at its own expense and to  participate in
the defense thereof. If the indemnifying party elects not to assume (or fails to
assume) the defense of such action,  the indemnified  party shall be entitled to
assume the defense of such action with counsel of its own choice, at the expense
of  the  indemnifying  party.  If  the  action  is  asserted  against  both  the
indemnifying  party  and the  indemnified  party  and  there  is a  conflict  of
interests which renders it inappropriate  for the same counsel to represent both
the indemnifying  party and the indemnified  party, the indemnifying party shall
be  responsible  for paying for  separate  counsel  for the  indemnified  party;
provided,  however,  that if  there  is more  than one  indemnified  party,  the
indemnifying  party  shall  not be  responsible  for  paying  for more  than one
separate firm of attorneys to represent the indemnified  parties,  regardless of
the number of indemnified  parties.  If the indemnifying  party elects to assume
the defense of such  action,  (a) no  compromise  or  settlement  thereof may be
effected by the  indemnifying  party  without the  indemnified  party's  written
consent  (which  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld)  unless  the sole  relief
provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the indemnifying party and
(b)  the  indemnifying  party  shall  have  no  liability  with  respect  to any
compromise or settlement  thereof  effected  without its written  consent (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld).



                                   ARTICLE IX
                               CLOSING CONDITIONS

     Section 9.01.  Conditions to  Obligations  of Denbury.  The  obligations of
Denbury to effect the Merger  and the other  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  are subject to the following  conditions  (any or all of which may be
waived by Denbury in writing, in whole or in part):

          (a) Securities  Laws  Compliance.  On or before the Closing Date, each
     holder of Matrix  Common  Stock  will  execute an  Investor  Representation
     Letter in a form  reasonably  acceptable  to Denbury and Denbury shall have
     determined  based  on the  representations  in that  letter  and any  other
     considerations it deems relevant, in its sole discretion,  that such holder
     of  Matrix  Common  Stock  is  an  "accredited  investor,"  as  defined  in
     Regulation  D,  or  that  each   investor  who  is  not   accredited  is  a
     "sophisticated  investor" as defined in  Regulation D and that an exemption
     from  registration  under  the  Securities  Act  and any  applicable  state
     securities  laws is available  for the issuance of Denbury  Common Stock in
     the Merger.

          (b)  Representations  and Warranties.  Each of the representations and
     warranties of Matrix and the Matrix Common  Shareholders  contained in this




                                       68

<PAGE>



     Agreement shall have been true and correct in all material  respects at and
     as of the date made and,  except either (i) as contemplated or permitted by
     this Agreement,  or (ii) to the extent that a breach of such representation
     or warranty is made the basis of a Defect,  at and as of the Effective Time
     as if  made  at  and  as of  such  time.  Denbury  shall  have  received  a
     certificate of the President and the Chief Executive  Officer of Matrix, in
     his capacity as such,  dated the Closing  Date,  to the effect that each of
     the  representations  and warranties of Matrix  contained in this Agreement
     were true and  correct in all  material  respects  as of the date made and,
     except (i) either as contemplated  or permitted by this Agreement,  or (ii)
     to the extent that a breach of such  representation or warranty is made the
     basis of a Defect,  at and as of the Effective Time as if made at and as of
     such time.

          (c) Agreements and Covenants.  Matrix shall have performed or complied
     in all material respects with all agreements and covenants required by this
     Agreement  to be  performed  or  complied  with  by it at or  prior  to the
     Effective Time.  Denbury shall have received a certificate of the President
     and the Chief Executive  Officer of Matrix,  in his capacity as such, dated
     the Closing Date, to such effect.

          (d) Consents. All Consents,  authorizations,  orders and approvals of,
     or filings or  registrations  with,  any  Governmental  Entity  required in
     connection  with the execution,  delivery and performance of this Agreement
     shall have been  obtained or made,  except for filings  required  under the
     DGCL and the  LBCL in  connection  with the  Merger,  or  filings  with the
     Minerals Management Service,  the Louisiana Department of Natural Resources
     and other  Governmental  Entities  and in  various  real  property  records
     (unless Denbury  determines that such filings need not be made prior to the
     Closing),  and Matrix  shall have  obtained all  Consents,  authorizations,
     waivers  and  approvals  required  from third  parties  required  under all
     material  agreements and instruments,  or under agreements noted in Section
     3.05 of the  Matrix  Disclosure  Schedule,  by reason of the Merger and the
     consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (e) No  Governmental  Proceedings  or  Litigation.  There shall not be
     pending or threatened any action, proceeding,  claim or counterclaim by any
     Governmental  Entity  or by any  third  party  which  seeks to or would (i)
     prohibit or restrict  the  consummation  of the  Merger,  (ii)  require the
     disposition  of or the  holding  separate  of any of the stock or assets of
     Matrix or its Subsidiaries or impose material limitations on the ability of
     Denbury  to  control  in any  material  respect  the  business,  assets  or
     operations of either  Denbury or Matrix,  or (iii) have a material  adverse
     effect on Denbury's or Matrix's  business or materially  impair the ability
     of  Matrix  and  the  Matrix  Shareholders  to  perform  their  obligations
     hereunder.  There  shall not be in effect any order,  decree or  injunction
     (whether  preliminary,  final or  appealable) of a United States Federal or
     state court of competent  jurisdiction,  and no statute, rule or regulation
     shall have been enacted or promulgated by any  Governmental  Entity,  which
     (i) prohibits or restricts  consummation of the Merger or the  transactions
     contemplated  hereby,  (ii) requires Denbury to hold separate or dispose of
     any of the  stock or  assets  of  Matrix  or its  subsidiaries  or  imposes
     material  limitations  on the ability of Denbury to control in any material
     respect the business,  assets or operations of either  Denbury or Matrix or
     (iii) has a material adverse effect on the business of Denbury or on Matrix
     and its  subsidiaries  or  materially  impairs  the  ability  of Denbury to
     perform its obligations hereunder.



                                       69

          (f) Tax Opinion.  Denbury  shall have  received an opinion dated as of
     the Closing Date from Jenkens & Gilchrist, a Professional  Corporation,  in
     form and substance  reasonably  satisfactory  to Denbury to the effect that
     the Merger will constitute a  reorganization  within the meaning of Section
     368(a) of the Code.  The issuance of such opinion shall be  conditioned  on
     the  receipt by such tax  counsel of  representation  letters  from each of
     Denbury,  Merger  Sub,  Matrix and the Matrix  Shareholders.  The  specific
     provisions  of each  such  representation  letter  shall be in the form and
     substance   reasonably   satisfactory   to  such  tax  counsel,   and  such
     representation  letter  shall be dated as of the date of such  opinion  and
     shall not have been withdrawn or modified in any material respect.

          (g) Legal  Opinion.  Denbury shall have received  legal  opinions from
     Liskow & Lewis and from  Thompson & Knight  LLP,  in the form and  covering
     such matters as shall be agreed to between the parties.

          (h)  Shareholder  Participation.  The holders of all of the issued and
     outstanding   Matrix  Common  Stock  shall  have  become  parties  to  this
     Agreement.

          (i)  Change  in  Production.  Since  the date of this  Agreement,  the
     average  daily rate of  production  of gas from the Matrix  Properties  (as
     defined in Section 3.13(a)), viewed as a whole, and measured over each week
     (being the period  commencing at 12:01 a.m. each Sunday  morning and ending
     at 12:01 a.m. on the following Sunday morning) commencing after the date of
     this  Agreement and ending prior to the Closing Date,  has not been reduced
     below the rate of 40 Mmcf of natural gas per day net to Matrix,  other than
     changes in the ordinary course of operation  (including  shut-ins necessary
     to bring  additional  wells on line) and changes that result from variances
     in  pricing  or  availability  of  markets  for  the  oil,  gas  and  other
     hydrocarbons produced.

          (j) Release of Liens.  Matrix and its  Subsidiaries  shall execute and
     deliver to Denbury  instruments  executed by its financial  institution  or
     institutions  releasing or assigning all liens,  encumbrances  and security
     interests  burdening  the  Matrix  Properties  pursuant  to the UBC  Credit
     Facility in  consideration  for Denbury causing the obligation of Matrix to
     Union Bank of  California,  N.A.,  in its  capacity  as Agent under the UBC

     Section 11.06.  Assignment.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the  benefit  of the  parties  hereto  and their  respective  successors  and
assigns;  provided,  however, that neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests,  or  obligations  hereunder  shall be  assigned by any of the parties
hereto (by operation of law or otherwise)  without the prior written  consent of
the other parties hereto, except that a Matrix Shareholder shall be permitted to
assigns its rights, duties and obligations under Article VI in connection with a
permitted  transfer of all or any portion of its  Registrable  Securities  to an
Affiliate  thereof.  This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise.

     Section 11.07. Parties in Interest.  Other than as specifically provided in
Section  7.01,  this  Agreement  shall be binding  upon and inure  solely to the
benefit of each party hereto,  and the other parties who are  indemnified  under

implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit
or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

     Section 11.08. Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver;  Remedies  Cumulative.  No
failure or delay on the part of any party  hereto in the  exercise  of any right
hereunder  shall  impair  such  right  or be  construed  to be a waiver  of,  or

nor shall any single or partial  exercise  of any such right  preclude  other or
further exercise thereof or of any other right.

     Section  11.09.  Governing  Law. This  Agreement  shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Texas,  regardless of the

agree that the failure of any party to this  Agreement to perform the provisions
in accordance with their specific terms or to otherwise  breach such provisions,
including  its failure to take all actions as are  necessary  on its part to the
consummation of the Merger,  will cause irreparable  injury to the other parties
to this Agreement for which damages, even if available,  will not be an adequate
remedy. Accordingly,  each of the parties hereto hereby consents to the issuance
of  injunctive  relief  by  any  court  of  competent   jurisdiction  to  compel
performance  of any party's  obligations,  including  an  injunction  to prevent
breaches,  and to the  granting  by any such  court of the  remedy  of  specific
performance of the terms and conditions hereof.

     Section 11.12.  Dispute  Resolution.  Notwithstanding  any other provisions
hereof, any disputes  ("Disputes")  arising out of or relating to this Agreement
shall be governed  by the  following  procedures  in the  following  order until
finally resolved:

          (a) If a Dispute  arises out of or relates to this  Agreement,  or the
     breach  thereof,  within 30 days of receipt of written notice of a Dispute,
     the parties  hereto shall  attempt in good faith to resolve such dispute by
     negotiation among senior executives of their respective  companies who have
     authority to settle the controversy;

          (b) If the Dispute cannot be settled through such negotiations  within
     the 30 day period set forth in Subsection (a), the parties agree to attempt
     in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation within 20 days immediately
     following the 30 day period set forth in Subsection  (a) in Houston,  Texas
     under  the  Commercial   Mediation   Rules  of  the  American   Arbitration
     Association.

          (c) If the Dispute  cannot be settled by such  mediation,  the parties
     agree to submit the dispute to binding arbitration in Houston, Texas, under
     Texas state and applicable federal law upon receipt of a written demand for
     arbitration  by either of the parties  setting forth the names of the other
     party or parties. Within 15 days after such commencement,  each party shall
     select one (1) person to act as arbitrator,  and the two (2) selected shall
     select a third arbitrator within 10 days of appointment. If the arbitrators
     fail  to  select  a  third  arbitrator,   then  the  American   Arbitration
     Association  shall select the third arbitrator  (such  arbitrators that are
     selected  pursuant to this Section 11.12 shall be referred to herein as the
     "Arbitrators").  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Arbitrators shall
     have the  authority to award any remedy or relief a state or federal  court
     of the state of Texas could order or grant, including,  without limitation,
     specific performance, the awarding of compensatory damages, the issuance of
     an injunction  and other  equitable  relief,  but excluding any punitive or
     consequential damages. If the remedy sought is a monetary award, each party
     shall  simultaneously,  on the twentieth  (20th) Business Day following the
     commencement of the arbitration, propose to the Arbitrators the amount that
     party believes should be awarded, and with respect to compensatory damages,
     the  Arbitrators  shall make an award in  whichever of the two amounts they
     deem most  reasonable.  The  Arbitrators'  decision  shall be  issued  with
     findings  of fact  and  conclusions  of law and  shall  be  non-appealable.
     Notwithstanding anything in this subsection (c) to the contrary, the losing
     party in a  Dispute  hereunder  shall  pay all  reasonable  legal  fees and
     expenses   incurred  by  the  prevailing   party  in  connection  with  the
     arbitration.
