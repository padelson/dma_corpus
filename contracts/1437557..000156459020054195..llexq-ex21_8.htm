Representative shall deliver to Purchaser reasonable documentation in the
possession of Sellers or any of their Affiliates to support the items for
which adjustments are proposed or made in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
delivered by Sellers' Representative and a brief explanation of any such
adjustments and the reasons therefor. Within three (3) Business Days after
receipt of Sellers' draft Preliminary Settlement Statement, Purchaser may
deliver to Sellers' Representative a written report containing all changes
that Purchaser proposes to be made to the Preliminary Settlement Statement, if
any, together with a brief explanation of any such changes. The Preliminary
Settlement Statement, as agreed upon by the Parties, will be used to adjust
the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing; provided that if the Parties cannot
agree on all adjustments set forth in the Preliminary Settlement Statement
prior to the Closing, then any such unagreed adjustments as set forth in the
Preliminary Settlement Statement as presented by Sellers' Representative will
be used to adjust the Unadjusted Purchase Price at Closing.

 

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but no later than one
hundred and twenty (120) days following the Closing Date, Sellers'
Representative shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a draft final settlement
statement setting forth the final calculation of the Adjusted Purchase Price

As soon as reasonably practicable, but not later than the thirtieth (30th) day
following receipt of Sellers' statement hereunder, Purchaser may deliver to
Sellers' Representative a written report containing any changes that Purchaser
proposes be made in such final settlement statement, or other disputed items
with respect to such proposed final settlement statement. Any changes or items
not so specified or disputed in such written report shall be deemed waived and
Sellers' determinations with respect to all such elements of the final
settlement statement that are not noted in such report shall prevail. If
Purchaser fails to timely deliver a written report to Sellers' Representative
containing changes Purchaser proposes to be made to or disputed items
Purchaser has with respect to the final settlement statement, the final
settlement statement as delivered by Sellers' Representative will be deemed to
be correct and mutually agreed upon by the Parties, and, without limiting the
application of Section 10.1(c), will be final and binding on the Parties and
not subject to further audit or arbitration. Sellers' Representative may
deliver a written report to Purchaser during the same thirty (30) day period
reflecting any changes that Sellers propose to be made in such statement as a
result of additional information received after the statement was prepared and
such thirty (30) days period shall reset. The Parties shall undertake to agree
on the final settlement statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price no later than
thirty (30) days following Purchaser's receipt of Sellers' statement delivered
hereunder or receipt of any proposed Seller changes thereto. In the event that
the Parties cannot reach agreement as to the final settlement statement of the
Adjusted Purchase Price within such period of time, any Party may refer the
items of adjustment which are in dispute or the interpretation or effect of
this Section 2.6 to a nationally recognized independent accounting firm or
consulting firm mutually acceptable to both Purchaser and Sellers'
Representative (the "Accounting Referee"), for review and final determination
by arbitration. The Accounting Referee shall conduct the arbitration
proceedings in Houston, Texas in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the AAA, to the extent such rules do not conflict with the terms of
this Section 2.6(b). The Accounting Referee's determination shall be made
within fifteen (15) days after submission of the matters in dispute and,
without limiting the application of Section 10.1(c)

 

-31-

   

with respect to Asset Taxes, shall be final and binding on all Parties,
without right of appeal. In determining the amount of any individual disputed
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, the Accounting Referee shall be
bound by the terms of Section 2.4 and must select either the amount of such
adjustment proposed by Sellers or the amount of such adjustment proposed by
Purchaser, and not any other amount. The Accounting Referee shall act as an
expert for the limited purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of
the Adjusted Purchase Price adjustments submitted by any Party and may not
award damages, interest (except to the extent expressly provided for in this
Section 2.6) or penalties to any Party with respect to any matter. Seller and
Purchaser shall each bear its own legal fees and other costs of presenting its
case. Seller shall bear one-half and Purchaser shall bear one-half of the
fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Referee.

 

(c)Within five (5) Business Days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of

report and (ii) the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Referee

under this Section 2.6(b) for any amounts in excess of the Reserve Amount..

statement of the Adjusted Purchase Price under Section 2.6(b) by furnishing

as may be reasonably requested by Sellers to facilitate such process post-

365 Contract of (i) the proposed Cure Cost for such Contract and (ii) an
objection deadline for such non-debtor party to object to the proposed Cure
Cost. To the extent Schedule 7.3 is supplemented from time to time to include
additional 365 Contracts in accordance with Section 7.3(a) above, Sellers'
Representative shall, as promptly as is practicable, deliver written notice
(each, a "Supplemental Contract Notice" and, together with the Initial
Contract Notice, the "Contract Notices") to the counterparties to such 365
Contracts of the potential assignment of such 365 Contracts and the proposed
Cure Costs for such 365 Contracts, in substantially the same form as the
Initial Contract Notice. To the extent that any objections are received from
such non-debtor parties in response to such Contract Notices, Sellers shall
within one (1) Business Day of receipt thereof provide Purchaser with notice
of such objection and sellers shall thereafter use commercially reasonable
efforts (excluding providing any payment of Cure Costs unless funded by
Purchaser) to resolve such disputes with the applicable non-debtor party, and
all such resolutions with respect to any Assumed 365 Contract shall be
acceptable to Purchaser in its sole discretion.

 

-47-

   

(c)At any time prior to the Rejection Date, Purchaser shall have the right,
which may be exercised in Purchaser's sole discretion, to provide written
notice to Sellers' Representative to supplement or change Purchaser's election
on Schedule 7.3 in order to (i) designate any 365 Contract as an Assumed 365
Contract or (ii) designate such Assumed 365 Contract as a Rejected 365
Contract. If a 365 Contract is subject to a cure dispute or other dispute as
to the assumption or assignment of such 365 Contract or the Cure Costs with
respect thereto that has not been resolved to the mutual satisfaction of
Purchaser and Sellers prior to the Rejection Date, then the Rejection Date
shall be extended (but only with respect to such 365 Contract) to no later
than the earliest of (i) the date on which such dispute has been resolved to
the mutual satisfaction of Purchaser and Seller, (ii) the date on which such
Contract is deemed rejected by operation of Sections 365(d)(4) or 1123(b)(2)
of the Bankruptcy Code, as applicable, or (iii) the date required by the
Bankruptcy Court and set forth in the Sale Order. If Purchaser exercises its
rights under this Section 7.3(c) to designate a 365 Contract (including a
Contract that was an Assumed 365 Contract immediately before such designation)
as a Rejected 365 Contract, there shall be no change in the Unadjusted
Purchase Price as a result of such designation or change in designation.

 

(d)Purchaser shall take any actions as reasonably required to obtain prior to
Closing a finding that Purchaser has provided adequate assurance of future
performance by Purchaser of the Assumed 365 Contracts, including no later than
twenty four hours (24) hours after being declared the Winning Bidder
furnishing affidavits or other documents or information for filing with the
Bankruptcy Court for the purposes, among others, of providing necessary
assurances of performance by Purchaser under this Agreement and demonstrating
that Purchaser is a "good faith" purchaser under Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code.

 

(e)Subject to the terms of this Section 7.3, any 365 Contracts that are not
designated as Assumed 365 Contracts on Schedule 7.3 (as modified and
supplemented hereunder) shall be deemed to constitute Rejected 365 Contracts,
be deemed rejected, and shall constitute Excluded Assets for all purposes
hereof.

 

(f)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller shall
not reject any 365 Contract without the prior written consent of Purchaser in
its sole discretion; provided, however, that, after the Rejection Date,
Sellers may reject Rejected 365 Contracts without the consent of Purchaser so
long as such 365 Contracts were identified to Purchaser in writing prior to
the Rejection Date.

 

(g)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall (i) Purchaser be responsible for, or otherwise be obligated to bear or
pay, any Cure Costs as to the SCM Subject Contracts in excess of One Million
Dollars ($1,000,000) in the aggregate, after giving effect to any amounts of
Cure Costs as to the SCM Subject Contracts for which Sellers agree to
reimburse Purchaser or otherwise bear or pay or (ii) Purchaser be obligated to
enter into any agreement, amendment, settlement or any other arrangement with
respect to the SCM Subject Contracts.

 

Section 7.4Consent, Preferential Right and Tag-Along Right Notices

 

. Unless the Bankruptcy Court has entered an order approving the sale and
assignment of an Asset subject to a Consent or Required Consent, Preferential
Right or Tag-Along Right without obtaining such

 

-48-

   

Consent, Required Consent or without complying with such Preferential Right or
Tag-Along Right, promptly after the Execution Date, Sellers' Representative
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and send, or cause to be
prepared and sent, (a) notices to the holders of each of the Required Consents
and other Consents (other than Customary Consents) that are set forth on
Schedule 4.9 requesting consents and approvals to the transactions of Sellers
contemplated by this Agreement and (b) notices to the holders of any
applicable Preferential Rights and Tag-Along Rights that are set forth on
Schedule 4.9 in compliance with the terms of such rights and requesting
waivers of such rights. In attempting to identify the names and addresses of
such Persons holding such Consents, Preferential Rights or Tag-Along Rights,
Sellers shall not in any event be obligated to go beyond Sellers' own Records.
Sellers and Purchaser shall cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause such Consents, to be obtained and delivered prior to Closing and all
such Preferential Rights and Tag-Along Rights to be waived, provided that
Sellers shall not be required to make payments or undertake obligations to
obtain any such Consents. Sellers shall not be liable or obligated to
Purchaser for any Damages or liabilities related or attributable to Customary
Consents that are not obtained before, on, or after Closing. If prior to
Closing, Purchaser or Sellers discover any Consents, Required Consents,
Preferential Rights or Tag-Along Rights that are not set forth on Schedule 4.9
and are not subject to an order by the Bankruptcy Court excusing or waiving
compliance with such Consents, Required Consents, Preferential Rights or Tag-
Along Rights in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby, then such
Party shall, promptly after discovery, provide written notice to the other
Party of such Consents, Required Consents, Preferential Rights or Tag-Along
Rights, whereupon the Seller shall promptly thereafter send the notices and
requests as to such Consents, Required Consents, Preferential Rights or Tag-
Along Rights required under and in accordance with this Section 7.4, Section
7.5, and Section 7.6, as applicable.

 

Section 7.5Consents to Assignment

 

. Solely with respect to Required Consents for which the Bankruptcy Court has
not entered an order approving the sale and assignment of an Asset subject to
such Required Consent without obtaining such Required Consent:

 

(a)In cases in which the Asset subject to an unobtained Required Consent is an
Asset other than an Oil and Gas Property, and Purchaser is assigned the Oil
and Gas Property or Oil and Gas Properties to which such Asset relates, but
such Asset is not transferred to Purchaser due to the unobtained Required
Consent, the Parties shall continue after Closing and up to the Cut-Off Date
to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the Required Consent so that
such Asset can be transferred to Purchaser upon receipt of the Required
Consent, and, if permitted pursuant to applicable Law and agreement, such
Asset shall be held by the applicable Seller for the benefit of Purchaser
until the Cut-Off Date, Purchaser shall be entitled to all rights thereto and
assume all of the Assumed Obligations associated therewith with respect
thereto, and Purchaser shall be responsible for the performance of any Assumed
Obligations and Damages under or with respect to such Asset to the extent that
Purchaser has been transferred the Assets necessary to such performance until
the applicable Required Consent is obtained.

 

(b)In cases in which the Asset subject to a Required Consent requirement is an
Oil and Gas Property and the Required Consent is not obtained by Closing, then
Purchaser may elect to exclude the Oil and Gas Property subject to such
Required Consent (along with any other Associated Exclusion Assets related to
such Oil and Gas Property), in which event, (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price
shall be reduced by the Allocated Value of such excluded Oil and Gas

 

-49-

   

Property and Associated Exclusion Assets, (ii) such excluded Oil and Gas
Property and Associated Exclusion Assets shall be deemed to be deleted from
Exhibit A and added to Schedule 1.1(a), and (iii) such excluded Oil and Gas
Property and Associated Exclusion Assets shall constitute Excluded Assets for
all purposes hereunder. If any such Required Consent requirement with respect
to which an adjustment to the Unadjusted Purchase Price is made under Section
2.4(a) is subsequently obtained prior to the Cut-Off Date, (A) Sellers shall,
promptly after such Required Consent requirement is satisfied, convey the
applicable Oil and Gas Property and Associated Exclusion Assets to Purchaser,
(B) the Parties shall deliver all instruments and documents that would have
been required under the terms hereof to be delivered at Closing with respect
to such Oil and Gas Property and Associated Exclusion Assets, (C) Purchaser
shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the applicable Oil and Gas
Property and Associated Exclusion Assets, pay the amount of any previous
deduction from the Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable
adjustments with respect to such Oil and Gas Properties and Associated
Exclusion Assets under Section 2.4) to Sellers' Representative, and (D) such
Oil and Gas Property and Associated Exclusion Assets shall no longer be deemed
to be (1) deleted from Exhibit A, (2) added to Schedule 1.1(a), or (3)
Excluded Assets for any purposes hereunder.

 

Section 7.6Preferential Rights

 

. Solely with respect to Preferential Rights for which the Bankruptcy Court
has not entered an order approving the sale and assignment of an Asset subject
to such Preferential Right without complying with such Preferential Right:

 

(a)Any Preferential Rights must be exercised subject to all terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the successful Closing of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 9 on the terms set forth herein. The
consideration payable under this Agreement for any particular Asset for
purposes of Preferential Rights notices shall be the Allocated Value for such
Asset, adjusted as set forth herein.

 

(b)If any Preferential Right as to any Assets is validly exercised prior to
Closing, then (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of such Asset, (ii) such Assets shall be deemed to be deleted
from Exhibit A and added to Schedule 1.1(a), and (iii) such Assets shall
constitute Excluded Assets for all purposes hereunder; provided, however, in
the event the holder of any Preferential Right as to any Assets validly
exercises such Preferential Right prior to Closing but refuses or fails to
consummate the purchase of such Assets on or before the Cut-Off Date, (A)
Sellers shall promptly convey the applicable Assets to Purchaser, (B) the
Parties shall deliver all instruments and documents that would have been
required under the terms hereof to be delivered at Closing with respect to
such Assets, (C) Purchaser shall, simultaneously with the conveyance of the
applicable Assets, pay the amount of any previous deduction from the
Unadjusted Purchase Price (subject to all other applicable adjustments with
respect to such Assets under Section 2.4) to Sellers' Representative, and (D)
such Assets shall no longer be deemed to be (1) deleted from Exhibit A, (2)
added to Schedule 1.1(a), or (3) Excluded Assets for any purposes hereunder.

 

(c)Should a Third Party fail to validly exercise or waive its Preferential
Right to purchase as to any portion of the Assets prior to Closing, and the
time for exercise or waiver of such Preferential Right has not yet expired,
then (i) the Unadjusted Purchase Price shall not be reduced by the Allocated
Value of such Assets, (ii) such Assets shall be included in the Assets and
conveyed by Sellers to Purchaser at Closing, (iii) from and after Closing,
Purchaser shall be

 

-50-

   

entitled to all amounts payable by such holder in connection with such
Preferential Right, and (iv) from and after Closing, Purchaser shall comply
with, be responsible for and perform all obligations arising with or
attributable to such Preferential Right.

 

(d)Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers desire to sell all of the Assets and
would not have entered into this Agreement but for Purchaser's agreement to
purchase all of the Assets as herein provided as set forth and subject to the
terms of this Agreement and other Transaction Documents. Accordingly, it is
expressly understood and agreed that Sellers do not desire to sell to any
Person other than Purchaser any Assets subject to any Preferential Right
unless the sale of all of the Assets is consummated by the Closing Date in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the applicable
Preferential Right to purchase. In furtherance of the foregoing, Sellers'
obligation hereunder to sell its Assets subject to any Preferential Right to
any Person other than Purchaser is expressly conditioned upon the consummation
by the Closing Date of the sale of all of the Assets (other than Excluded
Assets) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, either by conveyance
to Purchaser or conveyance pursuant to an applicable Preferential Right;
provided that, nothing herein is intended or shall operate to extend or apply
any Preferential Right to any portion of such Assets which is not otherwise
burdened thereby.

 

Section 7.7Casualty and Condemnation

 

. If, after the Execution Date but prior to or on the Closing Date, any
portion of the Oil and Gas Properties are destroyed by fire, explosion, wild
well, hurricane, storm, weather events, earthquake, act of nature, civil
unrest, or similar disorder, terrorist acts, war, or any other hostilities or
other casualty or is expropriated or taken in condemnation or under right of
eminent domain (each a "Casualty Loss"), Purchaser and Sellers shall, subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the conditions to Closing set forth in
Section 8.1 and Section 8.2, nevertheless be required to proceed with Closing.
In the event of a Casualty Loss, Purchaser shall nevertheless be required to
proceed with Closing and Seller, at the Closing, shall pay to Purchaser all
sums paid to Seller by non-Affiliate third Persons by reason of such Casualty
Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets and shall assign, transfer and set
over to Purchaser or subrogate Purchaser to all of Seller's right, title and
interest (if any) in insurance claims, unpaid awards and other rights against
non-Affiliate third Persons (excluding any Damages, other than insurance
claims, of or against any member of the Seller Group) arising out of such
Casualty Loss insofar as with respect to the Assets; provided, however, that
Seller shall reserve and retain (and Purchaser shall assign to Seller) all
rights, title, interests and claims against third Persons who are not
Affiliates of Seller for the recovery of Seller's costs and expenses incurred
prior to the Closing in pursuing or asserting any such insurance claims or
other rights against such third Persons with respect to any such Casualty
Loss. 

 

Section 7.8Closing Efforts and Further Assurances

 

.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Sellers and
Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby, including by using commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause the conditions precedent of Purchaser (in the case of
Sellers) and of Sellers (in the case of Purchaser) set forth in Article 8 to
be satisfied, (ii) obtain all necessary Consents from Governmental Authorities
and make all necessary registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental Authorities and take all steps as may be necessary to avoid, or
to have terminated,

 

-51-

   

if begun, any action, suit or proceeding by any Governmental Authority by the
Target Closing Date, (iii) defend any investigations, actions, suits or
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to
avoid the entry of, or to have reversed, terminated, lifted or vacated, any
stay, temporary restraining order or other injunctive relief or order entered
by any Governmental Authority that could prevent or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iv) to the extent any legal or
structural impediment arises that would prevent, hinder, or delay the
consummation of the Transaction Documents, support and take all steps
reasonably necessary and desirable to address any such impediment and (v)
consult and negotiate in good faith with material stakeholders, and their
advisors regarding the execution of definitive documents and the
implementation of the transaction contemplated hereby; provided, however, in
no event shall Purchaser be obligated to incur any out-of-pocket cost or
expense in connection with its obligations set forth in the foregoing subparts
(iii) or (iv) or to remove any investigations, actions, suits or proceedings,
whether judicial or administrative, that may or could result in the failure of
the conditions set forth in Section 8.1(c).

 

(b)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Purchaser and
Sellers shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered from
time to time, such further instruments of conveyance and transfer, and shall
take such other actions as any Party may reasonably request, to transfer and
deliver the Assets to Purchaser, and to otherwise accomplish the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 7.9Notifications

 

. Purchaser shall notify Sellers' Representative in writing promptly after
Purchaser obtains knowledge that any representation or warranty of Seller
contained in this Agreement is, becomes, or will be untrue in any material
respect on or before the Closing Date. Sellers' Representative shall notify
Purchaser in writing promptly after Seller obtains knowledge that any
representation or warranty of Purchaser contained in this Agreement is,
becomes, or will be untrue in any material respect on or before the Closing
Date. It is understood and agreed that the delivery of any notice required
under this Section 7.9 shall not in any manner constitute a waiver by any
Party of any conditions precedent to the Closing hereunder.

 

Section 7.10Liability for Brokers' Fees

 

. Each Party hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each other
Party, any Affiliate of such other Party, and all such other Party's
stockholders, members, officers, directors, employees, agents, lenders,
advisors, representatives, accountants, attorneys and consultants from and
against any and all claims, obligations, damages, liabilities, losses, costs
and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees) arising as
a result of undertakings or agreements of any such indemnifying Party (or any
of its Affiliates) prior to Closing, for brokerage fees, finder's fees,
agent's commissions or other similar forms of compensation to an intermediary
in connection with the negotiation, execution or delivery of this Agreement or
any agreement or document contemplated hereunder.

 

Section 7.11Credit Support

 

. The Parties agree and acknowledge that except as expressly provided in this
Section 7.11, none of the Credit Support provided by or on behalf of any
member of the Seller Group in support of the obligations of any member of the
Seller Group related to the ownership or operation of the Assets shall be
included in or constitute any Assets or be transferred to the Purchaser at
Closing. At or prior to the Closing, Purchaser shall post and provide any and
all Credit Support necessary for Purchaser to own and, if applicable, operate
the

 

-52-

   

Assets. Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts (without any
obligation to spend money or undertake obligations beyond required in the
preceding sentence of this Section 7.11) to obtain the release, return, and
replacement of all Credit Support provided by or on behalf of any member of
the Seller Group in support of the obligations of any member of the Seller
Group related to the ownership or operation of the Assets, to the extent such
Credit Support is described on or referenced in Schedule 4.19, with each such
release and replacement in the form and substance satisfactory to Sellers.

. For the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the date that is
six (6) months after (a) the Closing Date in the event Closing occurs or (b)
the Termination Date in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Article 11, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates to not,
without the prior written consent of Seller, in any way directly or indirectly
solicit induce, hire, retain or attempt to hire or retain for employment any
employee of Seller or any Affiliate of Seller with whom Purchaser has had
contact or who became known to Purchaser in connection with its review of any
information provided to Purchaser by Seller or its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not prevent Purchaser from employing any such person who
contacts Purchaser on his or her own initiative without any direct or indirect
solicitation by or encouragement from Purchaser or who responds to any public
advertising for employment without any other direct or indirect solicitation.

 

Section 7.13Expenses; Filings, Certain Governmental Approvals and Removal of
Names

 

.

 

(a)Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, all expenses
incurred by Sellers in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation or execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits and Schedules
hereto and thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing, including
all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants and financial advisers employed
by Seller, shall be borne solely and entirely by Sellers, and all such
expenses incurred by Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely by
Purchaser.

 

(b)Promptly after the Closing, Purchaser shall (i) record all assignments of
Assets executed at the Closing in the records of the applicable Governmental

within forty-five (45) days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall eliminate
the names "Lilis," "Lilis Energy" and any variants thereof from the Assets
acquired pursuant to this Agreement and, except with respect to such grace
period for eliminating existing usage, shall have no right to use any logos,
trademarks, or trade names belonging to Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

-53-

   

Section 7.14Records

 

.

 

(a)On the Closing Date and for a period of thirty (30) days thereafter,
Sellers' Representative shall make available the Records that are in the
possession of Sellers for pickup or copying, as applicable, during normal
business hours, and, if requested by Purchaser, via electronic means, subject
to this Section 7.14.

 

(b)Sellers may retain, at Sellers' sole cost and expense, copies of any and
all Records. Sellers may retain the originals of those Records relating to
Asset Tax and accounting matters and provide Purchaser, at its request, with
copies of such Records (i) that pertain to Asset Tax matters solely related to
the Assets or (ii) if such Records are necessary for Purchaser to adequately
prepare Tax Returns or to contest a legal or administrative proceeding
pursuant to Article 10.

 

(c)Purchaser shall preserve and keep a copy of all Records in Purchaser's
possession for a period of at least seven (7) years after the Closing Date.
After such seven (7) year period, before Purchaser shall dispose of any such
Records, Purchaser shall give Sellers' Representative at least thirty (30)
days' Notice to such effect, and Sellers shall be given an opportunity, at
Sellers' cost and expense, to remove and retain all or any part of such
Records as Sellers' Representative may select. From and after Closing,

access to such books and records as remain in Purchaser's possession during
Purchaser's normal business hours and without unreasonable interference in
Purchaser's business, and employees of Purchaser in connection with matters
relating to the ownership or operations of the Assets on or before the Closing
Date, any Excluded Liabilities or any claims or disputes relating to this
Agreement or with any Third Parties.

 

Section 7.15Successor Operator

 

. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers cannot and do not covenant
or warrant that Purchaser (or, if applicable, Purchaser's operating Affiliate)
shall become successor operator of any Assets operated by any Seller or its
Affiliates because such Assets may be subject to operating or other agreements
that control the appointment of a successor operator. Sellers agree, however,
that as to Assets any Seller or its Affiliate operates, Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to have Purchaser (or, if applicable,
Purchaser's operating Affiliate) designated or appointed (to the extent
legally possible under applicable Law and permitted under any applicable
operating agreement) successor operator of such Assets effective as of
Closing, provided that in no event shall any Seller or any Affiliate of a
Seller be obligated to provide any consideration in connection therewith. 

 

Section 7.16Sale Order and Auction

 

.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Purchaser and Seller
acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of the Assets and assumption and
assignment of the Assumed Contracts and Assumed Obligations are subject to
Bankruptcy Court approval. Seller shall take commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) obtain entry of the Sale Order by the Bankruptcy Court and (ii)
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case, in accordance
with this Agreement and the Sale Order.

 

-54-

   

(b)Purchaser and each Seller acknowledge that (i) to obtain approval of this
Agreement and the Sale Order by the Bankruptcy Court and to satisfy such
Seller's fiduciary duties to all applicable stakeholders and creditors in
accordance with applicable Law, such Seller must demonstrate that it has taken
reasonable steps to obtain the highest or otherwise best offer possible for
the Assets, and that such demonstration shall include giving notice of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to creditors and other interested
parties as ordered by the Bankruptcy Court and, if necessary, conducting the
Auction, (ii) Purchaser must provide adequate assurance of future performance
as may be required under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to
the Assumed Contracts, and (iii) to the extent such adequate assurance of
future performance is not provided with respect to an Assumed Contract, then
such Assumed Contract will be excluded from the Assets and included in the
Excluded Assets.

 

(c)The bidding procedures to be employed with respect to this Agreement and
the Auction shall be those attached as Exhibit 1 to the Bidding Procedures
Order. Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that Sellers, including through their
representatives, are and may continue soliciting inquiries, proposals or
offers from Third Parties for the Assets (and negotiating the terms of such
proposals or offers) in connection with any alternative transaction pursuant
to the terms of the Bidding Procedures. Sellers shall have the responsibility
and obligation to respond to any inquiries or offers to purchase all or any
part of the Assets and perform any and all other acts related thereto that are
required under the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable Law or otherwise to
fulfill Sellers' fiduciary duties as a Chapter 11 debtor, including supplying
information relating to the business and the assets of Sellers to prospective
buyers;

 

(d)Nothing in this Agreement, including this Section 7.16, shall require any
director or officer of any Seller to violate their fiduciary duties to any
Seller, as applicable. No action or inaction on the part of any director or
officer of any Seller that such director or officer reasonably believes is
required by their fiduciary duties to such Seller shall be limited or
precluded by this Agreement; provided, however, that no such action or
inaction shall be deemed to prevent Purchaser from exercising any termination
rights it may have hereunder as a result of such action or inaction.

 

(e)If an Auction is conducted and Sellers do not choose Purchaser as the
Winning Bidder, but instead choose Purchaser as the Backup Bidder, (i)
Purchaser will serve as the Backup Bidder. If Purchaser is chosen as the
Backup Bidder, Purchaser will be required to keep its bid to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement (as may be amended with Purchaser's written consent
prior to or at the Auction) open and irrevocable until the Closing of the sale
of the Assets to the Winning Bidder. If the agreement with the Winning Bidder
is terminated prior to Closing, Purchaser will be deemed to be the Winning
Bidder and will forthwith consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and (ii)
all pre-Closing deadlines applicable to Purchaser hereunder as well as the
Target Closing Date shall be extended day for day to allow Purchaser
substantially the same amount of time to deliver and required items and/or
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as would have
applied if Purchaser was chosen as the Winning Bidder at the Auction; provided
that in such situation the Target Closing Date shall not be later than
December 9, 2020.

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, from
and after Closing, the express terms of this Agreement and any Transaction
Document shall contain Purchaser's (and Purchaser Group's) sole and exclusive
remedy against any member of the Seller Group and Sellers' (and Seller
Group's) sole and exclusive remedy against any member of the Purchaser Group,
in each case with respect to the negotiation, performance and consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereunder, any breach of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of any member of the Seller or Purchaser,
as applicable, contained herein, the affirmations of such representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained in the certificates delivered
by any Seller or Purchaser at Closing pursuant to Section 9.2(f) or Section
9.3(f), as applicable, or contained in any other Transaction Document
delivered hereunder by or on behalf of Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, for
the breach or failure of any Seller or Purchaser, as applicable, to perform
any warranties, covenants or agreements of such Party required to be performed
hereunder and under any Transaction Document. Except as set forth in the
preceding sentence, effective as of Closing, Purchaser shall be deemed to have
waived, released, remised and forever discharged, and shall then cause each
member of the Purchaser Group to waive, release, remise and forever discharge,
each member of the Seller Group from any and all Damages, suits, legal or
administrative proceedings, claims, demands, losses, costs, obligations,
liabilities, interest, charges or causes of action whatsoever, in law or in
equity, known or unknown, which any member of the Purchaser Group might now or
subsequently may have, based on, relating to or arising out of (i) all
avoidance, fraudulent transfer, preference or

 

-67-

   

similar claims, causes of action, rights or proceedings, including all claims
under Chapter 5 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act,
and the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act enacted by any state, or any other
similar state or Federal law, (ii) the negotiation, performance and
consummation of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the
transactions contemplated hereunder or thereunder, and/or (iii) any member of
the Seller Group's ownership, use or operation of the Assets, or the
condition, quality, status or nature of the Assets, including rights to
contribution under CERCLA or any other Environmental Law, breaches of
statutory and implied warranties, nuisance or other tort actions, rights to
punitive damages, common law rights of contribution, any rights under
insurance policies issued or underwritten by any member of the Seller Group,
even if caused in whole or in part by the negligence (whether sole, joint,
active, passive, comparative, or concurrent), strict liability or other legal
fault of any released Person, invitees or third parties, BUT, IN ALL CASES,
EXCLUDING ANY ACTUAL FRAUD CLAIMS THAT PURCHASER MAY HAVE.

 

(b)The Parties further agree that damages may not be a sufficient remedy to
any breach of the provisions of Section 2.7, Section 7.14 or Section 13.16 of
this Agreement and the non-breaching Party may be irreparably and immediately
harmed if any of such provisions of this Agreement are not performed by the
other Party or its Affiliates (as applicable) strictly in accordance with
their respective terms. In the event of a breach of any of the above listed
provisions, the non-breaching Party shall provide written notice and a demand
to cease or cure any such breach; provided, that in the event such breach (a)
is not susceptible to cure or (b) if susceptible to being cured, has not been
cured within five (5) days after delivery of such written notice thereof to
the breaching Party, the non-breaching Party shall have the right, in addition
to any other rights such Party may have, to seek injunctive relief and to
restrain any breach or any anticipated or threatened breach by the other Party
or obtain specific enforcement of such terms. Such remedy shall not be deemed
to be the exclusive remedy for such breach of this Agreement, but shall be in
addition to all of the remedies at Law or in equity available to the non-
breaching Party. 

 

(c)Any claim for indemnity under this Article 12 by any current or former
Affiliate, stockholder, member, officer, director, employee, agent, lender,
advisor, representative, accountant, attorney and consultant of any member of
the Seller Group must be brought and administered by the Seller. No member of
the Seller Group other than Seller shall have any rights against Purchaser
under the terms of this Agreement except as may be exercised on behalf of such
members of the Seller Group by Seller.

 

(d)Except for the right to termination of this Agreement prior to Closing as
expressly provided in Article 11, Purchaser and Sellers hereby waive any and
all rights to rescind, reform, cancel, terminate, revoke or void this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e)The Parties shall treat, for U.S. federal and applicable state and local
income Tax purposes, any amounts paid or received under this Article 12 as an
adjustment to the Adjusted Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by
applicable Laws.

 

-68-

   

(f)Each of Purchaser and Sellers hereby waive for itself and their respective
successors and assigns, including any insurers, any rights to subrogation for
Damages for which such Party is liable or against which such Party indemnifies
any other Person under this Agreement. If required by applicable insurance
policies, each Party shall obtain a waiver of such subrogation from its
insurers.

 

Section 12.5Indemnification Actions

 

. All claims for indemnification under Article 12 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

 

(a)To make a claim for indemnification, defense or reimbursement under this
Article 12, an Indemnified Person shall notify the Purchaser of its claim,
including the specific details (including supporting documentation in such
Indemnified Person's possession or control of the alleged Damages and such
Indemnified Person's good faith estimate of the applicable claim) of and
specific basis under this Agreement for its claim (the "Claim Notice").

 

(b)In the event that any claim for indemnification set forth in any Claim
Notice is based upon a claim by a Third Party against the Indemnified Person
(a "Third Party Claim"), the Indemnified Person shall provide its Claim Notice
promptly after the Indemnified Person has actual knowledge of the Third Party
Claim and shall enclose a copy of all papers (if any) served with respect to
the Third Party Claim in such Indemnified Person's possession or control;
provided that the failure of any Indemnified Person to give notice of any
Third Party Claim as provided in this Section 12.5 shall not relieve the
Purchaser of its obligations under this Article 12 except to the extent such
failure results in insufficient time being available to permit the Purchaser
to effectively defend against the Third Party Claim or otherwise prejudices
the Purchaser's ability to defend against the Third Party Claim.

 

(c)Subject to Section 12.5(e), in the case of a claim for indemnification
based upon any Third Party Claim, the Purchaser shall have thirty (30) days
from its receipt of the Claim Notice to notify the Indemnified Person whether
it admits or denies its obligation hereunder to defend the Indemnified Person
against such Third Party Claim under this Agreement. The Indemnified Person is
authorized, prior to and during such thirty (30) day period, to file any
motion, answer or other pleading that it shall deem necessary or appropriate
to protect its interests. If the Purchaser fails to notify the Indemnified
Person within such thirty (30) day period regarding whether the Purchaser
admits or denies its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such
Third Party Claim under this Agreement, then until such date as the Purchaser
admits or it is finally determined by a non-appealable judgment that such
right or obligation exists, the Indemnified Person may file any motion, answer
or other pleading, settle any Third Party Claim or take any other action that
the Indemnified Person deems necessary or appropriate to protect its interest,
regardless of whether the Purchaser is prejudiced or adversely impacted by any
such actions.

 

(d)If Purchaser admits its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against
such Third Party Claim under this Agreement, as applicable, then Purchaser
shall have (i) the right and obligation to diligently prosecute and control
the defense of such Third Party Claim at the sole cost and expense of
Purchaser and (ii) have full control of such defense and proceedings,
including any compromise or settlement thereof unless the compromise or
settlement includes the payment of any amount by, the performance of any
obligation by, or the limitation of any right or benefit

 

-69-

   

of, the Indemnified Person, in which event such settlement or compromise shall
not be effective without the consent of the Indemnified Person, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. If requested by the Purchaser, the
Indemnified Person agrees at the cost and expense of the Purchaser to
cooperate in contesting any Third Party Claim which the Purchaser elects to
contest; provided, however, that the Indemnified Person shall not be required
to bring any counterclaim or cross-complaint against any Person. The
Indemnified Person may participate in, but not control, any defense or
settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Purchaser pursuant to
this Section 12.5(d), provided that the Indemnified Person may file initial
pleadings as described in the last sentence of Section 12.5(c) if required by
court or procedural rules to do so within the thirty (30) day period in
Section 12.5(c). A Purchaser shall not, without the written consent of the
Indemnified Person, settle any Third Party Claim or consent to the entry of
any judgment with respect thereto that (A) does not result in a final
resolution of the Indemnified Person's liability with respect to the Third
Party Claim (including, in the case of a settlement, an unconditional written
release of the Indemnified Person from all further liability in respect of
such Third Party Claim) or (B) may materially and adversely affect the
Indemnified Person (other than as a result of money damages borne solely by
Purchaser hereunder).

 

(e)If Purchaser does not admit in writing its obligation to defend the
Indemnified Person against such Third Party Claim under this Agreement or
admits its obligation but thereafter fails to diligently defend or settle the
Third Party Claim, as applicable, then the Indemnified Person shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to defend and control the defense against the
Third Party Claim (at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser if the
Indemnified Person is entitled to indemnification hereunder), with counsel of
the Indemnified Person's choosing, subject to the right of Purchaser as the
Purchaser to admit in writing its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person
against such Third Party Claim under this Agreement, as applicable, at any
time prior to settlement or final determination thereof. If Purchaser has not
yet admitted its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such
Third Party Claim under this Agreement, the Indemnified Person shall send
written notice to the Purchaser of any proposed settlement and the Purchaser
shall have the option for ten (10) days following receipt of such notice to
admit in writing its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such
Third Party Claim under this Article 12, and if such right or obligation is so
admitted, assume the defense of the Third Party Claim, including the power to
reject the proposed settlement.

 

(f)In the case of a claim for indemnification not based upon a Third Party
Claim (a "Direct Claim"), such Direct Claim shall be asserted by giving
Purchaser a reasonably prompt Claim Notice. Such Claim Notice by the
Indemnified Person shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall
include copies of all available material written evidence in such Indemnified
Person's possession or control thereof and shall indicate the estimated
amount, if reasonably practicable, of Damages that have been or may be
sustained by the Indemnified Person. Purchaser shall have sixty (60) days from
its receipt of the Claim Notice to (i) cure the Damages complained of, (ii)
admit its obligation to defend the Indemnified Person against such Direct
Claim under this Agreement, or (iii) dispute the claim for such Damages. If
Purchaser does not notify the Indemnified Person within such sixty (60) day
period that it has cured the Damages or that it admits responsibility for the
claim for such Damages, the Purchaser shall be deemed to have disputed its
obligation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Indemnified Person
against such Direct Claim under this Agreement.

Section 12.6Express Negligence/Conspicuous Manner

 

. WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, ALL PARTIES AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS SET
OUT IN THIS ARTICLE 12 AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS AGREEMENT COMPLY WITH THE
REQUIREMENT, KNOWN AS THE EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE RULE, TO EXPRESSLY STATE IN A
CONSPICUOUS MANNER TO AFFORD FAIR AND ADEQUATE NOTICE THAT THIS AGREEMENT HAS
PROVISIONS REQUIRING PURCHASER TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE NEGLIGENCE (whether,
sole, joint, active, passive, comparative or concurrent), STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER FAULT OF MEMBERS OF THE SELLER GROUP. PURCHASER REPRESENTS TO THE SELLER
group (A) THAT PURCHASER HAS CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY CONCERNING THIS AGREEMENT
OR, IF IT HAS NOT CONSULTED AN ATTORNEY, THAT PURCHASER WAS PROVIDED THE
OPPORTUNITY AND HAD THE ABILITY TO SO CONSULT, BUT MADE AN INFORMED DECISION
NOT TO DO SO AND (B) THAT PURCHASER FULLY UNDERSTANDS ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT.

Section 13.2Governing Law

 

. Except to the extent the mandatory provisions of the Bankruptcy Code apply,
this Agreement and the documents delivered pursuant hereto and the legal
relations among the Parties shall be governed by, construed and enforced in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to principles
of conflicts of Laws that would direct the application of the Laws of another
jurisdiction.

 

Section 13.3Venue and Waiver of Jury Trial

 

.

 

(a)Except as to any dispute, controversy, matters, or claim arising out of or
in relation to or in connection with the calculation or determination of the
Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.4, Section 2.5, Section 2.7, or
Section 2.8 (which shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with Section
2.6(b)), any dispute, controversy, matter or claim between or among the
Parties with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions or any Transaction
Document contemplated by hereby or thereby (each, subject to such exceptions,
a "Dispute"), that cannot be resolved among the Parties, will be instituted
exclusively in the Bankruptcy Court and each Party hereby irrevocably consents
to the exclusive jurisdiction in connection with any Dispute, litigation or
proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated thereby. All Disputes between or among the Parties to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall have exclusive
jurisdiction and venue only in the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, if the
Chapter 11 Case is closed, then each Dispute will be instituted exclusively in
the courts of the State of Texas in and for Harris County or the United States
District Court and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction in connection with any Dispute, litigation or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby. All
Disputes between or among the Parties to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue only in the
courts of the State of Texas in and for Harris County or the United States
District Court and each Party hereby irrevocably consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction in connection with any Dispute, litigation or proceeding arising
out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated thereby. Each
Party waives any objection which it may have pertaining to improper venue or
forum non-conveniens to the conduct of any litigation or proceeding in the
foregoing courts. Each

 

-72-

   

Party agrees that any and all process directed to it in any such proceeding or
litigation may be served upon it outside of the Bankruptcy Court, or, in the
event the Chapter 11 Case is closed, outside of Harris County, Texas with the
same force and effect as if such service had been made within the State of
Texas in and for Harris County or the United States District Court or the
Texas State District Court located in Houston, Texas.

 

(b)To the extent that either Party or any of its Affiliates has or hereafter
may acquire immunity from jurisdiction of any court or from any legal process
(whether through service or notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment
in aid of execution, execution or otherwise) with respect to itself or its
property, such Party (on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates)
hereby irrevocably (i) waives such immunity in respect of its obligations with
respect to this Agreement and (ii) submits to the personal jurisdiction of any
court described in Section 13.3(a). Further, each Party waives any objection
which it may have pertaining to improper venue or forum non-conveniens to the
conduct of any litigation or proceeding in the foregoing courts. Each Party
agrees that any and all process directed to it in any such proceeding or
litigation may be served upon it outside of the State of Texas in and for
Harris County or the United States District Court located in Houston, Texas
with the same force and effect as if such service had been made within Harris
County, Texas.

 

(c)The Parties agree that a dispute under this Agreement may raise issues that
are common with one or more of the other Transaction Documents or other
documents executed by the Parties in connection herewith or which are
substantially the same or interdependent and interrelated or connected with
issues raised in a related dispute, controversy, or claim between or among the
Parties and their Affiliates. Accordingly, any Party to a new Dispute under
this Agreement may elect in writing within fifteen (15) days after the
initiation of a new Dispute to refer such new Dispute for resolution by the
applicable court together with any existing Dispute arising under this
Agreement, other Transaction Documents or other documents executed by the
Parties in connection herewith or which are substantially the same or
interdependent and interrelated or connected. If the applicable court does not
determine to consolidate such new Dispute with the existing Dispute within
thirty (30) days of receipt of written request, then the new Dispute shall not
be consolidated, and the resolution of the new Dispute shall proceed
separately.

 

(d)EACH OF THE PARTIES HEREBY VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY
IN ANY LITIGATION, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH THIS
AGREEMENT.

 

Section 13.4Headings and Construction

 

. The headings and captions herein are inserted for convenience of reference
only and are not intended to govern, limit or aid in the construction of any
term or provision hereof. The rights and obligations of each Party shall be
determined pursuant to this Agreement. Sellers and Purchaser have each had the
opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of
the details and terms of the transaction contemplated hereby. This Agreement
is the result of arm's length negotiations from equal bargaining positions. It
is the intention of the Parties that every covenant, term and provision of
this Agreement shall be construed simply according to its fair meaning and not
strictly for or against any Party (notwithstanding any rule of law requiring
an agreement to be strictly construed against the drafting Party) and no
consideration shall be given or presumption made, on the basis of who drafted
this Agreement or any particular provision thereof, it being understood that
the

 

-73-

   

Parties to this Agreement are sophisticated and have had adequate opportunity
and means to exercise business discretion in relation to the negotiation of
the details of the transaction contemplated hereby and retain counsel to
represent their interests and to otherwise negotiate the provisions of this
Agreement.

 

Section 13.5Waivers

 

. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its obligations, agreements
or conditions herein contained may be waived by the Party to whom such
compliance is owed by the application of the express terms hereof by an
instrument signed by the Party to whom compliance is owed and expressly
identified as a waiver, but not in any other manner. No course of dealing on
the part of any Party or its respective officers, employees, agents, or
representatives and no failure by any Party to exercise any of its rights
under this Agreement shall, in each case, operate as a waiver thereof or
affect in any way the right of such Party at a later time to enforce the
performance of such provision. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
no waiver of, or consent to a change in or modification of, any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of,
or consent to a change in or modification of, other provisions hereof (whether
or not similar), nor shall such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless
otherwise expressly provided herein. The rights of each Party under this
Agreement shall be cumulative and the exercise or partial exercise of any such
right shall not preclude the exercise by such Party of any other right.

 

Section 13.6Severability

 

. It is the intent of the Parties that the provisions contained in this
Agreement shall be severable and should any terms or provisions, in whole or
in part, be held invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced as a matter
of law, such holding shall not affect the other portions of this Agreement,
and such portions that are not invalid shall be given effect without the
invalid portion. Upon such determination that any term or provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

Section 13.7Assignment

 

. Except as provided in this Section 13.7, prior to Closing no Party shall
assign or otherwise transfer all or any part of this Agreement, nor shall any
Party delegate any of its rights or duties hereunder, without the prior
written consent of the other Party and any transfer or delegation made without
such consent shall be null and void. Unless expressly agreed to in writing by
the Parties, no permitted assignment of any Party's rights or duties that is
subject to the consent of the other Party shall relieve or release the
assigning Party from the performance of such Party's rights or obligations
hereunder and such assigning Party shall be fully liable to the other Party
for the performance of all such rights and duties. If a Liquidating Trust is
established, from and after the formation of the Liquidating Trust all rights
and obligations of Seller under this Agreement shall accrue to and be for the
benefit of, and shall be exercisable by, the Liquidating Trust, as provided by
any order of the Bankruptcy Court, and the Liquidating Trustee shall be
entitled to exercise all of the rights of Sellers under this Agreement.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors
and assigns.

 

Section 13.8Entire Agreement

 

. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement among the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions,
whether oral or

 

-74-

   

written, of the Parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof. IN THE EVENT
OF A CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS
AND PROVISIONS OF ANY SCHEDULE OR EXHIBIT HERETO, THE TERMS AND PROVISIONS OF
THIS AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL; PROVIDED, HOWEVER THAT THE INCLUSION
IN ANY OF THE SCHEDULES AND EXHIBITS HERETO OF TERMS AND PROVISIONS NOT
ADDRESSED IN THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT BE DEEMED A CONFLICT, AND ALL SUCH
ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS SHALL BE GIVEN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT, SUBJECT TO THE
PROVISIONS OF THIS Section 13.8.

 

Section 13.9Amendment

 

. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an agreement in writing
signed by Seller and Purchaser and expressly identified as an amendment or
modification.

 

Section 13.10No Third-Person Beneficiaries

 

. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle any Person other than Purchaser and
Seller to any claim, cause of action, remedy or right of any kind, except the
rights expressly provided to the Persons described in Section 7.1, Section
7.10, Article 12 and Section 13.11, in each case, only to the extent such
rights are exercised or pursued, if at all, by Seller or Purchaser acting on
behalf of such Person (which rights may be exercised in the sole discretion of
the applicable Party hereunder). Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) the
Parties reserve the right to amend, modify, terminate, supplement, or waive
any provision of this Agreement or this entire Agreement, in each case, as
expressly provided herein, without the consent or approval of any other Person
(including any Indemnified Person) and (b) no Party hereunder shall have any
direct liability to any permitted Third Party beneficiary, nor shall any
permitted Third Party beneficiary have any right to exercise any rights
hereunder for such Third Party beneficiary's benefit except to the extent such
rights are brought, exercised and administered by a Party hereto in accordance
with Section 12.4(b).

 

Section 13.11Non-Recourse Persons

 

. The Parties acknowledge and agree that no past, present, or future director,
manager, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney, representative, Affiliate, capital sponsor or financing source
(including, without limitation, EnCap Investments L.P., any investment fund
managed by EnCap Investments L.P. or any of their respective Affiliates, and
any of the foregoing Person's respective past, present, or future directors,
managers, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners, stockholders,
agents, attorneys, representatives, Affiliates (other than any of the
Parties), of any Seller or of Purchaser (excluding, in each case, Sellers and
Purchaser, and subject to such exclusion, each, a "Non-Recourse Person"), in
such capacity, shall have any liability or responsibility (in contract, tort,
or otherwise) for, and each Party hereby waives, releases, remises and forever
discharges, and shall cause each member of the Seller Group or Purchaser
Group, as applicable, to waive, release, remise and forever discharge, any
liabilities, suits, legal or administrative proceedings, claims, demands,
losses, costs, obligations, liabilities, interests, charges, or causes of
action whatsoever, in law or in equity, known or unknown, against each Non-
Recourse Person whom is a Non-Recourse Person due to the existence of the
other Party, in each case, which are based on, related to, or arise out of the
ownership or operation of the Assets or negotiation, performance, and
consummation of the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
thereunder. Each Non-Recourse Person is expressly intended as a third-party
beneficiary of this Section 13.11.

 

-75-

   

Section 13.12Limitation on Damages

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Person shall
be entitled to lost profits, DIMINUTION IN VALUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS
OPPORTUNITY, indirect, consequential, special, or punitive damages in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
each of Purchaser and Seller, for itself and on behalf of their respective
members of the Purchaser Group and Seller Group, respectively, hereby
expressly waives any right to lost profits, indirect, consequential, special,
or punitive damages in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, other than lost profits, dimInution in value, loss of
business opportunity, indirect, consequential, special or punitive damages
suffered by any Third Party for which responsibility is allocated among the

Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Consumer Protection Act, Subchapter E of
Chapter 17, Sections 17.41, et seq., of the Texas Business and Commerce Code,
(as amended, the "DTPA"). Purchaser covenants, for itself and for and on
behalf of any successor or assignee, that if the DTPA is applicable to this
Agreement, (a) Purchaser is a "business consumer" as that term is defined in
the DTPA, (b) AFTER CONSULTATION WITH ATTORNEYS OF PURCHASER'S OWN SELECTION,
PURCHASER HEREBY VOLUNTARILY WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL OF PURCHASER'S RIGHTS AND
REMEDIES UNDER THE DTPA AS APPLICABLE TO EACH SELLER AND SUCH SELLER'S
SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS AND (c) PURCHASER SHALL DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY THE SELLER
GROUP FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS OF OR BY ANY MEMBER OF THE PURCHASER
GROUP OR ANY OF THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS OR ANY OF ITS OR THEIR AFFILIATES
BASED IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON THE DTPA ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT.

 

Section 13.14Time of the Essence; Calculation of Time

 

. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the date specified in this
Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is not a Business Day (or
if the period during which any notice is required to be given or any action
taken expires on a date that is not a Business Day), then the date for giving
such notice or taking such action (and the expiration date of such period
during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall be the next
day that is a Business Day.

 

Section 13.15Sellers' Representative.

 

(a)Each Seller other than LEI, by executing this Agreement, irrevocably
constitutes and appoints LEI and its successors (acting in the capacity as
hereinafter provided, "Sellers' Representative") as such appointing Person's
agent and attorney-in-fact to act on behalf of such Person in connection with

Date (A) to give and receive written consents, reports, notices and
communications to or from Purchaser relating to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction

and all matters affecting such appointing Person in this Agreement, including
giving and receiving all notices and communications to be given or received
with respect to any such matters, and (C) to negotiate, compromise and resolve
any dispute that may arise under this Agreement; provided, however, that in
