THIS MERGER AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
March 16, 2016 by and among Coherent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_
"), Rembrandt Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc., a

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

"), and each share (each, a " _Share_ ," and collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company
Common Stock_ ") then outstanding will thereupon be cancelled and converted
into the right to receive $32.50 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ "), with
the unanimous recommendation of the special committee of the Company Board
(the " _Special Committee_ "), has unanimously (i) determined that this

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, as
well as other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged and accepted, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL, on the Closing Date,
Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation of the Merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent. The Company, as the surviving corporation of the Merger, is sometimes
referred to herein as the " _Surviving Corporation_." Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, on the Closing Date,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated
under the DGCL by filing a certificate of merger in customary form and
substance (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") in accordance with
the applicable provisions of the DGCL. The time of such filing and acceptance
by the Delaware Secretary of State, or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by Parent and the Company and specified in the Certificate of Merger,
is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

 



 

1.2 _The Surviving Corporation of the Merger_.

 



 

(a) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.11_,
at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall
be amended and restated in its entirety to read identically to the Certificate
of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of Incorporation
shall become the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
DGCL and such Certificate of Incorporation; _provided, however_ , that at the
Effective Time the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended so that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be
"Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc."

 



 

(ii) _Bylaws_. Subject to the terms of _Section 7.11_, at the Effective Time,
the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall become the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and such Bylaws.

 



 

(b) _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 



 

(i) _Directors_. At the Effective Time, the initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Officers_. At the Effective Time, the initial officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the officers of the Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors are duly appointed.

 



 

1.3 _General Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all
debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.4 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Merging Corporations_.

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, or the holders of any capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the
Company, each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of such
shares of common stock of Merger Sub shall thereafter evidence ownership of
shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Capital Stock of the Company_.

 



 

(i) _Generally_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any
capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, other than as otherwise
set forth in this _Section 1.4(b)_, each Share that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested or
otherwise subject to a repurchase option or obligation, risk of forfeiture or
other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or
other agreement with the Company or under which the Company has any rights)
shall be canceled and extinguished and automatically converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration upon the surrender of the Certificate
representing such Share or the transfer of such Uncertificated Share in the
manner provided in _Section 2.3(c)_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required)
in the manner provided in _Section 2.3(d)_); _provided, however_ , that the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date
hereof and prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, all
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled,
retired and cease to exist, and each holder of Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration issuable in respect thereof

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to this _Section 1.4(b)(i)_. The Merger Consideration issued upon
the surrender for exchange of Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
such Shares, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Surviving Corporation of Shares which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a
certificate representing Shares is presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, then such certificate shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 1.4(b)_.

 



 

(ii) _Owned Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, or the holders of any
capital stock of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, each Share that is owned
by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, in each case
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" _Owned Shares_ "), shall be
cancelled and extinguished without any conversion thereof or consideration
paid therefor.

 



 

(iii) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than Owned Shares) and held by a holder who has not
voted in favor of adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing
and who has properly exercised appraisal rights of such Shares in accordance
with Section 262 of the DGCL (such Shares being referred to collectively as
the " _Dissenting Shares_ " until such time as such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders appraisal rights under Delaware Law
with respect to such Shares) shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration but instead shall be entitled to payment of the fair
value of such Shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided,
however_ , that if, after the Effective Time, such holder fails to perfect,
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL, or if a court of competent jurisdiction shall
determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section
262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
accordance with _Section 1.4(b)(i)_, without interest thereon, upon surrender
of such Certificate formerly representing such Share or transfer of such
Uncertificated Share, as the case may be. The Company shall provide Parent
prompt written notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of any such demand and any
other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to Delaware Law that relates to such demand, and
Parent shall have the opportunity and right to participate in and direct all
negotiations and Legal Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with
the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment
with respect to, or offer to settle or settle, any such demands.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Company Options._

 



 

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Company Option
listed on _Schedule 1.4(c)(i)_ that has not yet become vested in accordance
with its terms will thereupon become fully vested, provided that the holder of
such Company Option is then still employed by or in the service of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall be canceled in exchange for the right to
receive a cash payment from the Company or Parent equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock covered by the vested portion of such Company
Option (taking into account any accelerated vesting immediately prior to the
Effective Time) multiplied by the excess of the Merger Consideration over the
option exercise price per share of such Company Option.

 



 

(ii) Unless otherwise agreed by Parent in its sole discretion, at the
Effective Time, each Company Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is not entitled to receive a cash payment pursuant to
_Section 1.4(c)(i)_ (whether vested or unvested) shall, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, be assumed
by Parent and converted into an option (a " _Parent Option_ ") to acquire (i)
that number of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent
(the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (rounded down to the nearest whole share)
equal to the product obtained by multiplying (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, and (ii) at an exercise price
per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal
to the quotient obtained by dividing (A) the exercise price per share of

(a) _Payment Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall select a
bank or trust company, reasonably acceptable to the Company, to act as the
payment agent for the Merger (the " _Payment Agent_ ").

 



 

(b) _Payment Fund_.

 



 

(i) _Creation of Payment Fund_. On the Closing Date, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Payment Agent,
for payment to the holders of Shares pursuant to the provisions of _Article
I_, an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
Merger Consideration by (y) the aggregate number of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding Owned Shares
and

 



      
 

 



 

Dissenting Shares) (such cash amount being referred to herein as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). From time to time following the Effective Time as required,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall deposit (or cause to be deposited)
with the Payment Agent additional cash in any amount necessary to enable the
Payment Agent to pay any and all Merger Consideration payable hereunder, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall in any event be liable for the
payment thereof. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose,
including the payment of all charges and expenses, including those of the
Payment Agent, in connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger
Consideration, which shall be the sole responsibility of Parent and the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(ii) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Shares on the date that is one (1)
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand, and any holders of Shares that were issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Merger who have not theretofore exchanged their
Shares for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of _Section
1.4(b)_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws), solely as general
creditors thereof, for any payment of and claim to the applicable Merger
Consideration to which such holders may be entitled pursuant to the provisions
of _Article I_. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of the Shares two
(2) years after the Effective Time, or at such earlier date as is immediately
prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become
property of, any Governmental Authority, will become, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear
of any claims or interest of any such holders (and their successors, assigns
or personal representatives) previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares as of immediately prior to the Effective Time: (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares
(excluding Owned Shares and Dissenting Shares) (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or transfer of non-certificated Shares (excluding Owned
Shares and Dissenting Shares) represented by book entry (" _Uncertificated
Shares_ ") to the Payment Agent); and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to
the provisions of _Article I_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a
Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (x) surrender to the Payment Agent
of a Certificate, together with a duly completed and validly executed letter
of transmittal and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Payment Agent, or (y) receipt of an "agents message" by the Payment Agent (or
such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Payment Agent may reasonably
request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares. Until
so surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, from and after the
Effective Time each such Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall represent
for all purposes only the right to receive the

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of
_Article I_. If Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration as provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth in _Article I_. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Share. From and after the Effective Time, there
will be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of Shares that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than transfers to reflect, in accordance with
customary settlement procedures, trades effected prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration issuable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 1.4(b)(i)_;
_provided, however_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in its discretion
and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent with respect to the
Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

(e) _Transferred Shares_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Payment Agent any transfer or other
similar Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to
the satisfaction of the Payment Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 



 

(f) _Tax Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under Applicable Law. To the extent that such amounts are
so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Shares for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law.

3.1 _Organization and Standing_. The Company is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under Delaware Law. The Company has the
requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is
presently being conducted and to own, lease or operate its properties and
assets. The Company is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned or leased or
the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary (to the extent
the "good standing" concept is applicable in the case of any jurisdiction
outside the United States), except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company is not in violation of its certificate of
incorporation or bylaws, true and correct copies of which are filed as
exhibits to the SEC Reports.

 



 

3.2 _Authorization and Enforceability_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject in the case of the Merger to obtaining the
Requisite Stockholder Approval, to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and to perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company, the performance by the Company of its covenants
and obligations hereunder and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and
no additional corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary
to authorize this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger), other than in the case of the
Merger obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval.

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and Merger
Sub, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

 



      
 

 



 

reorganization, moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting or
relating to creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(collectively, the " _Enforceability Limitations_ ").

Agreement, the Company Board, with the unanimous recommendation of the Special
Committee, unanimously (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, are advisable, (ii) determined that

Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting and (vi) resolved to
recommend that the holders of Shares adopt this Agreement in accordance with
the applicable provisions of Delaware Law.

price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-
takeover statute or regulation under the laws of the State of Delaware or
other Applicable Law (each, a " _Takeover Statute_ ") is applicable to Parent,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Voting Agreements.

 



 

(e) The Company Board has received the opinion of Greenhill and Co., LLC to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based upon and subject to the
limitations, qualifications and assumptions set forth therein, the Merger
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Company Common Stock (other than Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries), and as of
the date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or
modified. A signed copy of such opinion will be made available to Parent, for
informational purposes only, promptly after the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by each of the parties hereto.

 



 

(f) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth in
_Section 4.5_, the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the
outstanding Shares entitled to vote at a meeting of the holders of Company
Common Stock called to consider the Merger (the " _Requisite Stockholder
Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of Company Common Stock necessary
(under Applicable Law, the Companys organizational documents or otherwise) to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

authorization of, or filing or registration with, or notification to (any of

applicable requirements of the HSR Act and other applicable Antitrust Laws,
and (d) such other Consents the failure of which to obtain would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

3.4 _No Conflicts_. The execution, delivery or performance by the Company of
this Agreement, the consummation by the Company of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) and the compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions hereof do not and will not (i) subject to obtaining
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, violate or conflict with any provision of
the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other constituent documents of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) subject to obtaining the Consents
set forth in _Section 3.3_, violate, conflict with, or result in the breach

accelerate the performance required by, or result in a right of termination or
acceleration under, or result in the loss of any material benefit or the
imposition of any additional payment or other Liability under, any Contract,

upon any of the properties or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, except in the case of each of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv)

Adverse Effect.

Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock of, or other
equity or voting interest in, any Person.

 



 

(b) Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Applicable Laws of the jurisdiction of its
respective organization (to the extent the "good standing" concept is
applicable in the case of any jurisdiction outside the United States). Each of
the Companys Subsidiaries has the requisite corporate or equivalent power and
authority to carry on its respective business as it is presently being
conducted and to own, lease or operate its respective properties and assets.
Each of the Companys Subsidiaries is duly qualified to do business and is in
good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties owned
or leased or the nature of its activities make such qualification necessary
(to the extent the

 



      
 

 



 

"qualification to do business" or "good standing" concept is applicable in the
case of any jurisdiction outside the United States), except where the failure
to be so qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has delivered or made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation, articles of association and bylaws (or equivalent
organizational documents), as amended to date, of the Companys Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity or
voting interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company (i) have been duly
authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and (ii) are
owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company (other than director qualifying
shares), free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and free of
any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote, sell or
otherwise dispose of such capital stock (other than restrictions on transfer
under Applicable Law) or other equity or voting interest) that would prevent
the operation by the Surviving Corporation of such Subsidiarys business as
presently conducted.

 



 

(d) There are no outstanding (i) securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of,
or other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (ii)
options, stock appreciation rights, warrants, restricted stock units, rights
or other commitments or agreements to acquire from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest in, or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable for shares of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interest in, any Subsidiary of the Company, (iii)
obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter into any subscription,
warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security or other similar
agreement or commitment (whether payable in equity, cash or otherwise)
relating to any capital stock of, or other equity or voting interest
(including any voting debt) in, any Subsidiary of the Company (the items in
clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), together with the capital stock of the
Subsidiaries of the Company, being referred to collectively as " _Subsidiary
Securities_ ") or (iv) other obligations by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to make any payments based on the price or value of any
Subsidiary Securities. There are no Contracts of any kind which obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire
any outstanding Subsidiary Securities.

(a) Since the Reference Date, the Company has filed or furnished (as

of this Agreement and until the Effective Time, the Company will file all
forms, reports, schedules, statements and documents with the SEC that are
required to be filed by it under Applicable Law at or prior to the time so

same may have been amended since the date of their filing, the " _SEC Reports_
").

 



 

(b) Except to the extent updated, amended, restated or corrected by a
subsequent

 



       
 

 



 

SEC Report prior to the date hereof, each SEC Report complied, or will comply,
as the case may be, as of its filing date, as to form in all material respects
with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, and with all applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
each as in effect on the date such SEC Report was, or will be, filed.

 



 

(c) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received from the SEC
or any other Governmental Authority any written comments or questions with
respect to any of the SEC Reports (including the financial statements included
therein) or any registration statement filed by any of them with the SEC since
the Reference Date or any notice from the SEC or other Governmental Authority
that such SEC Reports (including the financial statements included therein) or
registration statements are being reviewed or investigated, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there is not, any investigation or review being
conducted by the SEC or any other Governmental Authority of any SEC Reports

certification, such certification was true and accurate and complied with the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Neither the Company nor any of its executive officers has
received written notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or
questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such
certifications.

 



 

3.8 _Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The consolidated financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries
filed in or furnished with the SEC Reports have been or will be, as the case
may be, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied by the Company

the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited interim financial statements,
as may be permitted by the SEC for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q), and fairly
present in all material respects, or will fairly present in all material
respects, as the case may be, the consolidated financial position of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject to
normal year-end adjustments in the case of any unaudited interim financial
statements).

 



 

(b) The Companys system of internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) is sufficient
to provide reasonable assurance (i) that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures are executed in accordance with the
authorization of management, and (iii) that any unauthorized use, acquisition
or disposition of the

 



      
 

 



 

Companys assets that would materially affect the Companys financial
statements would be detected or prevented in a timely manner.

 



 

(c) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that (i) all information (both financial and non-financial) required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported to the
individuals responsible for preparing such reports within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and (ii) all such information is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the
certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial
officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect to such
reports.

 



 

(d) Since the Reference Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has identified or been made aware of (i) any significant deficiency or
material weakness in the system of internal accounting controls utilized by
the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves the Companys management or other employees who have a role in
the preparation of financial statements or the internal accounting controls
utilized by the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iii) any claim or allegation
regarding any of the foregoing.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, partnership agreement or

structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand (such as any arrangement described in Item 303(a)(4) of
Regulation S-K of the SEC)) where the purpose or effect of such arrangement is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving the Company or any
its Subsidiaries in the Companys consolidated financial statements.

 



 

(f) Since the Reference Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee,

substantive complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or
oral, that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices. Since the Reference Date, no current or

or to any current director or executive officer of the Company.

 



 

(g) To the knowledge of the Company, since the Reference Date no employee of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has provided or is providing
information to any law enforcement agency regarding the commission or possible
commission of any crime or the violation or possible violation of any
Applicable Law of the type described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-

 



      
 

 



 

Oxley Act by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Since the Reference Date,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the
Company, any director, officer, employee, contractor, subcontractor or agent
of the Company or any such Subsidiary has discharged, demoted, suspended,

payable to any accountant, outside legal counsel or financial advisor which

hereof, except for actions expressly contemplated by this Agreement, the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries has been conducted, in all
material respects, in the ordinary course consistent with past practice, and
there has not been or occurred or there does not exist, as the case may be,
(a) any Company Material Adverse Effect, or (b) any action that, if taken
after the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent,
would constitute a breach of _Section 5.2_.

 



 

3.11 _Material Contracts_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a complete
and accurate list of all Material Contracts (other than the Material Contracts

10-K) to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as of the
date hereof. The Company has delivered or made available to Parent complete
and correct copies of each such Material Contract.

 



 

(b) Each Material Contract is valid and binding on the Company (and/or each
such Subsidiary of the Company, as the case may be) and is in full force and
effect, and except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, (i) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries party thereto, nor,
to the knowledge of the Company, any other party thereto, is in breach of, or
default under any such Material Contract, and (ii) no event has occurred that
with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute such a breach or default
thereunder by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of
the Company, any other party thereto. Since the Reference Date, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice regarding
any actual or possible material violation or material breach of or material
default under, or intention to cancel or modify, any Material Contract.

terms of all permits, licenses, authorizations, consents, approvals and
franchises from Governmental Authorities required to occupy and operate each
Real Property and to conduct their businesses as currently conducted ("
_Permits_ "), and no suspension or cancellation of any such Permits is pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for such
noncompliance, suspensions or cancellations that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to result in material Liability to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries hold, to the
extent legally required, all Permits that are required for the operation of
the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. Since
the Reference Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any written notice from any Governmental Authority regarding (a) any

this Agreement, against any present or former officer or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries in such individuals capacity as such, or
against any of the respective properties of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, including the Assets and the Real Property, or (to the knowledge
of the Company) against third parties affecting such properties, in each case
that (a) involves an amount in controversy in excess of $500,000, (b) seeks

extensions) all U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. Tax Returns required
to be filed by any of them; and (ii) paid, or have reserved in accordance with
GAAP on the face of the Balance Sheet (as opposed to the notes thereto) for

(c) No audits or other examinations with respect to material amounts of Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are presently in progress or have

a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not file Tax
Returns.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a

liability for the Taxes of any Person other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to Treasury Regulation § 1.1502-6 (or any similar

successor, or otherwise by operation of law.

 



      
 

 



 

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to
include any material item of income in, or exclude any material item of

or any similar United States Governmental Authority relating to any compliance
issues currently pending in respect of any such Employee Plan; (vi) with
respect to each International Employee Plan, to the extent applicable, the

whole.

 



 

(b) Each Employee Plan has been maintained, operated and administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and with all Applicable
Law, including the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code.

 



 

(c) Each Employee Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section 401 of
the Code may rely on a prototype opinion letter or has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS to such effect and to the Companys
knowledge nothing has occurred or exists since the date of such determination
or opinion letter that would reasonably be expected to result in the
revocation

 



      
 

 



 

of the qualified status of any such Employee Plan. To the extent legally
required, each International Employee Plan has been approved by the relevant
taxation and other Governmental Authority.

 



 

(d) To the knowledge of the Company, all contributions, premiums and other
payments required to be made with respect to any Employee Plan have been
timely made, accrued or reserved for. There are no Legal Proceedings pending
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened on behalf of or against any

sponsor, plan administrator or any fiduciary or any Employee Plan with respect
to the administration or operation of such plans, other than routine claims
for benefits that have been or are being handled through an administrative
claims procedure.

 



 

(e) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or, to the knowledge of the
Company, any of their respective directors, officers, employees or agents has,
with respect to any Employee Plan, engaged in or been a party to any non-
exempt "prohibited transaction," as such term is defined in Section 4975 of
the Code or Section 406 of ERISA, which could reasonably be expected to result
in the imposition of a material penalty assessed pursuant to Section 502(i) of
ERISA or a material tax imposed by Section 4975 of the Code.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
ERISA Affiliates has, since September 30, 2010, maintained, participated in or
contributed to (or been obligated to contribute to) (i) an Employee Plan which

"multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) subject to Title

welfare plan" subject to Section 419 of the Code or (v) a voluntary employees
beneficiary association subject to Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. No Employee
Plan provides material welfare benefits that are not fully insured through an
insurance contract. With respect to each Employee Plan as to which Parent or
any of its ERISA Affiliates may incur any Liability under, or which is subject
to, Section 412 of the Code or Title IV of ERISA: (i) no such Employee Plan
has been terminated so as to result or reasonably be likely to result,
directly or indirectly, in any material Liability to Parent or any of its
ERISA Affiliates under Title IV of ERISA; (ii) no complete or partial
withdrawal from such Employee Plan has been made by any of the Company or any
of its ERISA Affiliates or by any other Person, so as to result, or reasonably
be likely to result, in any material Liability to Parent or any of its ERISA
Affiliates; (iii) no proceeding has been initiated by any Person (including
the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the " _PBGC_ ")) to terminate any
such Employee Plan or to appoint a trustee for any such Employee Plan; (iv) no
condition or event currently exists or currently is expected to occur that
could reasonably be expected to result, directly or indirectly, in any
Liability of Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates under Title IV of ERISA,
whether to the PBGC or otherwise, on account of the termination of or
withdrawal from any such Company Employee Plan; (v) if any such Employee Plan
were to be terminated as of the Closing Date or if any Person were to withdraw
from such Employee Plan, none of the Parent or any of its ERISA Affiliates
would incur, directly or indirectly, any material Liability under Title IV of
ERISA; (vi) no "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) for
which notice has not been waived has occurred with respect to any such
Employee Plan within the past 12 months that,

 



      
 

 



 

individually or in the aggregate, would result in a material Liability to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (vii) no such Employee Plan
has incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302
of ERISA and Section 412 of the Code, respectively), whether or not waived,
and none of the Company or any of its ERISA Affiliates has provided, or is
required to provide, security to any Employee Plan pursuant to Section
401(a)(29) of the Code; and (viii) the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not result in any event described in Section 4062(e) of ERISA.

post-termination or retiree life insurance, health or other welfare benefits
to any person, other than pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code or any similar
Applicable Law.

 



 

(h) Each Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations and guidance thereunder (" _Section 409A_") is in material
compliance with the documentary and operational requirements of Section 409A,
and all Company Options that may otherwise be subject to Section 409A have
been granted at a per share exercise price that is at least equal to the fair
market value of a share of the underlying Company Common Stock as of the date
the Company Option was granted, as determined in accordance with applicable
Law, including Section 409A.

 



 

(i) Except as required by the terms of any Employee Plan or Applicable Law,
neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger) will,
either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i) result in any
material payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any director, employee, consultant or independent contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) materially increase the amount or
value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be
provided to any such director, employee, consultant or independent contractor,
(iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of
any such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in the payment of any amount
that would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code. There is
no contract, agreement, plan or arrangement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it is bound to gross up or otherwise
compensate any current or former employee or other disqualified individual for
excise taxes that may be required pursuant to Section 4999 of the Code or any
Taxes required by Section 409A.

 



 

(j) No deduction for federal income tax purposes has been nor is any such
deduction expected by the Company to be disallowed for remuneration paid by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by reason of Section 162(m) or Section
404 of the Code including by reason of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(k) No International Employee Plan has unfunded liabilities that as of the
Effective Time will not be offset by insurance or fully accrued. _Section
3.16(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth, to the extent
applicable, each International Employee Plan that has been approved by the
relevant taxation and other Governmental Authorities so as to enable: (i) the

 



      
 

 



 

Company and the participants and beneficiaries under the relevant
International Employee Plan and (ii) in the case of any International Employee
Plan under which resources are set aside in advance of the benefits being paid
(a "Funded International Employee Plan") the assets held for the purposes of
the Funded International Employee Plans, to enjoy favorable taxation status
under Applicable Laws relating to employee benefit plans. The Company is not
aware of any ground on which any such approval may cease to apply.

 



 

3.17 _Labor Matters_.

 



 

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Contract
or arrangement between or applying to, one or more employees or other service
providers and a union, trade union, works council, group of employees or any
other employee representative body, for collective bargaining or other
negotiating or consultation purposes or reflecting the outcome of such
collective bargaining or negotiation or consultation with respect to their
respective employees with any labor organization, union, group, association,

Affiliates is a party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent under any term or
condition of the Commitment Letter, or otherwise result in any portion of the
Financing contemplated thereby to be unavailable. There are no conditions
precedent related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing, other
than as set forth in the Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to the
Company. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article III_ and the performance by the Company and its Subsidiaries of
the covenants contained in this Agreement, in each case such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.2_ would be satisfied, as of the date
hereof Parent has no reason to believe that any term or condition to the
Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter will not be fully satisfied on a
timely basis or that the Financing will not be available to Parent and Merger
Sub at the Closing, including any reason to believe that any of the

 



      
 

 



 

Financing Sources will not perform their respective funding obligations under
the Commitment Letter in accordance with their respective terms and
conditions.

 



 

4.8 _Acknowledgment by Parent and Merger Sub_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub

discovered by the Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the
other hand, that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement, any Other Required Company Filing or any Other Required
Parent Filing, as the case may be, so that such filing would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the

adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to approve, endorse, adopt or
recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or Acquisition Transaction other than the

Board Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change at any time
prior to obtaining the Requisite Stockholder Approval in the event that:

after the date of this Agreement that was not solicited in violation of
_Section 6.2(b)_;

financial advisor and its outside legal counsel) that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal (which determination and any public
announcement thereof shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change);

Board shall have given Parent at least five (5) Business Days notice of its
intention to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this
_Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ (the " _Notice Period_ ") (which notice shall include
the most current version of the proposed definitive agreement (which shall be
marked to show changes to this Agreement) and, to the extent not included
therein, all material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the
identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal);

 



 

(E) if requested by Parent, during the Notice Period, the Company shall have
met and negotiated in good faith with Parent regarding modifications to the

to be a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(F) prior to the end of the Notice Period, Parent shall not have made a
counter-offer or proposal in writing and in a manner that, if accepted by the
Company, would form a binding contract, that the Company Board determines
(after consultation with its financial advisor and its outside legal counsel)
is at least as favorable to the Company Stockholders as such Superior Proposal
(it being understood that (x) any material revision to the terms of a Superior
Proposal, including, any revision in price, shall require a new notice
pursuant to clause (C) above, (y) the Notice Period shall be extended, if
applicable, to the extent necessary to ensure that at least three (3) Business
Days remain in the Notice Period subsequent to the time the Company notifies
Parent of any such material revision and (z) there may be multiple extensions
of the Notice Period); and

 



 

(G) the Company Board determines (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and after considering any counter-offer or proposal made by Parent
pursuant to clause (E) above), that, in light of such Superior Proposal, the
failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response
to an Intervening Event at any time prior to obtaining the Requisite
Stockholder Approval in the event that the Company Board determines (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change in response to such Intervening Event
would

 



       
 

 



 

reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties;
_provided_ that, prior to effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_, the Company Board shall have given
Parent at least five (5) Business Days notice of its intention to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)(iii)_
(which notice shall include the reason (in reasonable detail) for such Company
Board Recommendation Change) and, if requested by Parent, the Company shall
have met and negotiated in good faith with Parent regarding modifications to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company Board no longer
determines that the failure to make a Company Board Recommendation Change in
response to such Intervening Event would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties.

 



 

(iv) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) under the Exchange Act or complying with the provisions of Rule 14d-9
under the Exchange Act or any other Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that
any statement(s) made by the Company Board pursuant to Rule 14e-2(a) under the
Exchange Act or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act shall be subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement; _provided, further_ , for avoidance of
doubt, that it shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change for
the Company Board to make a "stop, look and listen" communication pursuant to
Rule 14d9-f.

 



 

7.2 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 



 

(a) _Filings and Cooperation_. As soon as reasonably practicable following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, or as mutually agreed by antitrust
counsel of each party, each of Parent and the Company shall file with the FTC
and the Antitrust Division of the DOJ a Notification and Report Form relating
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger) as required or advisable by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-
merger notification filings, forms and submissions that are required under all
other applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of Parent and the Company shall (a)
cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such filings, (b)
supply the other with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate such filings, and (c) supply any additional information that
reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition
or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and that Parent
reasonably deems necessary and/or appropriate. Each party hereto shall
promptly inform the other party or parties hereto, as the case may be, of any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding the Merger or any
other the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If any party hereto or
Affiliate thereof receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or
any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such party shall
use reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, as soon as
reasonably practicable and after consultation with the other party, an
appropriate response in compliance with such request. The parties to this
Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging
such information and providing such assistance as the other party may
reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking early
termination of any applicable waiting periods, including under the HSR Act.
The parties to this Agreement shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications

 



      
 

 



 

between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that materials may be redacted (i) to remove
references concerning the valuation of the Company, (ii) as necessary to
comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality concerns.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 7.2(a)_, Parent shall
have primary responsibility for scheduling and conducting any meeting with any
Governmental Authority, coordinating and making any applications and filings
with, and resolving any investigation or other inquiry of, any agency or other
Governmental Authority, obtaining and maintaining all approvals, consents,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations required to be
obtained from any Governmental Authority that are necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Remedies_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of
_Section 7.2(a)_, if and to the extent necessary to resolve such objections,
if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to
clearance of the Merger pursuant to the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws
applicable to the Merger, each of Parent and Merger Sub (and their respective
Affiliates, if applicable) and the Company and its Subsidiaries will (i)
offer, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order
or otherwise, any restrictions on the activities of Parent and Merger Sub (and
their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand, and the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand; and (ii) contest, defend and appeal
any Legal Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; _provided_ that, neither Parent
nor Merger Sub (nor their respective Affiliates, if applicable) or the Company
and its Subsidiaries shall be required to sell, divest, license or otherwise
dispose of any capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets
(whether tangible or intangible), rights, products or businesses of Parent or
Merger Sub (or their respective Affiliates, if applicable), on the one hand,
and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand (collectively, "
_Remedial Actions_ "); _provided, further,_ that if any Governmental Authority
shall recommend, request or require any Remedial Action, Parent shall control
all aspects of such Remedial Action unless otherwise prohibited by Applicable
Law, including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Remedial Action involves
the capital stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible
or intangible), rights, products or businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as long as any such Remedial Action with respect to the capital
stock or other equity or voting interest, assets (whether tangible or
intangible), rights, products or businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries is only effective upon, and subject to, consummation of the
Merger.

 



 

(c) _Additional Actions_. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier to
occur of the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the
Effective Time, unless the Company otherwise consents, Parent and Merger Sub
will not, and will not permit any of their Affiliates to, acquire or agree to
acquire by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial
portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any business of
any Person or other business organization or division thereof, or otherwise
acquire or agree to acquire any assets if such business competes in any line
of business of the Company or its Subsidiaries and the entering

 



      
 

 



 

into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the consummation of, such
acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be expected to (i)
materially increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorization, consent,
order, declaration or approval of any Governmental Authority necessary to
consummate the Merger or the expiration or termination of any applicable
waiting period, (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Authority entering an order prohibiting the consummation of the Merger, (iii)
materially increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on
appeal or otherwise, or (iv) prevent the consummation of the Merger.

 



 

7.3 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) _No Amendments to Commitment Letter_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, each of Parent and Merger Sub will not permit any amendment
or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy
pursuant to, the Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or waiver
would, or could reasonably be expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing unless Parent or Merger Sub may draw upon an available revolving
credit facility to fund an amount equal to such reduction, (ii) impose new or
additional conditions or other terms (except in connection with any "market
flex" terms contained in the Commitment Letter provided as of the date hereof)
to the Financing, or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the conditions
to the receipt of the Financing, in a manner that would reasonably be expected
to (A) materially delay, prevent or materially impede the consummation of the
Merger, or (B) make the timely funding of the Financing, or the satisfaction
of the conditions to obtaining the Financing, less likely to occur in any
material respect, (iii) materially and adversely impact the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto or (iv)
prevent, impede or materially delay the consummation of the Financing. In
addition to the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall not release or consent
to the termination of the Commitment Letter or of any individual lender under
the Commitment Letter, except for (x) assignments and replacements of an
individual lender under the terms of, and only in connection with, the
syndication of the Financing under the Commitment Letter, or (y) replacements
of the Commitment Letter with alternative financing commitments pursuant to
_Section 7.3(b)_.

 



 

(b) _Financing and Alternate Financing_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
use its reasonable best efforts (taking into account the expected timing of
the Marketing Period) to arrange the Financing and obtain the financing
contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions (including, to the extent
required, the full exercise of any flex provisions) set forth in the
Commitment Letter, including (i) maintaining in full force and effect the
Commitment Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof, (ii) complying with its obligations under the Commitment Letter,
(iii) negotiating, executing and delivering definitive agreements with respect
to the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Commitment
Letter, (iv) satisfying (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, seeking the waiver
of) on a timely basis all conditions and covenants to funding that are
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letter and the
definitive agreements with respect to the Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter that are within

 



      
 

 



 

their control, (v) enforcing its rights under the Commitment Letter and (vi)
consummating the Financing at or prior to the Closing. Parent and Merger Sub
will fully pay, or cause to be fully paid, all commitment or other fees
arising pursuant to the Commitment Letter as and when they become due. In
furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that any
portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including the flex provisions) set forth in the Commitment Letter, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable following
the occurrence of such event, (i) obtain alternative financing from
alternative sources on terms and conditions not materially less favorable in
the aggregate to Parent and Merger Sub than those set forth in the Commitment
Letter (including any "flex" provisions contained in the related fee letter)
and in an amount at least equal to the Financing or such unavailable portion
thereof, as the case may be (the " _Alternate Financing_ "), and (ii) obtain
one or more new financing commitment letters with respect to such Alternate
Financing (the " _New Commitment Letter_ "), which New Commitment Letter will
replace the existing Commitment Letter in whole or in part. Parent shall
promptly provide the Company with a copy of any New Commitment Letter (and any
fee letter in connection therewith (except that the fee amounts, pricing caps
and other economic terms, none of which would adversely affect the amount,
conditionality, availability or termination of the Alternate Financing to be
funded at the Closing, set forth therein may be redacted)). In the event that
any New Commitment Letter is obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement to
the "Commitment Letter" will be deemed to include the Commitment Letter to the
extent not superseded by a New Commitment Letter at the time in question and
any New Commitment Letter to the extent then in effect, and (B) any reference
in this Agreement to the "Financing" means the financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter as modified pursuant to the foregoing subclause (A).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither this _Section 7.3(b)_ nor any other
provision herein shall be construed to require Parent or any of its Affiliates
to commence or prosecute any action, litigation, claims, arbitration or other
proceeding, at law or in equity, against any other parties to the Commitment
Letter in order to consummate the Financing. Parent and Merger Sub will not,
and will not permit any of their Affiliates to, agree to take any action
outside of the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice that
would reasonably be expected to materially interfere with their ability to
obtain the Financing.

 



 

(c) _Information_. Parent shall (i) keep the Company reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing
or any applicable Alternate Financing and (ii) promptly (but in any event
within three (3) Business Days) provide the Company with copies of all
executed amendments, modifications or replacements of the Commitment Letter
(it being understood that any amendments, modifications or replacements shall
only be as permitted herein) or definitive agreements related to the Financing
(except that any fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms, none of
which would adversely affect the amount, conditionality, availability or
termination of the Financing to be funded at the Closing, set forth therein
may be redacted). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall promptly notify the Company (A) of any breach (or threatened
breach) or default (or any event or circumstance that, with notice or lapse of
time or both, could reasonably be expected to give rise to any breach or
default) by any party to the Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Financing that becomes known to Parents chief executive
officer, chief financial officer or

 



      
 

 



 

general counsel, (B) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of any notice or
communication from any Financing Source with respect to any breach, default,
termination or repudiation, or threat thereof, by any party to the Commitment
Letter or any definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions
of the Commitment Letter or such definitive agreements and (C) if for any
reason Parent or Merger Sub at any time believes it will not be able to obtain
all or any material portion of the Financing on substantially the terms, in
substantially the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Commitment
Letter. All non-public or other confidential information provided to the
Company or its Affiliates or any of their respective Representatives pursuant
to this Agreement will be kept confidential to the extent and in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(d) _No Financing Condition_. Parent and Merger Sub each acknowledge and agree
that obtaining the Financing is not a condition to the Closing.

 



 

(e) _Company Support_.

 



 

(i) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents expense, such
cooperation in connection with the Financing as may be reasonably requested by
Parent, including:

 



 

(A) reasonably assisting (and causing senior management and other
Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and

Subsidiaries or their respective securities; and (ii) customary materials for
rating agency presentations;

its Subsidiaries) as Parent, Merger Sub or the Financing Sources shall
reasonably request in order to consummate the Financing and (ii) informing
Parent if the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer or

Subsidiaries) as may be reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise

(I) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (x) permit the Financing

establishing collateral arrangements and (y) establish bank and other accounts

(K) taking all corporate and other actions, subject to the occurrence of the

(M) ensuring that there will not be any competing issues of debt securities or

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the

relating to the Financing will be effective until the Effective Time, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to take any
action pursuant to any certificate, agreement, arrangement, document or
instrument (including being an issuer or other obligor with respect to the
Financing) that is not

 



      
 

 



 

contingent on the occurrence of the Closing or that must be effective prior to
the Effective Time. Nothing in this Agreement will require (A) any officer or
Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to deliver any
certificate or opinion or take any other action pursuant to _Section
7.3(e)(i)_ or any other provision of this Agreement that could reasonably be
expected to result in personal liability to such officer or Representative or

financing or Contracts related thereto prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(f) _Use of Logos_. The Company hereby consents to the use of all logos of the
Company and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing so long as such
logos (i) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii) are
used solely in connection with a description of the Company, its business and
products or the Merger. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that the use
of such logos shall in no way diminish, waive, transfer or relinquish any
rights the Company or its Subsidiaries may have in such logos.

 



 

(g) _Updates to Required Information_. The Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the

Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to periodically update any
Required Information provided to Parent as may be necessary so that such
Required Information is Compliant; _provided_ that the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to update any such information required to be updated
pursuant to clause (iii) of the definition of "Compliant" prior to the time
that the Marketing Period, once commenced, shall be deemed not to have
commenced pursuant to clause (y)(iii) of the last sentence of the definition
thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent may, to most effectively access
the financing markets, require the cooperation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under _Section 7.3(e)_ and this _Section 7.3(g)_ at any time,
and from time to time and on multiple occasions, between the date hereof and
the Closing. The Company agrees to file all reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q
and Form 8-K, including financial information required pursuant to Item 9.01
thereof, in each case, required to be filed by the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act prior to the Closing Date in accordance with the time periods
required by the Exchange Act. In addition, if, in connection with a marketing
effort contemplated by the Commitment Letter, Parent reasonably requests the
Company to file a Current Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act that
contains material non-public information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, which Parent reasonably determines (and Company does not
unreasonably object) to include in a customary offering memorandum for the
Financing, then, upon the Companys review of and reasonable satisfaction with
such filing, the Company shall file such Current Report on Form 8-K.

 



 

(h) _Confidentiality_. All non-public or other confidential information
provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to this
Agreement will be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement, except that, notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement or any other agreement, Parent and Merger Sub
will be permitted to disclose such information to any financing source
(including the Financing Sources)

 



      
 

 



 

and other financial institutions and investors that are or may become parties
to the Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Financing (and in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (i) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto, or (ii) are subject to other
confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to the Company and of
which the Company is a beneficiary. Parent shall be responsible for all
breaches of the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement by any Person
provided non-public or confidential information by Parent or Merger Sub
pursuant to the preceding sentence.

 



 

(i) _Company Reimbursement and Indemnification_.

 



 

(i) Upon request by the Company, Parent shall promptly (and in any event
within thirty (30) calendar days of invoice) reimburse the Company for all
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable out-of-
pocket legal fees and expenses) (other than costs that Company and/or any of
its Subsidiaries incur in the ordinary course of business ( _e.g.,_ reports
required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act)) incurred by
the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation
contemplated by _Section 7.3(e)_ and _Section 7.3(g)_.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and each of their respective Representatives, from and against
any and all losses, damages, claims, interest, costs or expenses (including
reasonable out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses), awards, judgments and
penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection with providing the
support and cooperation contemplated by _Section 7.3(e)_ and _Section
7.3(g)_ and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
information provided by the Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or
their Representatives in all instances specifically for use therein, or to the
extent such losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses result from the bad
faith, gross negligence, willful misconduct, material breach of this
Agreement, fraud or intentional misrepresentation of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives).

 



 

7.4 _Efforts to Close_. In furtherance and not in limitation of the other
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, including _Sections
7.2_ and _7.3_ , each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and to do
(or cause to be done), and to assist and cooperate with the other party or
parties hereto in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Section 2.2_ to be satisfied or fulfilled, (ii) obtain all necessary
consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Authorities,
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR
Act and all other applicable Antitrust Laws, (iii) obtain all other necessary
consents, waivers, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental
Authorities and make all registrations, declarations and filings with
Governmental Authorities, and (iv) obtain all necessary or appropriate
consents, waivers and approvals under any Material Contracts to which the
Company or any of its

 



      
 

 



 

Subsidiaries is a party in connection with this Agreement and the consummation
of the Merger and other transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
maintain and preserve the benefits under such Contracts following the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger).

 



 

7.5 _Access to the Company_. At all times during the period commencing with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier
to occur of the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article
VIII_ and the Effective Time, the Company shall afford Parent and its
Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours and after
reasonable advance notice, to all assets, properties, books and records and
personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may reasonably
request; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company
may restrict or otherwise prohibit access to any documents or information to
the extent that (i) any Applicable Law requires the Company to restrict or
otherwise prohibit access to such documents or information; (ii) access to
such documents would be in violation of the HSR Act, Sherman Act, or any
applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition laws; (iii) counsel to Parent and
the Company mutually and reasonably agree that access to such documents or
information would give rise to a material risk of waiving any attorney-client
privilege, work product doctrine or other privilege applicable to such
documents or information; (iv) access to a Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party or otherwise bound would violate or cause a
default pursuant to, or give a third Person the right to terminate or
accelerate the rights pursuant to, such Contract; provided that the Company
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third
Person to such Contract (or use reasonable best efforts to provide an
alternative means of access to such Contract that would minimize the
likelihood of any such violation, default or termination if requested by
Parent) and shall identify such Contract to Parent and provide to Parent the
text of the provision of such Contract that would trigger such violation,
default, or right of termination or acceleration; or (v) such documents or
information are reasonably pertinent to any adverse Legal Proceeding between
the Company and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent and its
Affiliates, on the other hand. Nothing in this Section 7.5 shall be construed
to require the Company, or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives, to prepare any reports, analyses, appraisals, opinions or
other information that is not prepared in the ordinary course of its business.
Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
_Section 7.5_ will be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or create a risk of damage or destruction to any property or assets of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. Any access to the properties of the Company and
its Subsidiaries will be subject to the Companys reasonable security measures
and insurance requirements and will not include the right to perform invasive
testing. The terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement will apply
to any information obtained by Parent or any of its Representatives in
connection with any investigation conducted pursuant to the access
contemplated by this _Section 7.5_. All requests for access pursuant to this
_Section 7.5_ must be directed to the chief financial officer of the Company,
or another person designated in writing by the Company.

 



       
 

 



 

7.6 _Notice of Breach_.

 



 

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent in the event that any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement has become untrue or inaccurate
in any material respect, or in the event that the Company has failed to comply
with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or obligation to be
complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement.

 



 

(b) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Article VIII_ and the Effective Time, Parent
shall promptly notify the Company in the event that any representation or
warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, or in the event that Parent or Merger Sub
has failed to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant or
obligation to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement.

 



 

7.7 _Confidentiality_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge
that Parent and the Company have previously executed a Confidentiality
Agreement, dated January 22, 2016 (as amended, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), which shall continue in full force and effect in accordance
with its terms.

 



 

7.8 _Public Disclosure_. The initial press release concerning this Agreement
and the Merger will be a joint press release reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent. Thereafter, the Company (unless the Company Board (or a
committee thereof) has made a Company Board Recommendation Change), on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to consult with the other parties to this Agreement
before (a) participating in any media interviews, (b) engaging in any meetings
or calls with analysts, institutional investors or other similar Persons, or
(c) providing any statements that are public or are reasonably likely to
become public, in any such case to the extent relating to the Merger, and
shall not engage in the foregoing without the prior consent of the other party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
that neither Parent nor the Company will be obligated to obtain such consent
with respect to communications that are (i) required by Applicable Law or any
stock exchange rule or listing agreement, (ii) principally directed to
employees, suppliers, customers, partners or vendors and consistent with the
communications plan previously agreed by Parent and the Company or (iii)
related to or in connection with any disputes between the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent, Merger Sub, the Financing Sources, or their respective
Affiliates, on the other hand, relating to this Agreement.

 



 

7.9 _Transaction Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
promptly notify Parent of all Legal Proceedings commenced or threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, in each case in
connection with, arising from or otherwise relating to the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (" _Transaction Litigation_ ")

 



      
 

 



 

(including by providing copies of all pleadings with respect thereto) and
thereafter keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof.
The Company shall (a) give Parent the opportunity to participate in the
defense, settlement or prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; and (b)
consult with Parent with respect to the defense, settlement and prosecution of
any Transaction Litigation. Further, the Company may not compromise, settle or
come to an arrangement regarding, or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding, any Transaction Litigation unless Parent has consented
thereto in writing (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). For purposes of this _Section 7.9_, "participate"
means that Parent will be kept apprised of proposed strategy and other
significant decisions with respect to the Transaction Litigation by the
Company (to the extent that the attorney-client privilege between the Company
and its counsel is not undermined or otherwise affected), and Parent may offer
comments or suggestions with respect to such Transaction Litigation, but will
not be afforded any decision-making power or other authority over such
Transaction Litigation except for the settlement or compromise consent set
forth above. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 7.9_ shall not apply
to any litigation (including Transaction Litigation) between the Company and
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates,
on the other hand.

 



 

7.10 _Section 16(b) Exemption_. The Company shall take all actions reasonably
necessary to cause the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and any other dispositions of equity securities of the Company
(including derivative securities) in connection with the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or executive officer of the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

7.11 _Directors and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) _Existing Agreements and Protections_. The Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to) honor and fulfill in all respects the obligations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries under any and all indemnification agreements
between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any of their respective
current or former directors and officers and any person who becomes a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "). In addition, during the period
commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Effective Time (or with respect to any claim outstanding on the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, until the resolution of such claim), the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall (and Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificates of
incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational documents) of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of expenses that are at
least as favorable as the indemnification, exculpation and advancement of
expenses provisions set forth in the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(or other similar organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the

 



      
 

 



 

date hereof, and during such six-year period such provisions shall not be
repealed, amended or otherwise modified in any manner except as required by
Applicable Law.

 



 

(b) _Indemnification_. Without limiting the generality of the provisions of
_Section 7.11(a)_, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time (or with respect
to any claim outstanding on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, until
the resolution of such claim), the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) indemnify and hold harmless each
Indemnified Person from and against any costs, fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and investigation expenses), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in
connection with any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim,
proceeding, investigation or inquiry arises directly or indirectly out of or
pertains directly or indirectly to (i) any action or omission or alleged
action or omission in such Indemnified Persons capacity as a director,
officer, managing director, employee, representative or agent of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or other Affiliates occurring prior to or at the
Effective Time, or (ii) any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; _provided, however_ , that if, at any time prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Person delivers to Parent a
written notice asserting a claim for indemnification under this _Section
7.11(b)_, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved. In the event of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to control the
defense thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that, by
electing to control the defense thereof, the Surviving Corporation will be
deemed to have waived any right to object to the Indemnified Persons
entitlement to indemnification hereunder with respect thereto), (ii) the
Indemnified Persons, collectively, shall be entitled to retain one counsel,
except that that any Indemnified Person who has an actual conflict of interest
with one or more other Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to retain his or
her own counsel, in each case, whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall
elect to control the defense of any such claim, proceeding, investigation or
inquiry, (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the reasonable fees and
expenses of such counsel retained by the Indemnified Persons pursuant to the
foregoing _clause (ii)_ promptly after statements therefor are received,
whether or not the Surviving Corporation shall elect to control the defense of
any such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry, and (iv) no Indemnified
Person shall be liable for any settlement effected without his or her prior
express written consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this _Section 7.11(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor any of its Affiliates (including Parent) shall settle or
otherwise compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry
for which indemnification may be sought by an Indemnified Person under this
Agreement unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnified Persons from all liability arising
out of such claim, proceeding, investigation or inquiry.

 



 

(c) _Insurance_. During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending
on the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall

 



      
 

 



 

cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain in effect the Companys current
directors and officers liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") in respect
of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, covering
each person covered by the DandO Insurance, on terms with respect to the
coverage and amounts that are equivalent to those of the DandO Insurance;
_provided, however_ , that in satisfying its obligations under this _Section
7.11(c)_, the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual
premiums in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of the amount paid by the
Company for coverage for its last full fiscal year (such three hundred percent
(300%) amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); _provided, further_ , that
that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding the Maximum Annual Premium. Prior
to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on
the DandO Insurance. In the event that the Company elects to purchase such a
"tail" policy prior to the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail"
policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their respective
obligations thereunder in lieu of all other obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (and Parent) under the first sentence of this _Section 7.11(c)_
for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force and
effect.

 



 

(d) _Successors and Assigns_. If the Surviving Corporation (or Parent) or any
of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfer all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the obligations of the Surviving
Corporation (or Parent) set forth in this _Section 7.11_.

 



 

(e) _No Impairment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 7.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Person (or any other person
who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to
in _Section 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and assigns)) without the prior written
consent of such affected Indemnified Person or other person who is a
beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in
_Section 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and assigns). Each of the Indemnified
Persons or other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the
"tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.11(c)_ (and their heirs and assigns)
are intended to be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.11_, with
full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The rights of the
Indemnified Persons (and other persons who are beneficiaries under the DandO
Insurance or the "tail" policy referred to in _Section 7.11(c)_ (and their
heirs and assigns)) under this _Section 7.11_ shall be in addition to, and
not in substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
certificates of incorporation, bylaws or other equivalent organizational
documents, any and all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or applicable law (whether at law or in
equity).

 



 

(f) _Preservation of Other Rights_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to,
shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance

 



      
 

 



 

claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 7.11_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

7.12 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Acknowledgment of Change of Control_. Parent hereby acknowledges that a
"change of control" (or similar phrase) within the meaning of the Employee
Plans, as applicable, will occur as of the Effective Time, as applicable.

 



 

(b) _Existing Agreements_. From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor
all Employee Plans and compensation arrangements in accordance with their
terms as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time and/or the terms of
this Agreement (including _Section 1.4_ with respect to Company Options),
_provided, however,_ that nothing in this sentence shall prohibit the
Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such Employee Plans,
arrangements or agreements in accordance with their terms or if otherwise
required by this Agreement or Applicable Law.

 



 

(c) _Continuation of Company Plans_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall
(and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries) to) employ the employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who are employed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, for a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time (or, if earlier, the date of termination of
employment of the relevant Continuing Employee), Parent shall (and Parent
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) either (i) maintain for the benefit of each
Continuing Employee the Employee Plans (other than equity based benefits) as
of immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (other than equity-based
plans) (together, the " _Company Plans_ ") at benefit levels that are no less
than those in effect at the Company or its Subsidiaries on the date of this
Agreement under such Employee Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and provide compensation and benefits to each Continuing Employee under such
Company Plans, or (ii) provide compensation and employee benefits (other than
equity based benefits) to each Continuing Employee that, taken as a whole, are
no less favorable in the aggregate to such Continuing Employee than the
compensation and employee benefits (other than equity based benefits) provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time ("
_Comparable Plans_ "), or (iii) provide some combination of (i) and (ii) above
such that each Continuing Employee receives compensation and employee benefits
(other than equity based benefits) that, taken as a whole, are no less
favorable in the aggregate to each Continuing Employee than the compensation
and employee benefits (other than equity based benefits) provided to such
Continuing Employee under the Employee Plans immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



 

(d) _Service Credit; Etc_. To the extent that a Company Plan or Comparable
Plan or other employee benefit plan is made available to any Continuing
Employee on or following the Effective Time, Parent shall (and Parent shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation and its Subsidiaries) to) cause to be granted to such Continuing
Employee credit for all service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
their respective predecessors) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length
of service is relevant (including for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance pay entitlement); _provided, however_ , that such service need not
be credited to the extent that it would result in duplication of coverage or
benefits or was not credited for the same purpose with respect to such
Continuing Employee under the analogous Employee Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, (i) each Continuing Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee benefit plans
sponsored by Parent and its Subsidiaries (other than the Company Plans) (such
plans, collectively, the " _New Plans_ ") to the extent coverage under any
such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Plan, Company Plan
or Comparable Plan in which such Continuing Employee participates or
participated immediately before the Effective Time (such plans, collectively,
the " _Old Plans_ "), (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical, vision, death or disability benefits to any Continuing
Employee, Parent shall (and Parent shall cause its Subsidiaries to) cause all
waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions, evidence of insurability
requirements and actively-at-work or similar requirements of such New Plan to
be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents to
the extent satisfied by or waived for such person under an analogous Old Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and Parent shall (and Parent shall
cause its Subsidiaries to) cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such employees participation
in the corresponding New Plan begins to be given full credit under such New
Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-
of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such New Plan, and (iii) credit the accounts of such
Continuing Employees under any New Plan which is a flexible spending plan with
any unused balance in the account of such Continuing Employee under the
applicable Old Plan. Any vacation or paid time off accrued but unused by a
Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
credited to such Continuing Employee following the Effective Time, and shall
not be subject to accrual limits or other forfeiture that were not applicable
as of the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) _401(k) Plan_. Unless Parent provides written notice to the Company at
least 30 days prior to the Closing Date that such 401(k) plan(s) shall not be
terminated, the Company shall terminate any and all 401(k) plans maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries effective as of the day immediately
preceding the date the Company becomes a member of the same Controlled Group
of Corporations (as defined in Section 414(b) of the Code) as Parent (the "
_401(k) Termination Date_"). If such termination is required pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Company shall provide Parent evidence that the 401(k)
plan(s) of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been terminated pursuant to
resolutions of the Company Board. The form and substance of such resolutions
shall be subject to prompt review and approval of Parent (which approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Company shall also
take such other actions in furtherance of terminating any such 401(k) Plans as
Parent may reasonably request, _provided_ that no

 



      
 

 



 

such action shall commit the Company to any position or consequence that is
effective prior to the 401(k) Termination Date. As soon as practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent will (or will cause the Successor Corporation to)
cause the assets of the terminated Company 401(k) Plan(s) to be disbursed in
full satisfaction of the participants account balances thereunder, _provided_
that, as part of the termination and liquidation process, all participants who
are Continuing Employees shall be permitted to transfer (directly or
indirectly) their Company 401(k) Plan account balances (including any
participant loans) to a new or existing 401(k) Plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (either by way of a trustee-to-trustee transfer or a direct or
indirect rollover). Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and the
applicable plan trustee(s) to take such actions as are required or appropriate
in order to complete the plan termination process as expeditiously as
practicable and in order to avoid adverse consequences to any Continuing
Employees.

 



 

(f) _No Third Party Beneficiary Rights_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, this _Section 7.12_ will not be deemed
to (i) guarantee employment for any period of time for, or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to terminate any Continuing Employee for any reason; (ii) subject
to the limitations and requirements specifically set forth in this _Section
7.12_, require Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries to continue any Company Plan or prevent the amendment,
modification or termination thereof after the Effective Time; (iii) create any
third party beneficiary rights in any Person; or (iv) establish, amend or
modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement.

 



 

7.13 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all action necessary to
cause Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation to perform their respective
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger and other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement. Parent and Merger Sub will be jointly
and severally liable for the failure by either of them to perform and
discharge any of their respective covenants, agreements and obligations
pursuant to and in accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

7.14 _Parent Vote_. Immediately following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, will
execute and deliver to Merger Sub and the Company a written consent approving
the Merger in accordance with the DGCL.

 



 

7.15 _Delisting_. Each of the parties agrees to cooperate with each other in
taking, or causing to be taken, all actions necessary to delist the Shares
from Nasdaq and from the FSE and terminate registration under the Exchange
Act, _provided_ that such delisting and termination shall not be effective
until or after the Effective Time.

 



 

7.16 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub and their respective boards of directors
shall promptly grant such approvals and take such lawful actions as are
necessary so that the Merger and/or such other transactions may be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement, and
otherwise take such lawful actions to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute, and any

 



      
 

 



 

regulations promulgated thereunder, on the Merger and such other transactions.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII

(b) by either Parent or the Company if the Effective Time shall not have
occurred on or before March 16, 2017 (the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided,

solely, in the case of _Section 2.2(a)(iii)_ and _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_, to
the extent the matter giving rise to the failure of such condition to be
satisfied is related to Antitrust Laws)) have been satisfied or waived, then,
at the election of either the Company or Parent, the Termination Date shall be
extended for three (3) months, and such later date shall thereafter be deemed
the Termination Date for all purposes under this Agreement; _provided further_
, that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(b)_ shall not be available to any party hereto whose action or failure to
fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has been the principal cause of or
resulted in the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred on or before

in any such jurisdiction, or (ii) issued or granted any Order that has the
effect of making the Merger permanently illegal in any jurisdiction material

the time of such breach or as of the time such representation or warranty
shall have become inaccurate; _provided, however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that such breach by Parent or Merger Sub or such
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub are
curable by Parent or Merger Sub through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts, then the Company shall not be permitted to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ until the earlier to occur of (A)
thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of written notice from the Company to
Parent of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable or (B) Parent or Merger Sub

reasonable efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that
the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.1(e)_ if such breach or inaccuracy by Parent or Merger Sub is cured within
such thirty (30) calendar day period), and _provided, further,_ the Company
may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(e)_ if it is
then in material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant contained
in this Agreement; or

 



 

(f) by the Company in the event that (i) all of the conditions set forth in

Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ until the earlier to occur of (A)
thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of written notice from the Parent to
the Company of such breach or inaccuracy, as applicable or (B) the Company
ceasing to exercise and continuing not to exercise commercially reasonable
efforts to cure such breach or inaccuracy (it being understood that Parent and
Merger Sub may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_
if such breach or inaccuracy by the Company is cured within such thirty (30)
calendar day period); and _provided, further,_ Parent may not terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(h)_ if it is then in material breach
of any representation, warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement; or

 



 

(i) by Parent in the event that a Triggering Event shall have occurred with
respect to the other party hereto, whether promptly after the Triggering Event
giving rise to either partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this _Section 8.1(i)_ or at any time thereafter.

 



 

8.2 _Notice of Termination_. A party terminating this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_ (other than _Section 8.1(a)_) shall deliver a written notice
to the other party setting forth specific basis for such termination and the
specific provision of _Section 8.1_ pursuant to which this Agreement is being
terminated. A valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_
(other than _Section 8.1(a)_) shall be effective upon receipt by the non-
terminating party of the foregoing written notice.

 



 

8.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, this Agreement shall be of no further
force or effect without Liability of any party or parties hereto, as
applicable (or any stockholder, director, manager, officer, employee, agent,
consultant or representative of such party or parties) to the other party or
parties hereto, as applicable, except (a) for the terms of _Section 7.3(h)_,
_Section 7.3(i)_, _Section 7.7_, _Section 7.8_, this _Section 8.3_,

parties hereto, as applicable, from Liability for any fraud committed in

In addition to the foregoing, no termination of this Agreement shall affect
the obligations of the parties hereto set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, which shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance
with their respective terms and remain fully enforceable in accordance with
their respective terms.

 



 

8.4 _Termination Fees_.

 



 

(a) _Company Termination Fees_.

 



 

(i) In the event that (A) this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Sections 8.1(c)_ or _8.1(h)(i)_ , (B) following the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the time at which a vote is taken on the adoption of
this Agreement at the Company Stockholders Meeting (or

 



       
 

 



 

an adjournment or postponement thereof) an offer or proposal for a Competing
Acquisition Transaction that was not publicly announced or known prior to the
execution of this Agreement is publicly announced or shall become publicly
known and not withdrawn, and (C) within nine (9) months following the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Sections 8.1(c)_ or _8.1(h)(i)_ ,
a Competing Acquisition Transaction is consummated or the Company enters into

a Competing Acquisition Transaction is subsequently consummated, then within
one Business Day after consummation of such Competing Acquisition Transaction,
the Company shall pay to Parent (or its designee) a fee equal to $25,500,000
(the " _Company Termination Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by Parent.

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(g)_, then as a condition to such termination of this Agreement,
the Company shall tender to Parent (and pay to Parent if Parent agrees to
accept such payment) the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
Parent.

 



 

(iii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated pursuant to
_Section 8.1(i)_ (or after a Triggering Event occurs and prior to receipt of
the Requisite Stockholder Approval, this Agreement thereby becomes terminable
pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ as a result, Parent terminates this Agreement
for another reason), then within one (1) Business Day after demand by Parent,
the Company shall pay to Parent the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing
by Parent (it being understood and hereby agreed that the failure to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ promptly following a Triggering
Event shall not prejudice or otherwise limit or impair such partys ability to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(i)_ at any subsequent point
in time prior to receipt of the Requisite Stockholder Approval and collect the
fee contemplated by this _Section 8.4(a)(iii)_).

 



 

(iv) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 



 

(b) _Parent Termination Fee_.

 



 

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, then within one (1) Business Day after such termination by the
Company, Parent shall pay to

 



      
 

 



 

the Company a fee equal to $65,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts
designated in writing by the Company.

 



 

(ii) In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section 8.1(d)_, and in each case
upon the date of such termination pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)_ or _Section
8.1(d)_ (A) all conditions set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ and _Section
2.2(b)_ (other than (i) those conditions that by their terms or nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing and (ii) the conditions set forth in _Sections
2.2(a)(ii)_ , _2.2(a)(iii)_ or _2.2(b)(iv)_ (but solely, in the case of
_Sections 2.2(a)(iii)_ and _2.2(b)(iv)_ , to the extent the matter giving
rise to the failure of such condition to be satisfied is related to Antitrust
Laws)) have been satisfied or waived and (B) Parent is not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(h)_ or _Section 8.1(i)_,
then within one (1) Business Day after such termination by the Company or
Parent, Parent shall pay to the Company the Parent Termination Fee by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
in writing by the Company.

 



 

(iii) The parties hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Parent Termination Fee may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and the
occurrence of different events.

 



 

(c) _Recovery_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby acknowledge and
agree that the covenants set forth in this _Section 8.4_ are an integral part
of this Agreement and the Merger, and that, without these agreements, Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company would not have entered into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to
_Section 8.4(a)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay any amounts due pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_ and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent, on the one
hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a Legal Proceeding that
results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth in _Section
8.4(a)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent for the amount set
forth in _Section 8.4(b)_ or any portion thereof, as applicable, the Company
will pay to Parent or Parent will pay to the Company, as the case may be, its
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
costs) in connection with such Legal Proceeding, together with interest on
such amount or portion thereof at the annual rate of five percent (5%) plus
the prime rate as published in _The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date
that such payment or portion thereof was required to be made through the date
that such payment or portion thereof was actually received, or a lesser rate
that is the maximum permitted by Applicable Law.

 



 

(d) _Acknowledgement_. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that (i)
the agreements contained in this _Section 8.4_ are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from
termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination
Fee or a Parent Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and

 



      
 

 



 

incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant
to _Section 8.4(a)_ or _Section 8.4(b)_ are not a penalty but rather
constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Parent or the Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources
expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in
reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.4_, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement.

other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to
herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Voting Agreements,
constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof;

force and effect until the earlier to occur of (a) the Effective Time and (b)

with its terms. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARENT AND MERGER SUB, ON
THE ONE HAND, NOR THE COMPANY, ON THE OTHER HAND, MAKES ANY REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES TO THE OTHER, AND EACH PARTY HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER

NEGOTIATION, EXECUTION OR DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER
OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH
RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING.

 



 

9.9 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a)
as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of _Section
7.11_, (b) from and after the Effective Time, the rights of holders

reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

9.11 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) _Generally_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies

exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(b) _Remedies of Parent and Merger Sub._

 



 

(i) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto hereby agree that irreparable
injury would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or were otherwise
breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be an
adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the termination fees
contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and hereby
agree that, prior to the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.1_, in the event of any breach of threatened breach by the Company
of any of its obligations hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled
to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement by the Company in the courts described in _Section
9.13_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including
the Companys obligation to consummate the Merger. The election to pursue an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief shall not restrict,
impair or otherwise limit Parent from, in the alternative, seeking to
terminate the Agreement and collect the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.4(a)_; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall Parent be (i)
permitted to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief or any other remedies under this Agreement or available at law or
equity following the payment of the Company Termination Fee or (ii) permitted
or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance of the obligation
to close contemplated by this _Section 9.11(b)_ and any money damages
(including all or any portion of the Company Termination Fee).

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) _Termination and Company Termination Fee_. Parent shall, in lieu of
specific performance, be entitled to (A) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ and (B) payment of the Company Termination Fee
if and when payable pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_.

 



 

(iii) _Monetary Damages_. In no event shall (A) Parent, Merger Sub or any of
their respective Affiliates or (B) the former, current and future holders of
any equity, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
attorneys, Affiliates (other than Parent or Merger Sub), members, managers,
general or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of Parent and
Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates (the foregoing in _clauses (A)_
and _(B)_ collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") have the right to
seek or obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from the Company or any Company
Related Party under this Agreement other than the right of Parent and Merger
Sub to payment of the Company Termination Fee as set forth in _Section
8.4(a)_. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated
in accordance with _Section 8.1_, the Company Termination Fee (if payable
pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_) represents the maximum aggregate Liability of
the Company and any other Company Related Party under this Agreement and the
transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby.

 



 

(c) _Remedies of the Company_.

 



 

(i) _Specific Performance (Pre-Closing Covenants)_. The parties hereto hereby
agree that irreparable injury would occur in the event that any provision of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof
or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies
would not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the
termination fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, prior to the valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, in the event of any breach of threatened
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of their respective obligations
hereunder, and other than as it relates to the right to consummate the Merger
(which are governed by the provisions of _Section 9.11(c)(ii)_), the Company
shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub in the
courts described in _Section 9.13_ and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof.

 



 

(ii) _Specific Performance (Closing)_. The parties hereto hereby agree that
irreparable injury would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or
were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such damages (notwithstanding the
termination fees contemplated hereby). Accordingly, the parties hereto
acknowledge and hereby agree that, prior to a valid termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1_, the Company shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable remedy in connection with
enforcing Parents obligation to consummate the Merger only in the event that
each of the following conditions has been satisfied: (A) the conditions set
forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ and _Section 2.2(b)_ have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing,
each

 



      
 

 



 

of which is capable of being satisfied at the Closing) at the time the Closing
would have occurred but for the failure of the Parent to fund the portion of
the aggregate Merger Consideration not contemplated to be funded from the
Financing, (B) the Financing has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or the Financing Sources have confirmed in writing that it will be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing, (C) Parent and
Merger Sub shall have failed to consummate the Merger by the time the Closing
was required by _Section 2.1_ to occur and (D) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed in writing to Parent that if specific performance is granted and the
Financing is funded, then it will take such actions that are required of it by
this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. In no event shall the Company be
entitled to enforce specifically Parents obligation to cause the Merger to be
consummated if the Financing has not been funded (or Parent has confirmed in
writing to the Company that it will not be funded). In no event shall the
Company be entitled to specifically enforce the terms of this Agreement other
than solely under the specific circumstances and as specifically set forth in
_Section 9.11(c)(i) _and this _Section 9.11(c)(ii)_. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to a remedy of specific
performance or other equitable remedies against any Financing Source. The
election to pursue an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief shall not restrict, impair or otherwise limit the Company from, in the
alternative, seeking to terminate the Agreement and collect the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_; _provided_ that in no event
shall the Company be (i) permitted to pursue an injunction, specific
performance or other equitable relief or any other remedy under this Agreement
or available at law or equity following the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee or (ii) permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance of the obligation to close contemplated by this _Section 9.11(c)_
and any money damages (including all or any portion of the Parent Termination
Fee).

 



 

(iii) _Termination and Parent Termination Fee_. The Company shall, in lieu of
specific performance, be entitled to (A) terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _Section 8.1_ and (B) payment of the Parent Termination Fee
if and when payable pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_.

 



 

(iv) _Monetary Damages_ _._ In no event shall (A) the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates or (B) the former,
current and future holders of any equity, controlling persons, directors,
officers, employees, agents, attorneys, Affiliates, members, managers, general
or limited partners, stockholders and assignees of each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective Affiliates (foregoing in clauses (A)
and (B) collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") have the right to
seek or obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) from Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Parent Related Party other than the right of the Company to payment of
the Parent Termination Fee as set forth in _Section 8.4(b)_. For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with _Section 8.1_, the Parent Termination Fee (if payable pursuant to
_Section 8.4(b)_) represents the maximum aggregate Liability of Parent,
Merger Sub, and any other Parent Related Party under this Agreement and the
transactions and other agreements contemplated hereby. In addition, and
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company hereby
(A) agrees that no Company Related Party shall have the right to seek or
obtain money damages or expense reimbursement (whether at law or in equity, in
contract, in tort or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise) from any Financing Source and (B) waives any and all claims against
the Financing Sources (and agrees not to bring any claim or cause of action)
and hereby agrees that in no event shall the Financing Sources have any
liability or obligation to the Company or any Company Related Party relating
to or arising out of this Agreement, the Financing, the Commitment Letter or
the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this _Section 9.11(c)(iv)_ shall in any way limit or
modify the rights and obligations of Parent, Merger Sub or the Financing
Sources set forth under the Commitment Letter. In addition to the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled, at
Parent and Merger Subs sole election, to settle any claims arising from or
relating to this Agreement by agreeing to consummate the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly available under the terms of
this _Section 9.11_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for
which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy
would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform their
obligations under the provisions of this Agreement in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Solely to the extent that
the right of specific performance is explicitly available under the terms of
this _Section 9.11_, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the courts
described in _Section 9.13_ without proof of damages or otherwise, and that
such explicit rights of specific enforcement are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such rights, none of
the Company, Parent or Merger Sub would have entered into this Agreement. Each
party agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief expressly applicable under this
_Section 9.11_ on the basis that (i) it has an adequate remedy at law or (ii)
an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement will not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with such injunction or enforcement, and each party
irrevocably waives any right that it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or other security.

 



 

(e) _Sole Remedy_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that, except as
otherwise provided in clause (b) of the first sentence of _Section 8.3_, the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.11_ shall be the parties sole and
exclusive remedies for any breaches of this Agreement or any claims relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereto hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law,
any and all other rights, claims and causes of action, known or unknown,
foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that such
party may have against the other party, the Parent Related Parties or the
Company Related Parties, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any
Applicable Law (including any securities law, common law or otherwise) for any
breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(f) _Extension of Termination Date_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, if prior to the Termination Date any party initiates a
Legal Proceeding to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, then
the Termination Date will be automatically extended by (A) the amount of time
during which such Legal Proceeding is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days,
or (B) such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Legal Proceeding.

 



 

9.12 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable conflicts of law principles.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, claims and actions
that are based upon, arise out of, or relate to the Financing or involve the
Financing Sources (each of which is hereby intended to be an express third
party beneficiary of this _Section 9.12_) shall be governed by, and construed
and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, without
giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of laws rules or provisions
(whether of the State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New
York.

 



 

9.13 _Consent to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto (a) irrevocably
consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other process in
any action or proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, for and on behalf of itself or any of its properties or assets, in
such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, and nothing in this
_Section 9.13_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Applicable Law; (b) irrevocably and
unconditionally consents and submits itself and its properties and assets in
any action or proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept or does not have jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any other state or federal court within the State of
Delaware) in the event any dispute or controversy arises out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger), or for
recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof; (c) agrees
that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court; (d) agrees that any
actions or proceedings arising in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger) shall be brought,
tried and determined only in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware
(or, only if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept
or does not have jurisdiction over a particular matter, any other state or
federal court within the State of Delaware); (e) waives any objection that it
may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or proceeding in any
such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient
court and agrees not to plead or claim the same; and (f) agrees that it will
not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger) in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding in such courts as provided above
shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Applicable Law. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of the parties hereto, any of their respective Affiliates,
any Company Related Party or any Parent Related Party will bring, or support,
any action,

 



      
 

 



 

cause of action, claim, cross-claim, counterclaim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether at law or in equity, whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby,
anywhere other than in (i) any New York State court sitting in the Borough of
Manhattan or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York.

 



 

9.14 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF PARENT, COMPANY AND MERGER SUB HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR
COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, COMPANY OR MERGER SUB IN
THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF (INCLUDING
WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FINANCING AND COMMITMENT LETTER).

 



 

9.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic signature), all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the
same counterpart.

of Stockholders family or (B) by surrendering Shares issuable upon exercise

Company Option or to satisfy the Stockholders tax withholding obligation upon
the exercise of such Company Option, in each case as permitted by any Company
Equity Incentive Plan and (ii) if Stockholder is a corporation, then
Stockholder may Transfer the Covered Shares to Stockholders Affiliates
provided that, as a condition to such transfer, the transferee of such shares
agrees in writing to be bound by the terms hereof.

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Voting Rights_. Prior to the Expiration Date, each
Stockholder shall not deposit, or permit the deposit of, any of such
Stockholders Covered Shares in a voting trust, grant, or permit the granting

Covered Shares, or enter into any voting or similar Contract the terms and
conditions of which are inconsistent with the obligations of such Stockholder
under this Agreement with respect to any of such Stockholders Covered Shares.

 



 

3. _Agreement to Vote Covered Shares_.

 



 

(a) At every meeting of the stockholders of the Company (including the Company
Stockholders Meeting) called, and at every adjournment or postponement
thereof, and on every action or approval by written consent of the
stockholders of the Company, in each case prior to the Expiration Date, each
Stockholder shall, or shall cause the holder of record on any applicable
record

 



      
 

 



 

date to, vote or provide a consent with respect to, all of such Stockholders
Covered Shares that are outstanding and entitled to vote:

 



 

(i) in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement, each of the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and each other action the
taking of which would reasonably be expected to facilitate the consummation of
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;

 



 

(ii) against approval of any proposal made in opposition to, or in competition
with, consummation of the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) against any of the following actions (other than those actions that
relate to the Merger and any other transactions contemplated by the Merger

assets, or reorganization of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (B) any

or any of its Subsidiaries, (C) any reorganization, recapitalization,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its

any of its Subsidiaries, or the corporate structure of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (E) any other action that is intended, or would
reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage
or adversely affect the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the
Merger Agreement.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this _Section 3(a)_ shall
not require any Stockholder to be present (in person or by proxy) or vote (or
cause to be voted) any of its Owned Shares to amend the Merger Agreement or
take any action that could result in the amendment or modification, or a
waiver of a provision therein, in any such case, in a manner that (x)
decreases the amount or changes the form of the consideration or imposes any
restrictions or additional conditions on the receipt of the consideration to
the stockholders of the Company or (y) is otherwise materially adverse to the
Stockholder.

 



 

(b) In the event that a meeting of the stockholders of the Company (including
the Company Stockholders Meeting) is held, each Stockholder shall, or shall
cause the holder of record on any applicable record date to, appear at such
meeting or otherwise cause such Stockholders Covered Shares to be counted as
present thereat for purposes of establishing a quorum.

 



 

(c) The Stockholder shall retain at all times the right to vote its Shares in
its sole discretion and without any other limitation on those matters other
than those set forth in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above that are at any time
or from time to time presented for consideration to the Companys stockholders
generally. For the avoidance of doubt, clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall not
apply to votes, if any, solely on the election or removal of directors as
recommended by the Companys Board of Directors (provided such recommendation
is not in violation of the terms of the Merger Agreement).

 



 

4. _No Solicitation_. Each Stockholder shall, and shall cause any of its Representatives to, comply with _Sections 6.1_ and _6.2_ of the Merger Agreement as if each Stockholder were the 

 



      
 

 



 

Company and a party thereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent, Merger Sub and each Stockholder acknowledges and hereby agrees that
any violation of the restrictions set forth in this _Section 4_ by any
Representative of such Stockholder shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 4_ by such Stockholder.

 



 

5. _Agreement Not to Exercise Appraisal Rights_. Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any appraisal rights or dissenters rights relating to the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement that such Stockholder may have with respect to such Stockholders Covered Shares pursuant to Applicable Law.

 



 

6. _Directors and Officers_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall (or require any Stockholder to attempt to) limit or restrict any Stockholder (or any designee of any Stockholder) who is a director or officer of the Company from acting in such capacity on any matter (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to each Stockholder solely in such Stockholders capacity as a holder of Shares and/or holder of options to purchase Shares); _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section 6_ is intended to modify or otherwise obviate any of the rights or obligations under the Merger Agreement. In this regard, the Stockholder shall not be deemed to make any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in Stockholders capacity as a director or officer of the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall limit in any way the Company or its officers or directors from taking actions permitted or required by the Merger Agreement and Parent shall not assert any claim that any action taken by any Stockholder in his or her capacity as a director or officer of the Company violates any provision of this Agreement.

 



 

7. _Irrevocable Proxy_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each Stockholder shall deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a proxy in the form attached hereto as _Annex A_ (the " _Proxy_ "), which shall be irrevocable to the fullest extent permissible by Applicable Law, with respect to all of such Stockholders Covered Shares.

 



 

8. _No Ownership Interest_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent and/or Merger Sub any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Stockholders Covered Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to each Stockholders Covered Shares shall remain vested in and belong to each Stockholder, and Parent and Merger Sub shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern, or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct such Stockholder in the voting of any of such Stockholders Covered Shares, except as otherwise provided herein. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing herein shall require such Stockholder to exercise any option and/or other rights to purchase Shares (including Company Options).

 



 

9. _Representations and Warranties of Stockholders_. Each Stockholder hereby represents and warrants to Parent, severally and not jointly, and solely as to itself and its Covered Shares, as of the date hereof that:

 



 

(a) _Power; Binding Agreement_. Such Stockholder has the legal capacity to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the Proxy, to perform such
Stockholders obligations

 



      
 

 



 

hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement and the Proxy have been duly executed and delivered by such
Stockholder, and, assuming this Agreement constitutes a legal valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, constitute a valid and binding
obligation of such Stockholder, enforceable against such Stockholder in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability (i) may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other
similar Applicable Laws affecting or relating to creditors rights generally
and (ii) is subject to general principles of equity.

 



 

(b) _No Conflicts_. Except for filings that may be required under the Exchange
Act and the HSR Act, and any applicable foreign antitrust, competition or
merger control Applicable Laws, no Consent of any Governmental Authority is
required on the part of such Stockholder in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by such Stockholder of this Agreement and the Proxy
and the consummation by such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. None of the execution, delivery or performance by such
Stockholder of this Agreement or the Proxy, the performance by such
Stockholder of its obligations hereunder or thereunder or the consummation by
such Stockholder of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby will (i)
violate, conflict or result in the breach of, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or result in the termination of, or accelerate the performance required
by, or result in a right of termination or acceleration under, any Contract to
which such Stockholder is a party or by which such Stockholders properties or
assets may be bound, except for any violation, conflict, breach, default,
termination or acceleration that would not reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay or otherwise impair the ability of the Stockholder to
perform its obligations hereunder or to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. or (ii) violate or conflict with any Applicable Law or
Order applicable to such Stockholder or by which any of such Stockholders
properties or assets are bound, or (iii) result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the Covered Shares.

 



 

(c) _Ownership of Shares_. Such Stockholder (i) is the Beneficial Owner of the
Company Securities as indicated forth on the signature page to this Agreement,
all of which are free and clear of any Liens, (except any Liens arising under
Applicable Laws or arising hereunder), and (ii) does not own, beneficially or
otherwise, any Company Securities other than the Company Securities indicated
on the signature page to this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Voting Power_. Such Stockholder has or will have sole voting power, sole
power of disposition, sole power to issue instructions with respect to the
matters set forth herein, and sole power to agree to all of the matters set
forth in this Agreement, in each case with respect to all of such
Stockholders Covered Shares, with no limitations, qualifications or
restrictions on such rights, subject to applicable federal securities laws and
the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(e) _No Finder s Fees_. Except for Greenhill and Co., LLC, there is no
investment banker, broker, finder, agent or other Person that has been
retained by or is authorized to act on behalf of the Stockholder who is
entitled to any financial advisors, brokerage, finders or other fee or
commission in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement (including the Merger) or this Agreement based upon arrangements
made by or on behalf of such Stockholder.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) _Reliance by Parent_. Such Stockholder understands and acknowledges that
Parent is entering into the Merger Agreement in reliance upon such
Stockholders execution and delivery of this Agreement.

 



 

10. _Certain Restrictions_. Each Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action that would make any representation or warranty of such Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect in any material respect or enter into any Contract with any Person in any manner inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement or the Proxy.

 



 

11. _Disclosure_. Subject to reasonable prior notice and approval (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), each Stockholder shall permit and hereby authorizes Parent and Merger Sub to publish and disclose in all documents and schedules filed with the SEC, and any press release or other disclosure document that Parent and/or Merger Sub determines to be necessary or desirable in connection with the Merger and any transactions related to thereto, such Stockholders identity and ownership of Covered Shares and the nature of such Stockholders commitments, arrangements and understandings under this Agreement.

 



 

12. _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Stockholder, in such Stockholders capacity as a Stockholder, shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to fulfill such Stockholders obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

13. _Merger Agreement_. Each Stockholder hereby acknowledges receipt of, and has had an opportunity to read and understand and consult with independent counsel concerning, the Merger Agreement (including exhibits and schedules thereto).

 



 

14. _Termination_. This Agreement and the Proxy, and all rights and obligations of the parties hereunder and thereunder, shall terminate and shall have no further force or effect as of the Expiration Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing set forth in this _Section 14_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall relieve either party hereto from any liability, or otherwise limit the liability of either party hereto, for any intentional breach of this Agreement prior to termination.

 



 

15. _Miscellaneous_.

 



 

(a) _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

(b) _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) without the prior written approval of the other parties. Subject to
the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be

 



      
 

 



 

binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(c) _Amendments; Waiver_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto,
and the terms and conditions hereof may be waived, only by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto, or, in the case of a
waiver, by an instrument signed on behalf of the party waiving compliance with
any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by the Stockholder in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that Parent and/or Merger Sub
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

(e) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not
preclude the exercise of any other remedy.

 



 

(f) _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally or by commercial
delivery service, or sent via telecopy (receipt confirmed) to the parties at
the following addresses or telecopy numbers (or at such other address or

that it may now or hereafter have to the venue of any such action or
proceeding in any such court or that such action or proceeding was brought in

stock of the Company that now are or hereafter may be beneficially owned by

until the Expiration Date (as defined below). Upon Stockholders execution of
this Irrevocable Proxy, any and all prior proxies given by Stockholder with
respect to any Proxy Shares are hereby revoked and Stockholder agrees not to

Expiration Date.

 



 

This Irrevocable Proxy is irrevocable to the fullest extent permitted by law,
is coupled with an interest and is granted pursuant to that certain Voting
Agreement of even date herewith by and among Parent and Stockholder and the
other stockholders of the Company named therein (the " _Voting Agreement_ "),
and is granted in consideration of Parent entering into that certain Agreement

or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), among
Parent, [*], a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), and the Company. The Merger Agreement provides for, among
other things, the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the "

As used herein, the term " _Expiration Date_ " shall mean the earliest to

terminated pursuant to the terms thereof or (ii) such date and time as the
Merger shall become effective in accordance with the terms and provisions of
the Merger Agreement.

reasonably be expected to, impede, interfere with, delay, postpone, discourage
or adversely affect the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by the
Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, attorneys and proxies named
above are expressly prohibited from acting as the undersigneds attorney and
proxy to vote the Proxy Shares, or exercising any voting, consent or similar
rights of the undersigned with respect to the Proxy Shares (including, without
limitation, the power to execute and deliver written consents), to amend the
Merger Agreement or take any action that could result in the amendment or
modification, or a waiver of a provision therein, in any such case, in a
manner that (x) decreases the amount or changes the form of the consideration
or imposes any restrictions or additional conditions on the receipt of the
consideration to the stockholders of the Company or (y) is otherwise
materially adverse to the Stockholder

 



 

The attorneys and proxies named above may not exercise this Irrevocable Proxy
on any other matter except as provided herein. Stockholder may vote the Proxy
Shares on all other matters.

 



 

Any obligation of Stockholder hereunder shall be binding upon the successors
and assigns of Stockholder.

 



 

This Irrevocable Proxy shall terminate, and be of no further force and effect,
automatically upon the Expiration Date.
