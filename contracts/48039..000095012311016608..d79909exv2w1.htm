RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Holly, Merger Sub and Frontier determined that it is in the best interests of their respective corporations and stockholders that Holly and Frontier engage in a "merger of equals" business combination in order to advance the long-term strategic business interests of Holly and Frontier; 

  

 WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of each of Holly and Frontier have determined that such "merger of equals" business combination shall be effected pursuant to the terms of this Agreement through the Merger (as defined below);

 WHEREAS, upon consummation of the Merger, Frontier will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holly; 

  

 WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "); 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Holly has approved this Agreement and determined that the terms of this Agreement are fair to and in the best interests of Holly and its stockholders and resolved to recommend to the stockholders of Holly the approval of the issuance of shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Holly (" _Holly Common Stock_ ") constituting the Merger Consideration; and

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Merger Sub has adopted this Agreement and has determined that the Merger is in the best interests of Holly, as its sole shareholder. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE 1 
 THE MERGER 

   

 Section 1.1 THE MERGER. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, in accordance with the Wyoming Business Corporation Act (the " _WBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into Frontier, with Frontier continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger (" _Surviving Corporation_ ") and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the WBCA. As a result of the Merger, Frontier will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Holly. 

  

 Section 1.2 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. 

  

 (a) The Closing. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (i) at the offices of Vinson and Elkins L.L.P., 2001 Ross Avenue, Suite 3700, Dallas, Texas 75201-2975, at 4:00 p.m., local time, on the business day immediately following the day on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be fulfilled or waived in accordance herewith or (ii) at such other time, date or place as Frontier and Holly may agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

 (b) Effective Time of the Merger. As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, Frontier shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Wyoming (the " _Wyoming Secretary_ ") articles of merger with respect to the Merger (such articles of merger, the " _Articles of Merger_ "), which Articles of Merger shall be in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the WBCA. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as Frontier and Holly shall mutually agree and shall be specified in the Articles of Merger; provided that (i) such date and time shall be after the time of filing of the Articles of Merger and (ii) the Merger shall become effective at the same date and time. As used in this Agreement, the term " _Effective Time_ " shall mean the date and time when the Merger becomes effective. 

  

 Section 1.3 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of Frontier shall be amended and restated to read in the form of Exhibit A and, as so amended and restated, such articles of incorporation shall be the articles of incorporation of Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. 

  

 Section 1.4 BYLAWS. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of Frontier shall be amended and restated to be the same as the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law. 

  

       |   | Section 1.5 DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 (a) The directors and executive officers of Holly at the Effective Time shall be as provided in Section 5.15. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of Surviving Corporation, in each case, until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified. 

  

 Section 1.6 ACTIONS OF HOLLY. Holly, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, by its execution and delivery hereof, consents to such corporations entering into and performing this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Holly shall take all actions necessary to cause Merger Sub to take any actions necessary in order to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 1.7 ALTERNATIVE STRUCTURES. The parties agree to reasonably cooperate in the consideration and implementation of alternative structures to effect the business combination contemplated by this Agreement, including without limitation, by merging Frontier with and into Merger Sub, or by merging Frontier into Holly, as long as such alternative structure does not (i) impose any material delay on, or condition to, the consummation of the Merger, (ii) cause any closing condition set forth in Article 6 not to be capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived by the party entitled to the benefits thereof) or (iii) adversely affect any of the parties hereto or either Hollys or Frontiers stockholders; provided, however, that the fact that a direct merger of Frontier into Holly would require the approval of a majority of the holders of outstanding shares of Holly Common Stock shall not be deemed to have the effect of (i), (ii) or (iii) above. 

  

ARTICLE 2 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES 

   

 Section 2.1 EFFECT ON CAPITAL STOCK OF FRONTIER AND MERGER SUB. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Frontier, Holly, Merger Sub or any holder of any shares of Frontier Common Stock: 

  

 (a) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) Each share of Frontier Common Stock that is held by Frontier as treasury stock or that is owned by Frontier, Holly, Merger Sub, any direct or indirect wholly owned Frontier Subsidiary or any direct or indirect wholly owned Holly Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) Except as provided in Section 2.1(b) and Section 2.7, each share of Frontier Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 0.4811 (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Holly Common Stock. 

  

 (d) The consideration provided for in Section 2.1(c), together with the consideration provided for in Section 2.7, is referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_." At the Effective Time, each certificate, whether represented in certificated or non-certificated book-entry form (a 

   ##### 

  

 

" _Frontier Certificate_ "), formerly representing any shares of Frontier
Common Stock, shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and the right to receive any distribution or dividends pursuant
to Section 2.5. 

   

 (e) All of such shares of Holly Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall be duly authorized and validly issued and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof. All shares of Frontier Common Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Frontier Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any shares of Frontier Common Stock shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Frontier Common Stock, except as provided in Section 2.6 the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be issued in consideration therefor, including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of applicable Holly Common Stock with respect thereto to be issued in consideration therefor, and any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Frontier Common Stock become entitled, all in accordance with this Article 2 upon the surrender of such Frontier Certificate. 

  

 (f) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, there is declared or effected a reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up, stock dividend or stock distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Holly Common Stock or Frontier Common Stock), combination or exchange of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of, Holly Common Stock or Frontier Common Stock, the Merger Consideration shall be adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Frontier Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. 

  

 Section 2.2 SURRENDER OF SHARES. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Holly shall designate a bank or trust company to act as agent for the holders of shares of Frontier Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to receive the Merger Consideration to which holders of such shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 2.1. Prior to, or substantially simultaneously with, the Effective Time, Holly will deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Frontier Certificates, for exchange in accordance with this Article 2 through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the shares of Holly Common Stock to be delivered as the Merger Consideration (such certificates, whether represented in certificated or non-certificated book-entry form, to the extent applicable, the " _Holly Common Certificates_ "). In addition, Holly shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.7 and to pay any dividends or other distributions which holders of Frontier Certificates have the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.5. All such Holly Common Certificates and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section 2.2(a) is hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." 

  

 (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than three business days following the Closing Date, Holly shall cause to be mailed to each record holder, at the Effective Time, of an outstanding Frontier Certificate, a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Frontier Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Frontier Certificate to the Exchange Agent) and instructions for 

   ##### 

  

 

use in effecting the surrender of the Frontier Certificate for payment of the
Merger Consideration therefor. Within three business days after surrender to
the Exchange Agent of a Frontier Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions, the holder of such Frontier Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share
formerly represented by such Frontier Certificate and such Frontier
Certificate shall then be canceled. No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of Frontier Certificates on the Merger Consideration
payable upon the surrender of Frontier Certificates (including, without
limitation, any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.5 or Section 2.7). If
payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the
person in whose name the surrendered Frontier Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of payment that the Frontier Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of the Frontier
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction of
Frontier Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is not
applicable.

 (a) Each option to purchase shares of Frontier Common Stock (a " _Frontier Stock Option_ ") granted under the Frontier Stock Plan, whether or not exercisable or vested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to acquire shares of Frontier Common Stock and shall be converted, at the Effective Time, into a fully vested and immediately exercisable option to purchase shares of Holly Common Stock (a " _Holly Stock Option_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such Frontier Stock Option (but taking into account any changes thereto, including the acceleration thereof, provided for in the Frontier Stock Plan, in any award agreement or in such Frontier Stock Option by reason of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby), except that (i) the number of shares of Holly Common Stock which shall be subject to each such Holly Stock Option shall be the number of shares of Frontier Common Stock subject to each such Frontier Stock Option multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down to the nearest whole share of Holly Common Stock, and (ii) such Holly Stock Option shall have an exercise price per share of Holly Common Stock equal to the exercise price per share of Frontier Common Stock for such Frontier Stock Option divided by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, up to the nearest whole cent; provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in all cases such conversion shall be effected in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder (as modified by Section 409A of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to Frontier Stock Options that are not intended to qualify as "incentive stock options" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code).

   ##### 

  

 

2.3(b) of the Frontier Disclosure Letter, as applicable (such Stock

that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
with respect to which the applicable performance period has not ended prior
to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without any required action on
the part of any holder thereof, be cancelled in full as of such date and such
Frontier Stock Units will be converted into (A) a number of shares of fully
vested Holly Common Stock equal to 125% of the number of shares of Frontier
Common Stock subject to such Frontier Stock Units that are then credited to
the holder, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded, if necessary, down to
the nearest whole share of Holly Common Stock, and (B) an amount of cash

that would have been credited to the holder under the Frontier Stock Plan if
the Frontier Stock Units instead had been issued as shares of Frontier
Restricted Stock; (ii) with respect to each award of Frontier Restricted
Stock that is issued and outstanding (or earned but not yet granted to
the holder after the end of an applicable performance period) immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that is subject to restrictions or other
conditions which have not lapsed immediately prior to the Effective Time, (A)
such Frontier Restricted Stock shall automatically become 100% vested at the
Effective Time and shall be treated at the Effective Time as, and shall be

Section 2.1(c), and (B) the holder of such Frontier Restricted Stock shall be
paid an amount of cash equal to the amount of cash and stock dividends and
dividend equivalents then credited to the holder with respect thereto; and
(iii) with respect to each Frontier Restricted Stock Unit (" _Frontier RSU_

Section 2.3(b) shall be paid or delivered, less all applicable deductions and
withholdings required by applicable law to be withheld in respect of
such amounts, within five business days after the Closing Date, unless
otherwise specified herein. As used in this Agreement, " _Frontier Stock
Unit_ " shall mean "Stock Unit" as such term is defined in the Frontier Stock
Plan, and " _Frontier Restricted Stock_ " shall mean "Restricted Stock" as
such term is defined in the Frontier Stock Plan.

Restricted Stock_ "), on the same terms and conditions as were applicable
under such Frontier Restricted Stock (but taking into account any
changes thereto set forth in the Frontier Retention Agreements), (ii) the
holder thereof shall be paid at the Effective Time an amount of cash equal to
the amount of cash, dividends and dividend equivalents then credited to the
holder with respect thereto and (iii) each share of Frontier Restricted Stock

to the nearest whole share of Holly Restricted Stock and (B) each Frontier
Stock Unit that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and with respect to which the applicable performance period has not
ended prior to the Effective Time shall, automatically and without

Stock, and (y) an amount of cash equal to the amount of cash and stock

 Section 2.4 EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Promptly after the Effective Time but in no event later than three business days following the Closing Date, Holly shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of a Frontier Certificate the documentation specified in Section 2.2(b) hereof. Any uncertificated shares of Frontier Common Stock in book-entry form shall be deemed surrendered to the Exchange Agent at the Effective Time, and each holder thereof shall be entitled to receive (A) Holly Common Certificates representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Holly Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.1 (after taking into account all shares of Holly Common Stock then held by such holder) and (B) a check in the amount equal to the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Holly Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.7 and dividends or other distributions that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.5. The Frontier Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until such time as a Holly Common Certificate is issued to or at the direction of the holder of a surrendered Frontier Certificate, such Holly Common Stock represented thereby shall be deemed not outstanding and shall not be entitled to vote on any matter. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Frontier Common Stock that occurred prior to the Effective Time, but is not registered in the transfer records of Frontier, one or more Holly Common Certificates evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of Holly Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive in lieu of any fractional shares of Holly Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.7 and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.5, may be issued with respect to such Frontier Common Stock to such a transferee if the Frontier Certificate is presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid. If any Holly Common Certificate is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Frontier Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of such exchange that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of Holly Common Certificates in a name other than that of the registered holder of the Frontier Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Holly or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. 

  

 Section 2.5 DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Frontier Certificate with respect to the shares of Holly Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon surrender of such Frontier Certificate, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Holly Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.7 until such holder shall surrender such Frontier Certificate in accordance with Section 2.7. Subject to the effect of applicable law, following 

   ##### 

  

 

surrender of any such Frontier Certificate, there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of
Holly Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.7
and the amount of any dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares
of Holly Common Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
any dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with respect
to such shares of Holly Common Stock. 

   

 Section 2.6 NO FURTHER OWNERSHIP RIGHTS IN FRONTIER COMMON STOCK. All shares of Holly Common Stock issued and cash paid upon exchange of shares of Frontier Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article 2 (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 2.5 or Section 2.7) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Frontier Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.7 NO FRACTIONAL SHARES OF HOLLY COMMON STOCK. No certificates or scrip or shares of Holly Common Stock representing fractional shares of Holly Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Frontier Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of a stockholder of Holly or a holder of shares of Holly Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 2.7, all fractional shares to which a single record holder would be entitled shall be aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Frontier Certificates who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Holly Common Stock (determined after taking into account all Frontier Certificates delivered by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fractional part of a share of Holly Common Stock multiplied by (b) the closing price for a share of Holly Common Stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange (" _NYSE_ ") on the first trading day following the date on which the Effective Time occurs. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash to be paid to such former holders of Frontier Common Stock in lieu of any fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall notify Holly, and Holly shall ensure that there is deposited with the Exchange Agent, and shall cause the Exchange Agent to make available in accordance with this Agreement, such amounts to such former holders of Frontier Common Stock. 

  

 Section 2.8 TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUND. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Frontier Certificates six months after the Effective Time shall, at Hollys request, be delivered to Holly or otherwise on the instruction of Holly, and any holders of Frontier Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article 2 shall after such delivery look only to Holly for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Frontier Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.1, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holly Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 and any dividends or distributions with respect to shares of Holly Common Stock to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5. Any such portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Frontier Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental entity shall, to the extent permitted by law, 

   ##### 

  

 

become the property of Holly free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 Section 2.10 INVESTMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Holly, on a daily basis, provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to Frontier shareholders pursuant to this Article 2\. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to Holly. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by Holly, provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $500 million. 

  

 Section 2.11 LOST CERTIFICATES. If any Frontier Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Frontier Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Holly, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Holly may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Frontier Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Frontier Certificate, the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Frontier Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holly Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Holly Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 Section 2.12 WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Holly shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with the relevant governmental entity by Holly, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Holly. 

  

 Section 2.13 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and directors of Holly or Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Surviving Corporation, Frontier or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of Surviving Corporation, Frontier or Merger Sub, any other actions and things necessary to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in Holly or Surviving Corporation, any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be

in connection with, the Merger. 

   

 Section 2.14 STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. The stock transfer books of Frontier shall be closed immediately upon the Effective Time, and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of Frontier Common Stock thereafter on the records of Frontier. At or after the Effective Time, any Frontier Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent, Holly or Surviving Corporation for any reason shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, with respect to the shares of Frontier Common Stock formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Holly Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.7 and any dividends or other distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5). From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Frontier Certificates evidencing ownership of shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law.

Frontier is duly qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing under the laws of each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it therein or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Frontier Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.9).

All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other ownership interests in, each of Frontiers Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, and is owned, directly or indirectly, by Frontier free and clear of all Liens.

letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement or arrangement (oral or
written) regarding, or that is intended to result in, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Holly Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) will 

    ##### 

  

     

immediately, upon becoming aware of any such discussions, inquiries or
negotiations, cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions,
inquiries or negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect
to any Holly Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that may
reasonably be expected to lead to a Holly Acquisition Proposal, request the
prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished with respect thereto and immediately terminate all physical and
electronic data room access previously granted to any such Person or its
Representatives; provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement
shall prevent Holly or the Holly Board from (1) complying with Rule 14e-2 or
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to a Holly Acquisition
Proposal, (2) making any disclosure to the holders of shares of Holly Common
Stock that the Holly Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
required to make under applicable law or the rules of the NYSE, provided that
in any event the Holly Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change
except in accordance with Section 5.4(b), or (3) at any time prior to
obtaining the Holly Stockholder Approval, providing information (pursuant to
a confidentiality agreement containing terms that are determined in
good faith by Holly to be substantially similar to, and not more favorable to
such Person in the aggregate than, those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any
related agreements will not include any provision calling for any exclusive
right to negotiate with such Person or have the effect of prohibiting Holly
from complying with its obligations under this Agreement)) to, or engaging in
any negotiations or discussions with, any Person or group who has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Holly Acquisition Proposal that did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2 if, with respect to the
actions set forth in this clause (3), (x) in the good faith judgment of the
Holly Board, after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, and after taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory and
other aspects of the Holly Acquisition Proposal, the likelihood of
consummation (including, without limitation, legal and regulatory
considerations and any conditions to, and expected timing risks of,
completion) and any changes to the terms of the Merger proposed by Frontier
in response to such proposal, such Holly Acquisition Proposal is reasonably
likely to result in a transaction more favorable to the holders of the shares
of Holly Common Stock from a financial point of view than the Merger (a "
_Holly Superior Proposal_ ") and (y) the Holly Board, after consultation with
its outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary obligations of the Holly Board under
applicable law. Whenever the term " _group_ " is used in this Agreement, it
is used as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act. 

   

 (b) Holly agrees that it will notify Frontier promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) if any proposal or offer relating to or constituting a Holly Acquisition Proposal is received by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, Holly or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives. Such notice to Frontier shall be made orally and in writing and shall (i) indicate the identity of the Person or group making such request or inquiry or engaging in such negotiations or discussions and (ii) include a copy of the written Holly Acquisition Proposal or, if not in writing, a written summary in reasonable detail of the material terms and conditions of the Holly Acquisition Proposal or the request or inquiry. Thereafter, Holly shall keep Frontier fully informed on a prompt basis (and in any event within 24 hours) of any material changes, additions or adjustments to the terms or conditions of any such proposal or offer. Not less than forty-eight (48) hours prior to taking any action referred to in clause (3) of the proviso of Section 

   ##### 

  

  

5.2(a)(ii), if Holly intends to participate in any such discussions or
negotiations or provide any such information to any such third party, Holly
shall give notice to Frontier including the identity of the relevant person
or group and provide to Frontier all of the information required by this
Section 5.2. Holly will not enter into any agreement on or after the date of
this Agreement that would prevent Holly from providing any information, and
in the manner and within the time, required by this Section 5.2(b) to
Frontier. 

   

 (c) Except in compliance with Section 5.4, nothing in this Section 5.2 shall permit Holly to enter into any agreement with respect to a Holly Acquisition Proposal during the term of this Agreement, it being agreed that, during the term of this Agreement, Holly shall not enter into any agreement with any Person that provides for, or in any way facilitates, a Holly Acquisition Proposal, other than (i) a confidentiality agreement containing terms that are determined in good faith by Holly to be substantially similar to and not more favorable to such Person in the aggregate than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement and any related agreements will not include any provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such Person or having the effect of prohibiting Holly from complying with its obligations under this Section 5.2) and/or (ii) a standstill agreement that is in reasonably customary form and that does not contain terms that have the effect of prohibiting Holly from complying with its obligations under this Section 5.2.

fair market value of all of the assets of Frontier and its Subsidiaries,

Persons (other than Holly and its Affiliates) or the stockholders of such
third Person(s), beneficially owns or would beneficially own 10% or more of
the outstanding shares of Frontier Common Stock or the outstanding voting
power of Frontier or its Subsidiaries or, if applicable, the parent entity

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holly Board or Frontier Board, as applicable (the " _Withdrawing Party_ ," the other party being the " _Non-Withdrawing Party_ "), may at any time prior to obtaining the Holly Requisite Vote or Frontier Requisite Vote, as applicable, (i) other than in connection with any Holly Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Holly) or Frontier Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Frontier) (which must be made pursuant to clause (ii) below), make an Adverse Recommendation Change if the Holly Board or the Frontier Board, as the case may be, determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under applicable law (such action, an " _Other Fiduciary Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with any Holly Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Holly) or Frontier Acquisition Proposal (in the case of Frontier), if the Holly Board or the Frontier Board, as the case may be, determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that (A) an unsolicited bona fide written Holly Acquisition 

   ##### 

  

  

Proposal (in the case of Holly) or Frontier Acquisition Proposal (in the case
of Frontier) made after the date of this Agreement and not the result of a
breach of Section 5.2 or Section 5.3, as the case may be, constitutes a Holly
Superior Proposal (in the case of Holly) or a Frontier Superior Proposal (in
the case of Frontier) and (B) the failure to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with their fiduciary duties under
applicable law (such action, a " _Superior Proposal Adverse Recommendation
Change_ "); provided, however, that the Withdrawing Party may only take the
foregoing actions if (1) the Withdrawing Party has provided written notice to
the Non-Withdrawing Party (a " _Withdrawal Notice_ ") advising the Non-
Withdrawing Party that the Board of Directors of the Withdrawing Party
intends to take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the
reasons for such action), (2) if any Holly Superior Proposal or
Frontier Superior Proposal, as applicable, is the basis for such action, the
Withdrawal Notice specifies the material terms and conditions of the Holly
Superior Proposal or Frontier Superior Proposal, as applicable, and
identifies the Person or group making such Holly Superior Proposal or
Frontier Superior Proposal (and including a copy of the most current version
of the agreement or proposal relating to such Holly Superior Proposal or
Frontier Superior Proposal, as applicable (or, if no such written proposal
exists, a written summary of the material terms and conditions of such
Holly Superior Proposal or Frontier Superior Proposal, as applicable)), (3)
at least five business days have elapsed following the Non-Withdrawing
Partys receipt of such Withdrawal Notice (it being understood that any
amendment or modification to any Acquisition Proposal that is the basis
for such proposed action shall require a new Withdrawal Notice and a new five
business day period) and (4) if requested by the Non-Withdrawing Party, the
Withdrawing Party has negotiated in good faith with the Non-Withdrawing Party
during such five business day period (as extended pursuant to clause (3)
above) with respect to any changes to this Agreement proposed by the Non-
Withdrawing Party during such period. In determining whether to give a
Withdrawal Notice or take the actions specified in the prior sentence, the
Holly Board or Frontier Board, as applicable, shall in good faith take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by the Non-
Withdrawing Party, and the Withdrawing Party shall not terminate this
Agreement in accordance with Section 7.3(c) or Section 7.4(c), as applicable,
with respect to a Holly Superior Proposal or a Frontier Superior Proposal, as
applicable, unless, prior to the effectiveness of such termination, the
board of directors of the Withdrawing Party shall have determined in good
faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that,
notwithstanding any such changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
the Non-Withdrawing Party, the failure to make a Superior Proposal
Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with their fiduciary
duties under applicable law. Holly and Frontier shall each be required to
comply with its obligations under Section 5.4(a) whether or not its Board of
Directors withdraws, modifies, withholds or changes its recommendation with
respect to the matters described in Section 5.4(a) to be submitted to their
respective stockholders or declares the advisability of any other offer or
proposal. Any disclosure by Holly or Frontier relating to a Holly Acquisition
Proposal (in the case of Holly) or a Frontier Acquisition Proposal (in the
case of Frontier) shall be deemed to be an action specified in this Section
5.4(b) by Holly or Frontier, as applicable, unless the Holly Board or Frontier
Board, as applicable, reaffirms in such disclosure its recommendation with
respect to the matters described in Section 5.4(a) to be submitted to their
respective stockholders. It is understood that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4(b) by any director, officer,
employee, agent or representative (including financial or legal advisor or
other 

    ##### 

  

     

retained representative) of either party or any of its Subsidiaries will be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.4(b) by such party. 

   

 (c) The Holly Board has approved and declared advisable an amendment to Hollys certificate of incorporation in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _Amendment_ ") to, among other things, increase the number of authorized shares under its certificate of incorporation and to change its corporate name at the Effective Time in accordance with Section 5.15(f), and resolved to recommend the approval and adoption of the Amendment to the holders of Holly Common Stock. In addition, the Holly Board will approve and declare advisable an amendment to the Holly Corporation Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan to increase the number of authorized shares of Holly Common Stock available for issuance under the Holly Corporation Long-Term Incentive Compensation Plan to a reasonable number of shares taking into account the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to the consummation of the Merger, and will resolve to recommend the approval and adoption of such amendment to the holders of Holly Common Stock. Holly shall use its reasonable best efforts to take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law and its certificate of incorporation and bylaws to obtain such approvals at the Holly stockholders meeting referred to in Section 5.4(a); provided, however, that in no event shall obtaining approval of such proposals be a condition precedent to the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) Promptly following the execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of the parties hereto, Holly, as the sole shareholder of Merger Sub, will approve this Agreement. 

  

 Section 5.5 FILINGS; REASONABLE BEST EFFORTS.

 (ii) each use its reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible. 

  

 (c) Neither Frontier nor Holly shall, without the other partys prior written consent, commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters, including covenants affecting business operating practices (or allow its Subsidiaries to commit to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters) in connection with the transactions contemplated under this Agreement, but the parties shall commit or consent to, and shall use reasonable efforts to effect (and shall cause their Subsidiaries to commit or consent to and use reasonable efforts to effect), any such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters as any governmental entity shall request if such divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters are required by any such governmental entity as a condition to resolving such governmental entitys objections to the Merger or obtaining its approval of the Merger and are contingent upon consummation of the Merger; provided that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5(c) or the remainder of this Agreement, neither Frontier, Holly nor any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to agree (with respect to (x) Frontier or its Subsidiaries or (y) Holly or its Subsidiaries) to any divestitures, licenses, hold separate arrangements or similar matters, including covenants 

   ##### 

  

  

affecting business operating practices, if such divestitures, licenses,
arrangements or similar matters, individually or in the aggregate, would
materially impair the business operations of Holly, Frontier and their
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as combined in the manner currently intended
by the parties. 

   

 Section 5.6 INSPECTION. From the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Holly and Frontier shall allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants and other representatives of the other party reasonable access at all reasonable times upon reasonable notice to the records and files, correspondence, audits and properties, as well as to all information relating to commitments, contracts, titles and financial position, or otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs of Holly and its Subsidiaries or Frontier and its Subsidiaries, including inspection of such properties; provided that no investigation pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall affect any representation or warranty given by any party hereunder, and provided further that notwithstanding the provision of information or investigation by any party, no party shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party shall be required to provide any information which it reasonably believes it may not provide to any other party by reason of applicable law, rules or regulations, which that party reasonably believes constitutes information protected by attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep confidential by reason of contract or agreement with third parties. The parties hereto will make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Holly and Frontier agree that they will not, and will cause their representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.6 for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. All nonpublic information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall be governed by the Mutual Confidentiality Agreement dated January 17, 2011 between Frontier and Holly (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 Section 5.7 PUBLICITY. Holly and Frontier will consult with each other and will mutually agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press releases or making any such public announcements.

As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, Frontier and Holly shall cooperate in preparing and each shall cause to be filed with the SEC mutually acceptable joint proxy materials (the " _Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") and Frontier and Holly shall prepare, and Holly shall file with the SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 under the Securities Act (the " _Registration Statement_ "). The Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be included as a prospectus in and will constitute a part of the Registration Statement as Hollys prospectus. Each of Frontier and Holly shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement/Prospectus cleared by the SEC and the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated 

   ##### 

  

  

hereby. Each of Frontier and Holly shall, as promptly as practicable after
receipt thereof, provide the other parties with copies of any written

Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement received from the SEC.
Frontier and Holly shall cooperate and provide the other parties with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Registration Statement prior to
filing such with the SEC, and each will provide each other party with a copy
of all such filings made with the SEC. Notwithstanding any other
provision herein to the contrary, no amendment or supplement (including by
incorporation by reference) to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the
Registration Statement shall be made without the approval of both Frontier
and Holly, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
provided that, with respect to documents filed by a party hereto that are
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement or Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, this right of approval shall apply only with respect to
information relating to the other party or its business, financial condition
or results of operations; and provided, further, that Frontier, in connection
with a change in the recommendation of the Frontier Board as to the Merger,
and Holly, in connection with a change in the recommendation of the Holly
Board as to the Merger, may amend or supplement the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Registration Statement (including by
incorporation by reference) to effect such a change, and in such event, this
right of approval shall apply only with respect to information relating to
the other party or its business, financial condition or results
of operations, and shall be subject to the right of each party to have its
Board of Directors deliberations and conclusions accurately described.
Frontier will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/
Prospectus to be mailed to Frontier shareholders, and Holly will
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be
mailed to Holly stockholders, in each case, as promptly as practicable after
the Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.
Each of Frontier and Holly shall advise the other parties, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has
become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of the Holly Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC
for amendment of the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Registration Statement.
If, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information relating to
Frontier or Holly, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or
directors, is discovered by Frontier or Holly and such information should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration
Statement or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party hereto
discovering such information shall promptly notify the other parties and, to
the extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and disseminated to the stockholders of Frontier and Holly.

 Section 5.11 INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE. 

  

 (a) From and after the Effective Time, Holly shall as provided in this Section 5.11 cause Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law each person who is immediately prior to the Effective Time, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Frontier or Holly (or any Subsidiary or division thereof), and each person who immediately prior to the Effective Time is serving or prior to the Effective Time has served at the request of Frontier or Holly as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, an " _Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs or expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, by them in their capacities as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent such indemnification by Surviving Corporation is permitted under applicable law. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (an " _Action_ "), (i) Holly shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Holly, in advance of the final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and, if required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law, and (ii) Holly will, and will cause Surviving Corporation to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, neither Holly nor Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further that neither Holly nor Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section 5.11(a) to pay the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel, except for one local counsel, for all Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interest between two or more of such Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group. With respect to any determination of whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification by Surviving Corporation under this Section 5.11, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, as contemplated by the WBCA, to require that such determination be made by special legal counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and approved by Surviving Corporation (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Frontier, Holly or the Indemnified Party within the last three (3) years. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) The rights to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action or suit, in the certificate of incorporation or articles of incorporation, bylaws and any indemnification agreement of Frontier, Holly and their respective Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. 

  

 (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Holly shall, or shall cause Surviving Corporation to, maintain officers and directors liability insurance covering each person who is immediately prior to the Effective Time, or has been at any time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of Frontier (or any Subsidiary or division thereof), and each person who immediately prior to the Effective Time is serving or prior to the Effective Time has served at the request of Frontier, as a director, officer, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise (individually, a " _Frontier Indemnified Party_ " and, collectively, the " _Frontier Indemnified Parties_ ") who are or at any time prior to the Effective Time were covered by their respective officers and directors liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") policies on terms substantially no less advantageous to the Frontier Indemnified Parties than such existing insurance with respect to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or omissions, prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or other proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the Effective Time); provided that, after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay annual premiums in excess of 250% of the annual premium amount payable by Frontier for the policy year including the date of this Agreement (the amount of which premium is set forth in Schedule 5.11(c) of the Frontier Disclosure Letter), but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably practicable for such amount. Holly shall have the right to cause coverage to be extended under the DandO Insurance of Frontier by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions substantially no less advantageous than Frontiers existing DandO Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this Section 5.11(c). 

  

 (d) The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation or bylaws of Frontier or Holly, as applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, under the DGCL or WBCA, or otherwise. The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the consummation of the Merger, are expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Parties, and may not be amended or terminated after the Effective Time in a manner contrary to the interest of an Indemnified Party without the consent of such Indemnified Party. 

  

 (e) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Frontier, Holly and Surviving Corporation contained in this Section 5.11 shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of Holly and Surviving Corporation. In the event Holly or Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Holly or Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 5.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS. 

  

 (a) After the Effective Time, Holly shall honor, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to honor, all employee benefit plans, contracts, agreements and commitments of Frontier or any of its Subsidiaries maintained or entered into by Frontier or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the date of this Agreement that apply to any current or former employee or current or former director of Frontier or any of its Subsidiaries, as applicable; provided, however, that, except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.12, Holly reserves the right to modify, and to cause any of its Subsidiaries to modify, any such plan, contract, agreement or commitment in accordance with its terms. 

  

 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.12(a): 

   

 (i) Except as provided in Section 2.3 and Section 5.1 (pertaining to the Frontier Stock Plan), Frontier and Holly agree that for the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending December 31, 2011 (or such later date as may be determined by Holly), Surviving Corporation shall assume and maintain all Frontier Plans as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend any such plan to reduce any benefit provided under any such plan. With respect to any Frontier Plan that is a qualified defined contribution plan providing for discretionary employer contributions, such contributions for 2011 shall be made at approximately the same percentage of compensation (or employee or salary deferral contribution in the case of a discretionary matching contribution) of eligible participants as was made to such plan for 2010. Notwithstanding the foregoing, contributions may be adjusted to the extent necessary to comply with applicable law and regulations. 

   

 (ii) Each employee of Frontier or any of its Subsidiaries who becomes an employee of Holly, Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time without any gap in employment shall be credited with service with Frontier, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their predecessors, for purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit determination under any employee benefit plan or policy of Holly or Surviving Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section 5.12(b)(ii) shall not apply to the determination of accrual service under any defined benefit pension plan as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA (regardless whether such plan is qualified under Code Section 401(a)) that did not cover the employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not apply to the determination of the right to receive, or the amount of, any retiree or other post-retirement medical service (except for COBRA medical continuation coverage as described in Section 4980B of the Code or any arrangement covering the employee prior to the Effective Time). 

   

 (iii) Subject to compliance with applicable local law, nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall be construed to restrict the ability of any entity to modify or terminate any plan (at or after the Effective Time) with respect to persons employed at operations outside the United States. 

   

 (iv) Nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall be construed as a contract of employment, and this Section 5.12(b) shall not give any employee the right to be retained 

   ##### 

  

  

in the employ of any entity. Nothing in this Section 5.12(b) shall be
construed to require the provision of coverage or benefits to an employee
following termination of employment except to the extent such coverage or
benefits is otherwise required pursuant to the terms of the applicable plan
or arrangement or by applicable law. 

   

 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the parties shall cause the Holly Board, or a duly authorized committee of "non-employee" directors thereof, to authorize the conversion of Frontier Stock Options into Holly Stock Options (and the acquisition of shares of Holly Common Stock thereunder), the conversion of Frontier Stock Units into Holly Stock Units, and the conversion of Frontier Restricted Stock into Holly Restricted Stock, in each case in accordance with Section 2.3 at the Effective Time, and to take such other actions as may be necessary to authorize the events contemplated in Section 2.3. Such resolution shall set forth the name of the applicable "insiders" for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act, the number of securities to be acquired by each such individual, and that the approval is being granted to exempt the transaction under Rule 16b-3 of the Exchange Act. Holly shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Holly Common Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Holly Common Stock that will be subject to Holly Stock Options and Holly Stock Units and each award of Holly Restricted Stock as a result of the actions contemplated by Section 2.3. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Holly shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available, other appropriate forms) with respect to the shares of Holly Common Stock subject to such Holly Stock Options, Holly Stock Units and Holly Restricted Stock and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Holly Stock Options, Holly Stock Units and Holly Restricted Stock remain outstanding. 

  

 (d) Any other provisions hereof to the contrary notwithstanding, the provisions of this Section 5.12 do not cover, and shall not be deemed for the benefit of, any Frontier Represented Employees. 

  

 (e) Prior to or simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement and effective at the Effective Time, (i) Frontier, Holly and each of the Name Executives shall enter into a written retention agreement as to certain matters related to the Merger (the " _Frontier Retention Agreements_ ") and (ii) Holly and each of Matthew P. Clifton, Bruce R. Shaw and David L. Lamp shall enter into a waiver agreement as to certain matters related to the Merger (the " _Holly Waiver Agreements_ "), which Frontier Retention Agreements and Holly Waiver Agreements shall not be amended or modified without the prior written consent of the other party. 

  

 Section 5.13 TAX QUALIFICATION. 

  

 (a) Holly shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in Section 6.2(b), including the execution of the officers certificates referred to therein and in Section 6.3(b). Holly shall use its reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action (including any action otherwise permitted by Section 5.1(a)) that 

   ##### 

  

  

would prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

   

 (b) Frontier shall use its reasonable best efforts to, and to cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) cause the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) obtain the opinion of counsel referred to in Section 6.3(b), including the execution of the officers certificates referred to therein and in Section 6.2(b). Frontier shall use its reasonable best efforts not to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts not to permit any of its Subsidiaries to, take any action (including any action otherwise permitted by Section 5.1(b)) that would prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

 Section 5.14 DIVIDENDS.

 (i) by Holly or Frontier pursuant to either Section 7.2(a) (only to the extent that the Holly stockholders meeting described in Section 5.4(a) has not been held) or Section 7.2(b) and, in either case, if (A) prior to the time of the Holly Requisite Vote not being obtained at a duly held meeting of the Holly stockholders called for that purpose (including adjournments and postponements) or prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Holly Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known or an intention to make a Holly Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or has otherwise become publicly known and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination Holly enters into a definitive agreement to consummate a Holly Acquisition Proposal or a Holly Acquisition Proposal is consummated; provided, however, that for the purpose of this Section 7.5(a)(i), all references in the definition of Holly Acquisition Proposal to "10%" shall instead be deemed to refer to "40%"; 

   

 (ii) by Frontier pursuant to Section 7.4(b); 

   

 (iii) by Holly pursuant to Section 7.3(c); 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iv) by Frontier pursuant to Section 7.4(a) as a result of Hollys material breach of its obligations under Section 5.2; or 

   

 (v) by Frontier pursuant to Section 7.2(e) as a result of Hollys material breach of its obligations under Section 5.18; 

  

then Holly shall pay Frontier the Holly Termination Amount (as defined below)
and, in addition, reimburse Frontier for all expenses incurred by Frontier in
connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount (as
defined below). All payments under this Section 7.5(a) shall be made in cash
by wire transfer to an account designated by Frontier (x) in the case of
clause (ii), (iv) or (v) above, on the business day immediately following
such termination, (y) in the case of clause (iii) above, prior to such
termination, and (z) in the case of clause (i) above, on the date of the

Frontier for all expenses incurred by Frontier in connection with this
Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount if this Agreement has been
terminated pursuant to Section 7.2(b) even if Frontier is not entitled to any
Holly Termination Amount under this Section 7.5(a). Holly acknowledges that
the agreements contained in this Section 7.5(a) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Frontier would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Holly fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.5(a),
and, in order to obtain such payment, Frontier commences a suit which results
in a judgment against Holly for the payment set forth in this Section 7.5(a),
Holly shall pay to Frontier its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Holly
Termination Amount and other amounts to be reimbursed to Frontier under this
Section 7.5(a) from the date payment was required to be made until the date

such payment was required to be made plus one percent (1%). If this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to a provision that calls for a payment to be made
under this Section 7.5(a), it shall not be a defense to Hollys obligation to
pay hereunder that this Agreement could have been terminated under a
different provision or could have been terminated at an earlier or later
time. 

   

 (b) If this Agreement is terminated 

   

 (i) by Holly or Frontier pursuant to either Section 7.2(a) (only to the extent that the Frontier shareholders meeting described in Section 5.4(a) has not been held) or Section 7.2(c) and, in either case, if (A) prior to the time of the Frontier Requisite Vote not being obtained at a duly held meeting of the Frontier shareholders called for that purpose (including adjournments and postponements) or prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Frontier Acquisition Proposal shall have become publicly known or an intention to make a Frontier Acquisition Proposal has been publicly announced or has otherwise become publicly known and (B) within twelve (12) months after such termination Frontier enters into a definitive agreement to consummate a Frontier Acquisition Proposal or a Frontier Acquisition Proposal is consummated; provided, however, that for the purpose of this Section 7.5(b)(i), all references in the definition of Frontier Acquisition Proposal to "10%" shall instead be deemed to refer to "40%"; 

   ##### 

  

   

 (ii) by Holly pursuant to Section 7.3(b); 

   

 (iii) by Frontier pursuant to Section 7.4(c); 

   

 (iv) by Holly pursuant to Section 7.3(a) as a result of Frontiers material breach of its obligations under Section 5.3; or 

   

 (v) by Holly pursuant to Section 7.2(e) as a result of Frontiers material breach of its obligations under Section 5.18; 

  

then Frontier shall pay Holly the Frontier Termination Amount (as defined
below) and, in addition, reimburse Holly for all expenses incurred by Holly
in connection with this Agreement up to the Reimbursement Maximum Amount. All
payments under this Section 7.5(b) shall be made in cash by wire transfer to
an account designated by Holly (x) in the case of clause (ii), (iv) or (v)
above, on the first business day immediately following such termination, (y)
in the case of clause (iii) above, prior to such termination, and (z) in the
case of clause (i) above, on the date of the first to occur of the events
referred to in clause (i)(B) above. The term " _Frontier Termination Amount_
" shall mean $80,000,000. In addition, Frontier shall reimburse Holly for all
expenses incurred by Holly in connection with this Agreement up to the
Reimbursement Maximum Amount if this Agreement has been terminated pursuant
to Section 7.2(c) even if Holly is not entitled to any Frontier Termination
Amount under this Section 7.5(b). Frontier acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.5(b) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these
agreements, Holly would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if
Frontier fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.5(b),
and, in order to obtain such payment, Holly commences a suit which results in
a judgment against Frontier for the payment set forth in this Section 7.5(b),
Frontier shall pay to Holly its costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the Frontier
Termination Amount and other amounts to be reimbursed to Holly under this
Section 7.5(b) from the date payment was required to be made until the date
of such payment at the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A. in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made plus one percent (1%). If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to a provision that calls for a payment
to be made under this Section 7.5(b), it shall not be a defense to Frontiers
obligation to pay hereunder that this Agreement could have been terminated
under a different provision or could have been terminated at an earlier or
later time. 

   

 Section 7.6 EFFECT OF VOTE. Any right to terminate this Agreement provided under Section 7.1, Section 7.2(a), Section 7.2(d), Section 7.3(a) or Section 7.4(a) hereunder shall be effective notwithstanding whether the Holly Requisite Vote or the Frontier Requisite Vote has been obtained.

delivered by the parties in connection herewith constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings among the parties with
respect thereto. No addition to or modification of any provision of
this Agreement shall be binding upon any party hereto unless made in writing
and signed by all parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement and for the avoidance of doubt, the parties acknowledge that
(i) nothing in this Agreement is binding on MLP or its Subsidiaries (the "
_MLP Entities_ "), which entities are not parties to this Agreement, and that
there shall be no recourse against any MLP Entity or any director, officer,
general partner, partner, member, managing member, shareholder or person in
similar capacity of any MLP Entity for any breach of any provision of this
Agreement that applies to the activities of any MLP Entity, and (ii)
Holly and Merger Sub shall be responsible for any breach of this Agreement
based on any actions taken or not taken by any MLP Entity. 

   

 (b) This Agreement (which constitutes a "Definitive Transaction Agreement" as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), the Confidentiality Agreement (other than Sections 3 and 9 thereof, which are hereby suspended and shall be of no further force or effect during the term of this Agreement and after the Effective Time, but shall come back into effect if this Agreement is terminated without the consummation of the Merger), the exhibits and schedules to this Agreement, the Holly Disclosure Letter, the Frontier Disclosure Letter and any documents delivered by the parties in connection herewith are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies other than (i) as specifically provided in Section 5.11, (ii) the right of Frontier, on behalf of its shareholders, to pursue damages and other relief, including equitable relief, in the event of Hollys or Merger Subs willful and material breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or willful and material breach of any of its covenants and agreements in this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Holly and Merger Sub and (iii) the right of Holly, on behalf of its stockholders, to pursue damages and other relief, including equitable relief, in the event of Frontiers willful and material breach of any of its representations and warranties in this Agreement or willful and material breach of any of its covenants and agreements in this Agreement, which right is hereby acknowledged and agreed by Frontier; provided, however, that the rights granted pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) shall be enforceable on behalf of holders of Frontier Common Stock only by Frontier in its sole and absolute discretion or on behalf of holders of Holly Common Stock only by Holly in its sole and absolute discretion, it being understood and agreed that any and all interests in such claims shall attach to such shares of Frontier Common Stock or Holly Common Stock, as applicable, and subsequently trade and transfer therewith and, consequently, any damages, settlements or other amounts recovered or received by Frontier or Holly, as applicable, with respect to such claims (net of expenses incurred by Frontier or Holly, as applicable, in connection therewith) may, in Frontiers or Hollys, as applicable, sole and absolute discretion, be (x) as applicable, distributed, in whole or in part, by Frontier to the holders of shares of Frontier Common Stock of record as of any date determined by Frontier or by Holly to the holders of shares of Holly Common Stock of record as of any date determined by Holly or (y) as applicable, retained by Frontier for the use and benefit of Frontier on behalf of its shareholders in 

   ##### 

  

  

any manner Frontier deems fit or retained by Holly for the use and benefit of
Holly on behalf of its stockholders in any manner Holly deems fit. 

   

 (c) EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER FRONTIER NOR HOLLY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, NOTWITHSTANDING THE DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO ANY OTHER PARTY OR ANY OTHER PARTYS REPRESENTATIVES OF ANY DOCUMENT OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE FOREGOING. 

  

 Section 8.5 AMENDMENTS. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by the Holly Board and the Frontier Board, at any time before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of Holly or Frontier, but after any such stockholder approval, no amendment shall be made which by law requires the further approval of stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

 Section 8.6 GOVERNING LAW; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SUBSTANTIVE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE (WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES) EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE WBCA ARE MANDATORILY APPLICABLE. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 Section 8.10 WAIVERS. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

  

 Section 8.11 SEVERABILITY. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

 Section 8.12 SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT. The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that 

   ##### 

  

  

monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor
and therefore fully intend for specific performance to be the principal
remedy for breaches of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 7, the parties (on
behalf of themselves and the third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement)
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 8.13(a), without proof
of actual damages, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further agree not to assert that
a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law
or inequitable for any reason, nor to object to a remedy of specific
performance on the basis that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy for any such breach. Each party further acknowledges and
agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 8.12 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without
these agreements, the other parties would not enter into this Agreement. Each
party further agrees that no other party hereto or any other Person shall be
required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in
connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this
Section 8.12, and each party hereto irrevocably waives any right it may have
to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar
instrument. 

   

 Section 8.13 JURISDICTION. Each of the parties hereto hereby (a) agrees that any claim, suit, action or other proceeding, directly or indirectly, arising out of, under or relating to this Agreement, its negotiation or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, will be heard and determined in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware (and each agrees that no such claim, action, suit or other proceeding relating to this Agreement will be brought by it or any of its Affiliates except in such court), subject to any appeal, provided that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, then any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding may be brought in any Delaware state court or any federal court located in the State of Delaware and (b) irrevocably and unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding and irrevocably and unconditionally waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Persons respective address set forth in Section 8.2 will be effective service of process for any claim, action, suit or other proceeding in Delaware with respect to any matters to which it has submitted to jurisdiction as set forth above in the immediately preceding sentence. The parties hereto hereby agree that a final judgment in any such claim, suit, action or other proceeding will be conclusive, subject to any appeal, and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable law. In connection with any such proceeding that results in a judgment, the non-prevailing party will pay the prevailing party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in connection with such proceeding. 

  

 Section 8.14 LIMITATION ON DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT FOR PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES. 

    ##### 

 

   

 Section 8.15 OBLIGATION OF MERGER SUB. Whenever this Agreement requires Merger Sub (or any successors) to take any action prior to the Effective Time, such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Holly to cause such action to be taken and a guarantee of the performance thereof. 

  

 Section 8.16 EXTENSION; WAIVER. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each party may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party.

Stockholders Meetings 

  

 Section 1\. _Place of Meetings_. The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and any special meetings of stockholders shall be held at such time and place as shall be stated in the notice of such meeting. 

  

 Section 2\. _Annual Meetings_. The annual meeting of the stockholders for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business properly presented for action at such meeting shall be held on the second Thursday in May of each year or on such other day as may be fixed by resolution of the Board; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Board deems it impracticable to hold the meeting on the date originally determined, such annual meeting shall be held as soon as practicable after such date on a date to be specified in a resolution of the Board. 

  

 At an annual meeting, only such business shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been brought before the annual meeting (i) by, or at the direction of, the Board or (ii) by any stockholder of the Corporation who complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2 or, with respect to the election of directors, Section 11 of Article III of these By-Laws. For a proposal to be properly brought before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the Secretary of the Corporation. To be timely, a stockholders notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than 120 calendar days nor more than 150 calendar days before the anniversary date of the corporations proxy statement released to stockholders in connection with the prior years annual meeting. However, if no annual meeting was held in the previous year, or if the date of the applicable 

   ##### 

  

 

annual meeting has been changed by more than 30 days from the date
contemplated at the time of the previous years proxy statement, a
stockholders notice must be received by the Secretary not later than 60 days
before the date the Corporation commences mailing of its proxy materials
in connection with the applicable annual meeting. In no event shall the
public announcement of an adjournment of an annual meeting commence a new
time period for the giving of a stockholders notice as described above. A
stockholders notice to the Secretary shall set forth as to each matter the
stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (i) a brief
description of the proposal desired to be brought before the annual meeting,
including the complete text of any resolutions intended to be submitted at
the annual meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the annual
meeting, (ii) the name and address, as they appear on the
Corporations books, of the stockholder proposing such matter and any other
stockholders known by such stockholder to be supporting such proposal, (iii)
the class and number of shares of the Corporations stock which are
beneficially owned by the stockholder on the date of such stockholders
notice and by any other stockholders known by such stockholder to be
supporting such proposal on the date of such stockholders notice, and (iv)
any financial interest of the stockholder in such proposal. In addition, a
stockholder seeking to submit such proposal at the meeting shall promptly
provide any other information reasonably requested by the Corporation. 

   

 Except as otherwise provided by law, at any time following the Corporations receipt of a proposal, the Chairman of the Board (or other presiding officer at an annual meeting) shall have the power to determine whether any matter proposed to be brought before the annual meeting was proposed in accordance with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 2 and if any proposal is not in compliance with this Section 2, the Chairman of the Board (or such other presiding officer) may exclude such proposal from the annual meeting. 

  

 Notwithstanding the forgoing provisions of this Section 2, a stockholder who seeks to have any proposal included in the Corporations proxy materials shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 

  

 In the event a proposal is presented for action at such annual meeting which, in the opinion of the ranking executive officer of the Corporation attending such meeting, requires the giving of prior notice of such business to stockholders, no action shall be taken on such proposal at such meeting unless and until proof of timely and adequate notice of such proposal shall have been filed with and accepted by the ranking executive officer of the Corporation attending such meeting. 

  

 Section 3\. _Special Meetings_. Special meetings of the stockholders may be called by the Chief Executive Officer, and shall be called by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice President, the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary, at the request in writing of a majority of the Board, or of a majority of the Executive Committee, or of stockholders owning a majority of the outstanding shares having voting power. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the proposed meeting. 

  

 Section 4\. _Notice_. Notice of all stockholders meetings stating the time and place, and, in the case of special meetings, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered personally or mailed to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting not 

   ##### 

  

 

less than 30 nor more than 60 days before the meeting of stockholders is to be
held, unless the stockholders meeting is called by the Chairman of the
Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the President, a Vice President, the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, at the request in
writing of a majority of the Board, in which case such notice shall be
delivered not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the meeting of
stockholders is to be held. If mailed, notice shall be directed to the
stockholder at his last known post office address as the same appears on the
stock records of the Corporation. 

   

 Section 5\. _Proxies_. At any meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder entitled to vote may vote either in person or by proxy, but no proxy shall be voted on after three years from its date, unless such proxy shall, on its face, name a longer period for which it is to remain in force. Each proxy either (a) shall be authorized in writing, subscribed by the stockholder or his duly authorized attorney, but need not be sealed, witnessed or acknowledged, and shall be filed with the Secretary at or before the meeting, or (b) shall be authorized by means of an electronic transmission as permitted by law and shall be filed in accordance with the procedure established for the meeting. 

  

 Section 6\. _Quorum_. At any annual or special meeting of stockholders a majority in interest of the stockholders entitled to vote thereat, present in person or by proxy, shall constitute a quorum, except as otherwise provided by law, but if at any meeting of the stockholders there be less than a quorum present, the stockholders present at such meeting may, without further notice, adjourn the same from time to time until a quorum shall attend, but no business shall be transacted at any such adjourned meeting except such as might have been lawfully transacted had the meeting not been adjourned. 

  

 Section 7\. _Voting_. Except as otherwise expressly required by statute, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, each stockholder shall at each meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote in person or by proxy for each share of stock of the Corporation entitled to be voted thereat held by him and registered in his name on the books of the Corporation 

  

 (a) on such date as may be fixed pursuant to Article VIII of these By-Laws as the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting; or 

   

 (b) in the event that no record date shall have been so fixed, on the date of such meeting; provided, however, that, except where a record date shall have been so fixed, no share of stock of the Corporation shall be voted at any election of directors which shall have been transferred on the books of the Corporation within 20 days prior to such election of directors. 

   

 The vote for directors and, upon the demand of any stockholder, the vote upon any question before the meeting shall be by ballot. Except as otherwise provided by law or the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, directors shall be elected by a plurality vote of the stockholders present or represented at the meeting, and each other question properly presented to any meeting of stockholders shall be decided by a majority of the votes cast on the question entitled to vote thereon. The date and time of the opening and the closing of the polls for each 

   ##### 

  

 

matter upon which the stockholders will vote at any meeting of stockholders
shall be announced at the meeting by the Chairman of the Board (or other
presiding officer of the Corporation). 

   

 Section 8\. _List of Stockholders_. A complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the ensuing election, arranged in alphabetical order, with the residence of each, and the number of voting shares held by each, shall be prepared and filed in the office where the election is to be held at least 10 days before every election, and shall at all times during the usual hours for business during the said 10 days and during the whole time of said election be open to the examination of any stockholder. 

  

 Section 9\. _Judges of Election_. Whenever a vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be by ballot, the polls shall be opened and closed, the proxies and ballots shall be received, and all questions pertaining to the qualification of voters and the validity of proxies and the acceptance or rejection of votes shall be decided by two Judges of Election. Such Judges of Election shall be appointed by the Board before or at the meeting, or in default thereof, by the officer presiding at the meeting, and shall be sworn to the faithful performance of their duties. If any Judge of Election previously appointed shall fail to attend or refuse or be unable to serve, a substitute shall be appointed by the presiding officer. 

  

 Section 10\. _Consent Notice_. In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders authorize or take corporate action by written consent shall, by written notice to the Secretary of the Corporation, request the Board to fix a record date. The Board shall promptly, but in all events within 10 days after the date on which such a request is received, adopt a resolution fixing the record date. If no record date has been fixed by the Board within 10 days of the date on which such a request is received, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or any officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings for stockholder meetings are recorded, to the attention of the Secretary of the Corporation. Delivery shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior action by the Board is required by applicable law, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the date on which the Board adopts a resolution taking such prior action.

nomination of any such person at the annual meeting. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 11, a stockholder shall also comply with

 Section 12\. _Board Action By Written Consent In Lieu of Meeting_. Action required or permitted by applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws to be taken at a meeting of the Board may be taken without a meeting if the action is taken by all members of the Board. The action shall be evidenced by one or more written consents describing the action taken, signed, either manually, in facsimile or electronically, by each director, and included in the minutes or filed with the corporate records reflecting the action taken. Action taken under this Section 12 is effective when the last director signs the consent, unless the consent specifies a different effective date.

The Chairman of the Board shall preside at all meetings of stockholders and of the Board, and shall advise and counsel the officers of the Corporation and shall have and perform such duties as usually devolve upon his role and such other duties as are prescribed by these By-Laws and by the Board. The Vice Chairman of the Board shall, in the absence of the Chairman of the Board, preside at all meetings of stockholders and of the Board, and exercise and discharge the responsibilities and duties of the Chairman of the Board.

Terms of members of the Executive Committee shall be at the pleasure of the Board but only while a member remains a director. If the Chairman of the Board is a member of the Executive Committee, he shall be Chairman of the Committee; otherwise, the Chairman of the Executive Committee shall be the Chief Executive Officer if he is a member of the Executive Committee or, if the Chief Executive Officer is not a member of the Executive Committee, the President shall be the Chairman of the Executive Committee. To the extent permitted by law or except as otherwise provided by this Section 1 or by resolution of the Board, during the intervals between meetings of the Board, the Executive Committee shall possess and may exercise all of the powers of the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation. An action of the Executive Committee taken within the scope of its authority shall be an act of the Board. All action taken by the Executive Committee shall be reported to the Board at its regular meeting next succeeding such action, but failure to so render such report shall not invalidate any such action. Vacancies in the Executive Committee shall be filled by the Board, but during the temporary absence of a member of the Executive Committee, the 

   ##### 

  

 

remaining members of the Executive Committee may appoint a member of the Board
to act in the place of such absent member. 

   

 Section 2\. _Meetings and Records of Executive Committee_. Subject to the provisions of these By-Laws, the Executive Committee shall fix its own rules of procedure and shall meet as provided by such rules or by resolution of the Board, and it shall also meet at the call of the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive Officer or the President of the Corporation or of any two members of the Committee. Notice of meetings of the Executive Committee may be given orally, by telephone, or in any other manner that reasonably assures receipt thereof and no minimum advance notice shall be required. No notice shall be required for any meeting of the Executive Committee in which a majority of its members participate, action may be taken by the Executive Committee in any manner permitted for directors actions or meetings under Delaware law, and action taken by a majority of the members of the Executive Committee shall constitute the action of the Executive Committee.

 Section 3\. _Other Committees_. The Board may by resolution provide for such other standing or special committees as it deems desirable and discontinue the same at pleasure. Each such committee shall have such powers and perform such duties, not inconsistent with law, as may be assigned to it by the Board. If provision be made for any such committee, the members thereof shall be appointed by the Board and shall serve during the pleasure of the Board. Vacancies on such committees shall be filled by the Board. Section 2 of this ARTICLE IV shall also apply to the meetings of such other committees mutatis mutandis.
