not available to the public on the SEC&#146;s EDGAR website) to Holly each registration statement,
report, proxy statement or information statement (other than preliminary materials) filed by
Frontier with the SEC since December&nbsp;31, 2007, each in the form (including exhibits and any
amendments thereto) filed with the SEC prior to the date of this Agreement (collectively, the
&#147;<U>Frontier Reports</U>&#148;). Frontier has filed all forms, reports and documents required to be
filed by it with the SEC pursuant to relevant securities statutes, regulations, policies and rules
since such time. As of their respective dates, the Frontier Reports (i)&nbsp;were prepared in
accordance with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations thereunder in all material respects and (ii)&nbsp;did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading at the time such statements were made. Except for the
Subsidiaries of Frontier that guarantee Frontier&#146;s outstanding 8.50% Senior Notes and 6.875% Senior
Notes, none of the Subsidiaries of Frontier is required to make any filings with the SEC. Each of
the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Frontier Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated financial position of Frontier and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the
consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders&#146; equity included in or
incorporated by reference into the Frontier Reports (including any related notes and schedules)
fairly presents in all material respects the results of consolidated operations, cash flows or
changes in shareholders&#146; equity, as the case may be, of Frontier and its Subsidiaries for the
periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to such exceptions as may
be permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC), and in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein, and except that the unaudited
interim financial statements were or are subject to normal and recurring year-end adjustments which
were not or are not expected to be material in amount or effect.

foreign commission, court, board, bureau, agency or instrumentality, other than those that would
not have or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Frontier Material
Adverse Effect. There are no outstanding judgments, decrees, injunctions, awards or orders against

shall cause Surviving Corporation to pay, as incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by

final disposition of any such Action to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, and, if
required, upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable law, and (ii)&nbsp;Holly will, and will
cause Surviving Corporation to, cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however,
neither Holly nor Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and provided further
that neither Holly nor Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this Section&nbsp;5.11(a) to

Indemnified Parties in any single Action, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the
Indemnified Parties, there is or may be a conflict of interest between two or more of such
Indemnified Parties, in which case there may be separate counsel for each similarly situated group.
With respect to any determination of whether an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
by Surviving Corporation under this Section&nbsp;5.11, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, as
contemplated by the WBCA, to require that such determination be made by special legal counsel
selected by the Indemnified Party and approved by Surviving Corporation (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld), and who has not otherwise performed material services for Frontier,
Holly or the Indemnified Party within the last three (3)&nbsp;years.
