W I T N E S S E T H : 

   

 WHEREAS, the parties intend that Merger Sub be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving that merger upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

 WHEREAS, the Board of Managers of Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, and Board of Directors of Merger Sub, have adopted and approved this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a condition of the Company entering into this Agreement; Providence Equity Partners VI L.P. and Providence Equity Partners VI-A L.P. (together, the " _Guarantors_ ") are entering into a guarantee in favor of the Company (the " _Guarantee_ ") pursuant to which the Guarantors are guaranteeing certain of the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement as set forth in the Guarantee; 

  

 WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parents and Merger Subs entering into this Agreement, certain Stockholders have entered into a Voting Agreement with the Parent and Merger Sub (the " _Voting Agreement_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also to prescribe certain conditions to the Merger. 

  

 NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual agreements, covenants, representations and warranties herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 
 THE MERGER 

   

 SECTION 1.01 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate 

   ##### 

  

 

corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue

owned subsidiary of Parent and shall succeed to and assume all the rights and
obligations of Merger Sub in accordance with the DGCL. 

   

 SECTION 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., Minneapolis, Minnesota time, on the date (the " _Closing Date_ ") that is the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied on the Closing Date but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Oppenheimer Wolff and Donnelly LLP, Plaza VII, Suite 3300, 45 South Seventh Street, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean each day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day when commercial banks in New York, New York are authorized or required by Law to close. 

  

 SECTION 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall prepare and execute a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and the Surviving Corporation shall file the same with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent time or date as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 SECTION 1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The effects of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation, all as provided under the applicable Laws of the State of Delaware. If at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary to vest in the Surviving Corporation the title to all property or rights of Merger Sub or the Company, the authorized officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized in the name of Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to take, and shall take, any and all such lawful action. 

  

 SECTION 1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. 

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in the Merger to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit A_ hereto and, as so amended and restated, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company as the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in the Merger to conform in their entirety to the bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that all references to "Merger Sub" in the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be changed to refer 

      ##### 

  

    

to "Virtual Radiologic Corporation") and as set forth in _Exhibit B_ hereto
and, as so amended and restated, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law. 

   

 SECTION 1.06 _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take, and cause to be taken, all actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and the bylaws. 

  

 SECTION 1.07 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and the bylaws. 

  

ARTICLE II 
 CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; MERGER CONSIDERATION 

   

 SECTION 2.01 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub: 

  

 (a) _Cancellation of Parent and Merger Sub Owned Company Common Stock; Treasury Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent or by the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (not including, however, those shares of Company Common Stock canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_ and Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into and become the right to receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $17.25 (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). All shares of Company Common Stock that have been converted in the Merger into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist, and the holders of Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.02_ of this Agreement. 

   

 (c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time. 

    ##### 

  

  

 (d) _Stock Options and Restricted Stock_. 

   

 (i) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option shall be accelerated in full so that it becomes fully vested as of the Effective Time and shall without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Stock Option (an " _Optionholder_ ") be canceled and the Optionholder will receive as soon as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time a cash payment (without interest) with respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option and (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option (collectively, the " _Option Consideration_ "). (For the avoidance of doubt, each Company Stock Option with an exercise price at or above the Merger Consideration shall be canceled without any right to receive any consideration therefor.) The Option Consideration shall be reduced by any withholding or other Taxes that may be due as a result of the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.01_. 

  

 (ii) As of the Effective Time, the restrictions on each restricted share of Company Common Stock (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ") granted and then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, lapse immediately prior to the Effective Time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested in each holder thereof at such time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights, including the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and be subject to the same conditions as, each share of Company Common Stock not subject to any restrictions. 

  

 (iii) The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") or compensation committee of the Company Board shall make such amendments and adjustments to make such determinations with respect to, and cause to be taken such actions with respect to, the Company Stock Options and Company Restricted Stock as are necessary and legally permissible to implement the provisions of this _Section 2.01_. 

  

 SECTION 2.02 _Payment Procedures_. 

  

 (a) _Parent to Make Merger Consideration and Option Consideration Available_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") in a separate fund (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), for the benefit of (x) the holders of certificates or evidence of shares in book-entry form which immediately prior to the Effective Time evidence shares of Company Common Stock (each a " _Certificate_ ") and (y) Optionholders, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Option Consideration (collectively, the " _Aggregate Consideration_ "), and (ii) instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the Aggregate Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. The Aggregate Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent pursuant to this _Section 2.02_ shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such investment or any payment of earnings from any such investment shall not (a) delay the receipt by the holders of record of the Certificates of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders rights hereunder, or (b) delay the receipt by the Optionholders of the Option Consideration or otherwise impair such holders rights hereunder. Any interest or income produced by such investments 

      ##### 

  

    

shall not be deemed part of the Exchange Fund and shall be payable to the
Surviving Corporation. In the event that the funds in the Exchange Fund shall
be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 2.01_, Parent
shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the
Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount
required to make such payment. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund
to be (i) held for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock and Company Stock Options and (ii) applied promptly to making the
payments provided for in _Section 2.01_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used
for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options; Transfer Books_. The Merger Consideration and the Option Consideration paid by the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of this _Section 2.02_ upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock (including the Company Restricted Stock) or Company Stock Options, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Option, as applicable, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in _Section 2.03_. 

   

 SECTION 2.03 _Exchange of Shares; Cancellation of Options_. 

  

 (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Certificate a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration that such former holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.01_, in each case, in respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.03_, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. 

   

 (b) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to any Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it shall be a condition of the payment thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Paying Agent in advance of any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to any Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason relating to such holder or requesting Person, or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall provide notice to each Optionholder which includes (i) a description of the treatment of the Company Stock Options in accordance with _Section 2.01(d)_ and (ii) payment of the Option Consideration that such Person has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.01(d)_ in respect of such Optionholders Company Stock Options. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Stockholders or Optionholders for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be paid, at the request of Parent, to Parent. Any Stockholder or Optionholder who has not theretofore complied with this _Section 2.03_ or, with respect to the Optionholders, has not received their Option Consideration, shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of the Merger Consideration or Option Consideration payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Option held by such Person at the Effective Time as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, none of Parent, the Company, the Paying Agent, Merger Sub or any other Person shall be liable to any former Stockholder or Optionholder for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

   

 (e) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary (such amount, however, not to exceed 20% of the Merger Consideration that the Person is entitled to receive in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

 (f) Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Stock Options such amounts as Parent, or any Affiliate thereof, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any applicable provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax Law. To the extent that such amounts are properly withheld by Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, (i) Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent will promptly pay such withheld amounts to the appropriate taxing authority, and (ii) such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Stockholder or Optionholder in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by Parent, Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 SECTION 2.04 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, in the event that the Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change. 

   ##### 

  

  

       |   | SECTION 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.

As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, cause the Continuing Employees to commence participation in such Parent Plans as are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent. From and after the Effective Time until the one year anniversary of the Effective Time and unless otherwise mutually agreed to by the parties in writing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among the

In the event any Claim is brought against any Indemnified Party, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall each use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of such matter, provided that neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any Claim (and in which indemnification could be sought by such Indemnified Party hereunder) without the prior written consent of such Indemnified Party if and to the extent the claimant seeks any non-monetary relief from such Indemnified Party, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The indemnification and advancement obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this _Section 5.09(a)_ shall extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim relating thereto (including with respect

conferred hereunder shall continue as to an individual who has ceased to be a
director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective
Time and shall inure to the benefit of such individuals heirs, executors and
personal and legal representatives. In connection with any determination as
to whether the Indemnified Parties are entitled to the benefits of this
_Section 5.09_, the burden of proof shall be on Parent and the
Surviving Corporation to establish that an Indemnified Party is not so
entitled. As used in this  _Section 5.09(a)_, (i) the term " _Claim_ " means
any threatened, asserted, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, or
any inquiry or investigation, whether instituted by the Company, any
Governmental Entity or any other party, that any Indemnified Party in good
faith believes might lead to the institution of any such action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other,
including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism,
arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified
Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent,
or fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any employee benefit
plan maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the Effective Time and

participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend,
be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is
authorized pursuant to this  _Section 5.09(a)_, including any action

Indemnified Party. 

   

 (b) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this _Section 5.09_, from and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall keep in full force and effect, and comply with the terms and conditions of, any agreement in effect as of the date of this Agreement between or among the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any Indemnified Party providing for the indemnification of such Indemnified Party. 

   

 (c) Without limiting any of the obligations under paragraph (a) of this _Section 5.09_, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and all limitations of liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the Companys certificate of incorporation or bylaws or in the corresponding documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries as in effect as of the date of this Agreement with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Effective Time shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect thereafter, without any amendment thereto. 

   

 (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be (including Parents ultimate parent entity, if applicable), assume all of the obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation set forth in this _Section 5.09_. 

   ##### 

  

    

 (e) As of the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Company (with the election being at Parents option) shall have purchased and shall maintain in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date (or, if any Claim is asserted or made within such six-year period, Parent shall ensure that such insurance remains in effect until final disposition of such Claim) a prepaid directors and officers liability insurance policy or policies providing each individual currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability insurance coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including acts or omissions relating to the approval of this Agreement and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are in the aggregate no less advantageous to such directors and officers of the Company than the terms and conditions of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company from reputable carriers having a rating comparable to the Companys current carrier. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this _Section 5.09_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.09_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified Party under this _Section 5.09_ without the consent of such affected Indemnified Party. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section 5.09_. 

   

 SECTION 5.10 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, and shall cause their respective officers, directors, representatives and agents (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, " _Company Representatives_ ") to, (i) immediately cease any existing discussions or negotiations, if any, with any third Person that may be ongoing with respect to any actual or potential Acquisition Proposal and (ii) with respect to parties with whom discussions have been terminated, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the return or the destruction of, in accordance with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement, confidential information previously furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or Company Representatives. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any Company Representative to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) furnish or disclose to any third Person non-public information with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) negotiate or engage in discussions with any third Person with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (other than to advise such Person of the Companys obligations under this _Section 5.10_) or (iv) enter into any agreement (whether or not binding) or agreement in principle with respect to, or approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Merger by the Company Required Vote (but not thereafter), in response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was not solicited by the Company or any of its Representatives and which the Company Board determines in good faith, after consulting with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, constitutes, or could reasonably 

   ##### 

  

   

be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Affiliated
Medical Practices to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its
officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel,
advisors, agents and other representatives), and (B) participate in
discussions or negotiations with, and provide draft documents and agreements
to, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal (and its officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, advisors, agents and
other representatives) regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if (prior to
furnishing such information to, or entering into such discussions or
negotiations with, such Person) the Company (1) provides reasonable prior
notice to Parent to the effect that it is furnishing information to, or
entering into discussions or negotiations with, such Person (but excluding
the identity of such Person), (2) provides Parent with all information to be
provided to such Person which Parent has not previously been provided, and
(3) receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement reasonably satisfactory to the Company Board and with terms
substantially similar to and no less favorable to the Company, in the
aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (b) Except as set forth in this _Section 5.10(b)_, neither the Company Board or any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, withhold or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify, withhold or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) enter into any agreement (whether or not binding) or agreement in principle with respect to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in _Section 5.10(a)_) or (iv) take any other action or make any recommendation or public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer or otherwise take any action inconsistent with the Company Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, at any time prior to obtaining approval of the Merger by the Company Required Vote, the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to do so would violate its fiduciary duties to the Stockholders under applicable Law, then the Company Board may withdraw, modify, or change in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation (a " _Company Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such action is (A) not in response to a Superior Proposal, then a Company Recommendation Change may only be made if directly related to an event, fact, circumstance, development or occurrence that affects the assets or operations of the Company that is unknown to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement but becomes known to the Company Board prior to obtaining approval of the Merger by the Company Required Vote or (B) in response to a Superior Proposal (that was not solicited in breach of this _Section 5.10_) as determined by the Company Board in good faith after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, prior to making any Company Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement in accordance with _Section 7.01(d_), the Company shall, in all such cases, provide Parent with at least three (3) Business Days advance written notice (such period, the _"Notice Period"_ ), advising Parent of its intention to make a Company Recommendation Change or to terminate the Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (ii) provide Parent in writing the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and a copy of the relevant proposed transaction documents with the party making such Superior Proposal and other material documents (but excluding the identity of such Person) and (iii) discuss with Parent, to the extent Parent wishes to discuss, any proposed changes by Parent to the terms of this Agreement as to permit the Company not to effect a Company Recommendation or 

   ##### 

  

   

to terminate this Agreement in response to such a Superior Proposal and
following the Notice Period, and taking into account any revised proposal
made by Parent since the commencement of the Notice Period, determines in
good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors that the Company Board is required to make a Company Recommendation
Change in the exercise of its fiduciary duties, and if it is in connection
with a Superior Proposal, the Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal.
In the event of any material change to the material terms of such Superior
Proposal (any change in price shall be deemed a material change of a material
term), the Company Board shall deliver to Parent an additional notice and

 (ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal (with all of the percentages included in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to fifty percent (50%)) on terms which the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel and consideration of all terms and conditions of such

Acquisition Proposal, including the conditionality and the timing and

 SECTION 5.13 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to render such Takeover Statute inapplicable to the foregoing. " _Takeover Statute_ " shall mean any restrictive provision of any applicable "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "interested stockholder" or other similar anti-takeover Law, including Section 203 of the DGCL. 

  

 SECTION 5.14 _Section 16 Matters_.

 SECTION 5.16 _Additional Agreements_. In case at any time after the Effective Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of either of the Company or Merger Sub, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such necessary action.

  ##### 

  

    

consummate the Merger set forth in _Article VI_ prior to the Outside
Termination Date, or (B) the failure of the Effective Time to have occurred

   ##### 

  

    

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.01(c_) or  _Section 7.01(g_), the Company shall reimburse Parent or its designee for the documented reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby up to an aggregate amount of $2,400,000, by wire transfer of immediately available funds not later than five (5) Business Days after delivery to the Company of an itemization setting forth in reasonable detail all such reimbursable expenses; provided that any amounts paid by the Company of Parent pursuant to this _Section 7.02(b_) shall reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis any Company Termination Fee that becomes due and payable pursuant to _Section 7.02(a_). The parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement under circumstances where a Company Termination Fee is payable are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to _Section 7.02(a)_ are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this _Section 7.02_, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement.

 MISCELLANEOUS 

   

 SECTION 9.01 _Non-survival of Representations and Warranties_. None of the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Effective Time.

 SECTION 9.02 _Publicity_. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing any press release with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the circumstances) issue such press release or make such public statement or SEC filing as may upon the advice of outside counsel be required by Law or the rules and regulations of any applicable stock exchange (including the Nasdaq Stock Market). The parties have agreed upon the form of a joint press release announcing the Merger and the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 SECTION 9.03 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each party will bear its own expenses and costs incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, whether or not such transactions will be consummated (for the sake of clarity, Parent shall be responsible for the HSR Act filing fees). 

  

 SECTION 9.04 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto, the Guarantee and the Voting Agreement, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement by and among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior negotiations, agreements and understandings among such parties. 

  

 SECTION 9.05 _Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations of any party hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in _Section 5.09_ (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) or _Section 9.09_ (Enforcement), this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder. 

  

 SECTION 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, including the validity hereof and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder, and all amendments and supplements hereof and all waivers and consents hereunder, shall be construed in accordance with and governed by the domestic substantive laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice of law or conflicts of law provision or rule that would cause the application of the domestic substantive laws of any other jurisdiction. The parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the non-exclusive 

   ##### 

  

 

jurisdiction of any federal or state court located within the State of
Delaware over any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby and each party hereby irrevocably
agrees that all claims in respect of such dispute or any suit, action or
proceeding related thereto may be heard and determined in such courts. The
parties hereby irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any objection which they may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such dispute brought in such court or any defense
of inconvenient forum for the maintenance of such dispute. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that a judgment in any such dispute may be enforced in
other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law. 

   

 SECTION 9.07 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult issues and, therefore, each such party irrevocably and unconditionally waives any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any legal action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement certifies and acknowledges that (a) no representative of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not seek to enforce the foregoing waiver in the event of a legal action, (b) such party has considered the implications of this waiver, (c) such party makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) such party has been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 9.07_. 

  

 SECTION 9.08 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or provision with a valid, legal and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable term. 

  

 SECTION 9.09 _Enforcement_. 

  

 (a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the obligation to consummate the Merger, subject in each case to the terms and conditions of this Agreement), including an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub each hereby waive (a) any defenses in any action for specific performance, including the defense that a remedy at Law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. In addition, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in 

   #####

breach or wrongful repudiation of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub,
the actual damages incurred by the Company for purposes of determining
damages to the extent available as a remedy to the Company under _Section
9.09(c_) would include the actual damages incurred by the Companys
stockholders in the event such stockholders would not receive the benefit of
the bargain negotiated by the Company on their behalf as set forth in this
Agreement. 

   

 (b) The Company hereby agrees that specific performance as provided for in _Section 9.09(a_ ) shall be its sole and exclusive remedy with respect to breaches by Parent, Merger Sub, or any other Person or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (whether in contract, tort or otherwise) and except as provided in _Section 9.09(c_) below, that it may not seek or accept any other form of relief that may be available for breach under this Agreement or otherwise in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including monetary damages). 

   

 (c) If a court of competent jurisdiction has declined to specifically enforce the obligations of Parent to consummate the Merger pursuant to a claim for specific performance brought against Parent pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ and has instead granted an award of damages for such alleged breach against Parent, the Company may enforce such award and accept damages for such alleged breach only if, within two (2) weeks following such determination the Company confirms to Parent in writing that it is prepared and willing to consummate the Merger in accordance with this Agreement, and Parent is not willing to consummate the Merger within such two (2) week period in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. In addition, the Company agrees to cause any legal proceeding still proceeding to be dismissed with prejudice at such time as Parent consummates the Merger in accordance with Article II of this Agreement or is otherwise willing to do so. 

   

 SECTION 9.10 _Captions_. The headings and captions used in this Agreement are used for convenience only and are not to be considered in construing or interpreting this Agreement.
