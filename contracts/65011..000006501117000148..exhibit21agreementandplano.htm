ARTICLE II

THE OFFER

Section 2.1 Terms and Conditions of the Offer.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and provided that
this Agreement shall not have been terminated pursuant to Section 10.1, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof (but in no event more than ten
(10) Business Days thereafter), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to) commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the
Exchange Act) the Offer. In the Offer, each share of Company Stock accepted by
Purchaser in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the
Offer



shall be exchanged for the right to receive the Offer Consideration, subject
to the other provisions of this Article II. The Offer shall be made by means
of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that is disseminated to all
of the holders of shares of Company Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act and
contains the terms and conditions of the Offer as set forth in this Agreement
and in Annex A. Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
consummate the Offer subject to the terms and conditions hereof and thereof.
The Offer shall be subject only to:

(i) the condition that, prior to the expiration of the Offer, there being
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in accordance with the terms of
the Offer a number of shares of Company Stock that, together with the shares
(if any) of Company Stock then owned by Parent and Purchaser or any of their
Subsidiaries (excluding shares of Company Stock tendered pursuant to
guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been "received," as such term
is defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL, by the depositary for the Offer
pursuant to such procedures), represents a majority of all outstanding shares
of Company Stock at the time of the expiration of the Offer (the "Minimum
Condition"); and

(ii) the other conditions set forth in Annex A.

(b) Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive or modify any of the
conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of, or conditions
to, the Offer; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of
the Company in its sole discretion, Purchaser may not (and Parent shall not
permit Purchaser to) (i) waive any of the conditions set forth in clauses (a),
(b), (c), or (d)(vi) of Annex A, (ii) make any change in the terms of or
conditions to the Offer that (A) changes the form or amount of consideration
to be paid in the Offer (provided, however, that Purchaser may increase the
amount of such consideration, but in no event shall such increase reduce the
Offer Consideration and provided that such increase is not for the primary
purpose of delaying the Acceptance Time), (B) decreases the number of shares
of Company Stock sought in the Offer, (C) extends the Offer, other than in a
manner required or permitted by the provisions of Section 2.2(b), (D) imposes
conditions to the Offer other than those set forth in Annex A or (E) amends or
modifies any other term of or any condition to the Offer in any manner that is
adverse to the holders of shares of Company Stock or (iii) provide for a
"subsequent offering period" within the meaning of Rule 14d-11 under the
Exchange Act.

Section 2.2 Expiration and Extension of the Offer.

(a) Unless the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with Section
2.2(b), the Offer shall expire at midnight, Eastern Time (i.e., one minute
after 11:59 p.m., Eastern Time), on the date that is 20 Business Days (for
this purpose calculated in accordance with Section 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated
under the Exchange Act) after the date that the Offer is first commenced
(within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act). In the
event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at the time to which
the Offer has been so extended (such date and time that the Offer expires, the
"Expiration Date").



(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.2(a) or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement:

(i) Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
any period required by any Law, or any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or its staff or the NYSE, in any such case, which is
applicable to the Offer or the Merger and until any waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the HSR
Act relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall have
expired or been terminated;

(ii) in the event that any condition to the Offer (including the Minimum
Condition) has not been satisfied or waived as of any then scheduled
expiration of the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
extend the Offer for successive extension periods of up to ten Business Days
each in order to further seek the satisfaction of the conditions to the Offer
(including the Minimum Condition); and

(iii) if, on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, the Marketing
Period has not expired, then Parent shall have the right, in its sole
discretion, to extend the Offer until the first Business Day following the end
of the Marketing Period, so long as no such extension would result in the
Offer being extended beyond the third (3rd) Business Day immediately preceding
the End Date;

provided, however, in each case that (x) any such extension shall not be
deemed to impair, limit, or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the
Parties to terminate this Agreement pursuant to the terms of Section 10.1 and
(y) Purchaser shall not be required (and Parent shall not be required to cause
Purchaser) to extend the Offer beyond the End Date.

(c) Neither Parent nor Purchaser shall terminate or withdraw the Offer prior
to the then scheduled expiration of the Offer without the prior written
consent of the Company unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Section 10.1, in which case Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer
promptly (but in no event more than one Business Day) after such termination
of this Agreement. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser, or
this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 10.1, prior to the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Stock tendered in the Offer,
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly return, and
shall cause any depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, all
tendered shares of Company Stock to the registered holders thereof.

Section 2.3 Payment for Company Stock. On the terms of and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and
Parent shall cause Purchaser to) irrevocably accept for purchase and payment
all shares of Company Stock that are validly tendered (and not validly
withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer promptly (within the meaning of Section
14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after the expiration of the Offer
(as it may be extended in accordance with Section 2.2(b)) and promptly
thereafter pay for such shares. The time at which Purchaser first irrevocably
accepts for purchase and payment the shares of Company Stock tendered pursuant
to the Offer is referred to as the "Acceptance Time". Without



limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any
shares of Company Stock that Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant
to the Offer; provided, however, that without the prior written consent of the
Company, Purchaser shall not accept for payment, or pay for, any shares of
Company Stock if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than the number of
shares of Company Stock necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. The Offer
Consideration shall be paid to the holder of each share of Company Stock
validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer subject to
reduction for any applicable withholding Taxes payable in respect thereof. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to register (and shall instruct
its transfer agent to register) the transfer of shares of Company Stock
irrevocably accepted for purchase and payment effective immediately after the
Acceptance Time.

corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). As a result of the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent.

(b) The Merger shall be effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall

10022, as soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time, and in any case
no later than the second Business Day following the satisfaction or, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article IX (except for any conditions that by their nature can only be
satisfied on the Closing



Date, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions or waiver by the
Party entitled to waive such conditions), unless another date, time or place
is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company.

Section 3.3 Effective Time. On the Closing Date, the Company shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger
relating to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"), executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at
such later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the "Effective
Time").

Section 3.4 Surviving Corporation Matters.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be amended and restated to read in its entirety as set forth on Exhibit
A hereto, and as so amended and restated shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until further amended in accordance
with applicable Law.

(b) At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated to read in their entirety as the bylaws of Purchaser as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except the references to
Purchaser's name shall be replaced by references to "Time Inc.", until further
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

(c) The Parties shall take all necessary action such that, from and after the
Effective Time, until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation, incapacity or removal:
(i) the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
officers of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.5 Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock of the Company and
Purchaser. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the Parties or any holder of any securities of the
Company or Purchaser:

(a) All shares of Company Stock that are owned, directly or indirectly, by
Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or otherwise) or
Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically
canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(b) Each share of Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares (i) to be canceled in accordance with
Section 3.5(a), or (ii) subject to the provisions of Section 3.7) shall at the
Effective Time be converted into the right to receive the Offer Consideration,
without interest and less any required withholding taxes (the "Merger
Consideration"), subject to the provisions of this Article III.



(c) At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 3.5 shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (i) a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
shares of Company Stock (a "Certificate") or (ii) shares of Company Stock held
in book-entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except (subject to Section 3.7) the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without interest, subject to compliance with the
procedures set forth in Section 3.8.

(d) Each share of capital stock of Purchaser issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.6 Certain Adjustments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a) the
Effective Time and (b) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 10.1, the outstanding shares of Company Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split),
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares, readjustment, or
other similar transaction, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with
a record date within said period, then the Merger Consideration and any other
similarly dependent items, as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted
to provide Parent and the holders of Company Stock (including Company Stock
Options exercisable for Company Stock) the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section
3.6 shall be construed to permit any Party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 3.7 Appraisal Shares. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares of Company Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares canceled in
accordance with Section 3.5(a)) and that are held by any Person who has not
tendered such shares in the Offer and is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
("Appraisal Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.5, but rather the holders of
Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving Corporation of
the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL; provided, however, that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be paid the "fair value" of
such holder's Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be
deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to have
become exchangeable solely for, the Merger Consideration as provided in
Section 3.5. The Company shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company. Following the Effective Time,
Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the



Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 3.8 Exchange of Company Stock.

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized bank or trust company designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"). At or
immediately following the Effective Time on the Closing Date, Parent shall
provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash in an
aggregate amount necessary to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration (the
"Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to
be issued pursuant to Section 3.5 out of the Exchange Fund. Except as provided
in Section 3.8(g), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.

(b) Exchange Procedures.

(i) Certificates. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any event not later
than the fifth Business Day following the Closing Date, to each holder of
record of a Certificate whose shares of Company Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.5, (x) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in customary form) and
(y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in exchange
thereof as promptly as practicable, cash in an amount equal to the Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of Company Stock previously
represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment
may be made and shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the
Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that
such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or
accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

(ii) Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article III. In



lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose
shares of Company Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.5 shall automatically upon the Effective
Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay
and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, cash in an
amount equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of shares of
Company Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, and the Book-
Entry Shares of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

(c) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article III upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Stock. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing
shares of Company Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article III.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Stock for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of its claim for
the Merger Consideration.

(e) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by former holders of Company Stock immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Authority shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or interest
of any Person previously entitled thereto.

(f) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable and customary amount as Parent
or the Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration had such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate been surrendered as provided in this Article III.

(g) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; provided, however, that no such investment income or gain
or loss thereon



shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Stock. Any interest,
gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be the sole and
exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part
of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of
holders of Company Stock; provided, further, that any investment of such cash
shall in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-
term obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moody's
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Company Stock pursuant to this Article III. If for any reason (including
losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy
all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange Fund in an
amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to
fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

Section 3.9 Further Assurances. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or Purchaser acquired or to be
acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with,
the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to take all such
actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or interest
in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Section 3.10 Treatment of Company Stock Options, Company RSUs, Company OPP
PSUs, Company PSUs and Company DSUs.

(a) Company Stock Options. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each then-outstanding and unexercised Company Stock Option, to the
extent then vested (including Company Stock Options that vest in connection
with the Merger or such holder's termination from the Company in connection
with the Merger) or otherwise designated by Parent, shall automatically be
canceled and converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the total number of
shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company Stock Option multiplied
by (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such Company Stock Option, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding. Each Company Stock Option that is
unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which has
not been designated for cancellation and a cash out as described above shall
be assumed by Parent (an "Assumed Option") on the same terms and conditions
(including applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each such Assumed
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that (x) the number of
shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Assumed Option shall equal the
product of the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option, multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the
nearest whole



number and (y) the per share exercise price of such Assumed Option will be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share at
which such Assumed Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded up to the nearest whole
cent. Assumed Options will remain subject to the terms of the applicable
Company Equity Plans and stock option agreements, except as necessary to
effectuate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In the event that
the exercise price of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the
Merger Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled, without any
consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or
effect.

(b) Company RSUs. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding Company RSU, to the extent then vested (including
Company RSUs that vest in connection with the Merger or such holder's
termination from the Company in connection with the Merger) or otherwise
designated by Parent, shall be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product
of (i) the total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such
Company RSU multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Each Company RSU that is
unvested and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
automatically be converted into a restricted stock unit ("Assumed RSU")
settled in Parent Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions (including
applicable vesting requirements) as applied to each such Company RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock underlying such Assumed RSU will be equal to the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Stock subject to the Company RSU,
multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded down to the
nearest whole number.

(c) Company OPP PSUs. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding and unvested Company OPP PSU shall (i) be deemed earned
based on the Merger Consideration as contemplated by the terms of such Company
OPP PSU and (ii) to the extent so earned, become fully vested and converted
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash
equal to the product of (x) the total number of shares of Company Stock then
underlying such Company OPP PSU multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration,
without any interest thereon and subject to all applicable withholding. Each
Company OPP PSU that remains unearned based on the Merger Consideration as of
the Effective Time shall be canceled, without any consideration being payable
in respect thereof, and have no further force or effect.

(d) Company PSUs. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each then-outstanding and unvested Company PSU shall, to the extent then
vested (including Company PSUs that vest in connection with the Merger or such
holder's termination from the Company in connection with the Merger) or
otherwise designated by Parent, be canceled and converted into the right to
receive from the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product
of (i) the total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such
Company PSU assuming achievement of performance at target multiplied by (ii)
the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and subject to all
applicable withholding. Each Company PSU that is unvested and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be



converted into a performance stock unit ("Assumed PSU") settled in Parent
Common Stock, on the same terms and conditions (including applicable vesting
requirements) as applied to each such Company PSU immediately prior to the
Effective Time, except that the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
underlying such Assumed PSU will be equal to the product of (x) the number of
shares of Company Stock subject to the Company PSU assuming achievement of
performance at target, multiplied by (y) the Exchange Ratio, with the result
rounded down to the nearest whole number.

(e) Company DSUs. Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each Company DSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall automatically be canceled and converted into the right to receive from
the Surviving Corporation an amount of cash equal to the product of (i) the
total number of shares of Company Stock then underlying such Company DSU
multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon and
subject to all applicable withholding.

(f) Parent Actions. Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for
delivery with respect to the Assumed Options, Assumed RSUs and the Assumed
PSUs in accordance with this Section 3.10. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a Form S-8 (or such
other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
necessary to fulfill Parent's obligations under this Section 3.10.

(g) Company Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions providing for the
treatment of the Company Stock Options, the Company RSUs, the Company OPP
PSUs, the Company PSUs and the Company DSUs contemplated by this Section 3.10.

(h) Non-U.S. Employees. Parent and the Company may agree to treat equity
compensation held by Employees subject to non-U.S. Law in a manner other than
that contemplated above in this Section 3.10 to the extent necessary to take
into account applicable non-U.S. Law or Tax or employment considerations.

Section 3.11 Withholding. Parent, Purchaser, the Company and the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any applicable provisions of state, local or foreign Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the applicable Taxing
Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

to carry on its business as now conducted and is duly qualified to do business
as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where

any failure to have such power or authority or to be so qualified would not

certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company, including all
amendments thereto, as in effect on the date of this Agreement.

Section 4.2 Corporate Authorization. The Company has all requisite corporate

enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,

the Company, the performance of its obligations hereunder and the consummation

binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise,
permit, certificate, approval or other similar authorization affecting the

materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate maintains, contributes to, or
sponsors (or has in the past six years maintained, contributed to, or
sponsored) a multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA (a
"Multiemployer Plan"). No U.S. Company Plan is a plan subject to Title IV of
ERISA. No U.S Company Plan provides post-employment health or welfare benefits
for any current or former Employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or
their dependents), other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code.

(f) Except for any instances of noncompliance that would not reasonably be
expected to result in a material liability to the Company or its Subsidiaries,
any arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is subject to
Section 409A of the Code has complied in form and operation with the
requirements of Section 409A of the Code as in effect from time to time.

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, either
alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former
director, officer or Employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries to severance
pay, unemployment compensation or any other payment; (ii) result in any
payment becoming due, accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or increase
the amount of compensation due to any such director, officer or Employee of
the Company or its Subsidiaries; (iii) result in any forgiveness of
indebtedness, trigger any funding obligation under any U.S. Company Plan or
impose any restrictions or limitations on the Company's rights to administer,
amend or terminate any U.S. Company Plan; or (iv) result in any payment
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) to any "disqualified
individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G‑1)
that could reasonably be expected, individually or in combination with any
other such payment, to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligation to provide any gross-up payment to any
individual with respect to any income Tax, additional Tax, excise Tax or
interest charge imposed pursuant to Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

(h) With respect to each U.S. Company Plan and Non-U.S. Company Plan, there
are no benefit obligations which are unfunded or for which contributions have
not been made, in either case to the extent required by such U.S. Company Plan
or Non-U.S. Company Plan or applicable Law or, to the extent required by GAAP,
properly accrued.

(i) Except for the IPC Media Pension Scheme or any other Non-U.S. Company Plan
which is established in the UK, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries participates in or contributes to, or has any actual or
contingent liability in relation to, any pension scheme or arrangement
established in the UK for the provision of Relevant Pension Benefits and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has given any undertaking or
made any proposal or announcement as to the continuation, introduction or
variation of any Relevant Pension Benefits. For these purposes, "Relevant
Pension Benefits" means any pension, lump sum, gratuity or other like benefit
provided or to be provided on death or in the event of incapacity or, in
connection with past service, before retirement or on or after death.

(j) Except for insured death in service lump sum benefits and except for the
IPC Media Pension Scheme, each benefit payable under any Non-U.S. Company Plan
which is



established in the UK is calculated solely by reference to assets which
(because of the nature of the calculation) must necessarily suffice for the
purposes of its provision to or in respect of the individual entitled to the
benefit. All contributions due for payment in relation to any Non-U.S. Company
Plan which is established in the UK have been paid by the relevant due date
and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is liable to reimburse any
Person in respect of such payment. All membership records (detailing the
contributions to and benefits payable) of any Non-U.S. Company Plan which is
established in the UK are up to date and accurate and complete in all material
respects.

(k) No contribution notice or financial support direction has been issued
(nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is threatened) under the Pensions Act
2004 by the UK Pensions Regulator in relation to any UK tax registered pension
arrangement (including the IPC Media Pension Scheme) to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is or has been a participating employer (or is or has
been connected or associated with such a participating employer) for the
purposes of the Pensions Act 2004. In respect of any Non-U.S. Company Plan
which is established in the UK (including the IPC Media Pension Scheme), no
report has been made to the UK Pensions Regulator under section 70 (duty to
report breaches of the law) of the Pensions Act 2004, nor is there any fact or
circumstance which is likely to give rise to such a report and each report
required under section 69 (duty to notify the Regulator of certain events) has
been made and the Company has made a copy of each such report available to
Parent.

(l) All contributions due for payment in relation to the IPC Media Pension
Scheme have been paid by the relevant due date and neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries is liable to reimburse any Person in respect of such
payment. To the Company's Knowledge, all membership records (detailing the
contributions to and benefits payable) of the IPC Media Pension Scheme are up
to date and accurate and complete in all material respects. The Company has
made available to Parent in relation to the IPC Media Pension Scheme the: (i)
last two formal tri-annual actuarial valuations and last two annual valuation
reports, (ii) current schedule of contributions and recovery plan, (iii)
current statement of funding principles and (iv) current statement of
investment principles. IPC Media Pension Trustee Limited, as the trustee of
Pension Scheme, has not accepted any contribution from a European employer (as
defined for the purposes of Part 7 (cross border activities within European
Union) of the Pensions Act 2004).

(m) The Company Disclosure Letter contains details of the Estimated Insurance
Buy-out Deficit (as defined in the Deed of Guarantee) for the IPC Media
Pension Scheme as at the date of the Company Disclosure Letter. As at the date
of this Agreement, no "Escrow Event" (as defined in the Deed of Guarantee) has
occurred since the Deed of Guarantee was executed on October 19, 2015. The
Heads of Terms Agreement (UK Pensions), dated as of November 25, 2017 (the
"Parent Heads of Terms"), among the Company, Parent, Time Inc. (UK) Ltd,
International Publishing Corporation Limited and IPC Media Pension Trustee
Limited (the "Trustee"), is valid and binding and in full force and effect
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, enforceable against the Trustee in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exceptions. No
further approval or action of the Trustee is required in order to substitute
Parent as the Guarantor under the Deed of Guarantee upon the consummation of
the Offer or to avoid the consummation of the Offer or the Merger causing an
Escrow Event, in each



case, so long as (w) all parties to the Parent Heads of Terms perform their
obligations in accordance with the terms thereunder, (x) the conditions to the
application of Clauses 4 to 6 of the Parent Heads of Terms are satisfied and
(y) Parent provides all documents required under Clause 5(2) of the Parent
Heads of Terms. The Deed of Guarantee has not been amended (other than agreed
changes in investment strategy as provided for in the defined term Agreed
Investment Strategy) since the Deed of Guarantee was executed on October 19,
2015.

(n) Neither IPC Media Pension Trustee Limited (as the trustee of IPC Media
Pension Scheme) or Time Inc. (UK) Ltd (as the sponsor of the IPC Media Pension
Scheme) has entered into a legally enforceable agreement the effect of which
is to reduce the amount of any debt due to the IPC Media Pension Scheme under
section 75 or section 75A of the Pensions Act 1995 Act which may be recovered
by, or on behalf of, IPC Media Pension Trustee Limited.

Section 4.19 Employees; Labor Matters.

(a) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by

Section 5.6 Financial Ability.

(a) Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions precedent to Parent's

of the Transaction Financing (defined below) that is required to be satisfied
by Parent as a condition to such Transaction Financing, or that the
Transaction Financing will not be made available to Parent on the Closing
Date. Assuming the Transaction Financing is funded in accordance with the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, the aggregate net proceeds
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter,
together with the cash of Parent and its Subsidiaries, will be an amount
sufficient for the satisfaction of Parent's cash payment obligations under
this Agreement on the Closing Date (including payment of the Offer
Consideration, the Merger Consideration, all indebtedness of the Company and
Parent expected to be required to be repaid or contemplated to be repaid as a
condition of the Transaction Financing (the "Retired Debt") and any fees and
expenses of, or payable by, Parent, Purchaser or the Company in connection
with the Offer or the Merger or the Transaction Financing).

(b) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, complete and correct copy of
(i) an executed commitment letter and fee letters (as redacted in a customary
manner to remove the fee



amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex" and
certain other terms (none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal
amount of the Transaction Debt Financing)) (collectively, the "Debt Commitment
Letter") from the financial institutions identified therein (together with
their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, employees,
directors, equityholders, partners, controlling parties, advisors, agents and
Representatives, any substitute, replacement or alternative financial
institution permitted by Section 8.11(a), and in each case their respective
successors and assigns, the "Debt Financing Sources"), pursuant to which, upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Debt Financing
Sources have committed to lend or invest the amounts set forth therein on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein for the purpose of
financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Transaction
Debt Financing"), and (ii) an executed commitment letter and fee letter (as
redacted in a customary manner to remove the fee amounts and certain other
terms (none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate amount of the
Transaction Financing to be made available thereunder) (collectively, the
"Equity Commitment Letter" and collectively with the Debt Commitment Letter,
the "Commitment Letters")) from Koch Equity Development LLC (together with
their respective Affiliates and their respective officers, employees,
directors, equityholders, partners, controlling parties, advisors, agents and
Representatives, any substitute, replacement or alternative financial
institution permitted by Section 8.11(a), and their respective successors and
assigns, the "Equity Financing Sources" and collectively with the Debt
Financing Sources, the "Financing Sources") pursuant to which, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth therein, the Equity Financing Sources
have committed to purchase securities issued by Parent in the amounts set
forth therein on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein for
the purpose of financing the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Transaction Equity Financing" and collectively with the Transaction Debt
Financing, the "Transaction Financing").

(c) Other than as expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Equity Commitment Letter, there are no other agreements, side letters,
arrangements or understandings, in each case associated with the Transaction
Financing, which would (i) impair the enforceability of the Debt Commitment
Letter or Equity Commitment Letter, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the
Transaction Financing or (iii) impose new or additional (or adversely expand,
modify or amend any of the existing) conditions precedent to the Transaction
Financing relating to the financing of the cash amounts needed to be paid in
connection with the Offer or the Merger (including all fees and expenses
required to be paid in connection with the Transaction Financing). There are
no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the
full amount of the Transaction Financing, except as set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to the
Company as of the date hereof.

(d) As of the date hereof, each of the Debt Commitment Letter and Equity
Commitment Letter in the form so delivered to the Company is in full force and
effect and represents the legally valid and binding obligation of Parent and
Parent's Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of
the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject
to the Enforceability Exceptions. As of the date hereof,



neither the Debt Commitment Letter nor the Equity Commitment Letter have been
withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended, restated, modified or
waived in any respect (other than amendments, modifications, substitutions or
replacements as permitted by Section 8.11). Parent and Parent's Subsidiaries
are not in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter. All fees required to be
paid under the Debt Commitment Letter and Equity Commitment Letter have been
paid in full or, if not yet due, will be duly paid in full when due.

(e) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of financing is not a
condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if any financing
contemplated to be obtained by Parent in connection with the Merger has not
been obtained prior to the Closing, Parent and Purchaser shall continue to be
obligated, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions to the Offer
set forth in Annex A and the conditions in Section 9.1 to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement at the
Closing in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 5.7 Litigation. Except as would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (a) there is no Proceeding pending
(or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened) by any Governmental Authority
against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the Knowledge of Parent,
against any present or former officer or director of Parent in such
individual's capacity as such, in each case, before any Governmental Authority
and (b) to the Knowledge of Parent, Parent and its Subsidiaries are not under
investigation by any Governmental Authority with respect to any violation by
Parent or its Subsidiaries of any applicable Law or Order.

Section 5.8 Share Ownership. None of Parent, Purchaser or any of their
respective "affiliates" or "associates" (as defined in Section 203 of the
DGCL) (a) beneficially owns (as such term is used in Rule 13d-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act) any Company Stock or any options, warrants or other
rights to acquire Company Stock or other securities of, or any other economic
interest (through derivatives, securities or otherwise) in the Company or (b)
is, or at any time within the past three years has been, an "interested
stockholder" of the Company (as defined in Section 203 of the DGCL).

Section 5.9 No Additional Representations. Except for the representations and
warranties expressly made by Parent and Purchaser in this Article V, neither
Parent, Purchaser nor any other Person makes, and the Company disclaims any
reliance upon, any express or implied representation or warranty whatsoever or
with respect to any information provided or made available in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any information,
documentation, forecasts, budgets, projections or estimates provided by Parent
or any Representative of Parent, including in any "data rooms" or management

ARTICLE VII

COVENANTS OF PARENT AND PURCHASER

Section 7.1 Obligations of Purchaser. Parent shall cause Purchaser to perform
when due its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and
the Merger pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and the Offer.



Section 7.2 Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent
shall indemnify and hold harmless each former and present director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, together with such person's
heirs, executors or administrators, a "Company Indemnified Party") against any
costs, expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance
of the final disposition of any actual or threatened claim to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
as provided in the applicable certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) or any indemnification agreement as in
effect on the date of this Agreement), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any
actual or threatened claim with respect to acts or omissions occurring or
alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, in connection with such
persons serving as an officer, director, Employee or other fiduciary of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or of any Person if such service was at the
request of or for the benefit of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, to
the fullest extent permitted by Law and as provided in their respective
certificates of incorporation, bylaws (or comparable organizational documents)
or any indemnification agreement as in effect on the date of this Agreement.
All rights to elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement of
expenses for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after
the Effective Time, in effect as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the
Company Indemnified Parties shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) honor all the
terms thereof for a period of not less than six years after the Effective
Time. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Company
Indemnified Party notifies Parent on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time of a matter in respect of which such Person may seek
indemnification pursuant to this Section 7.2, the provisions of this Section
7.2 shall continue in effect with respect to such matter until the final
disposition of all claims relating thereto.

(b) For a period of not less than six years after the Effective Time, Parent,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, shall cause to be
maintained in effect the provisions in the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws and comparable organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation
and each Subsidiary of the Company (or in such documents of any successor
thereto) regarding elimination of liability, indemnification and advancement
of expenses in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and,
during such six year period, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individual who immediately before the Effective Time was a
Company Indemnified Party, except as required by applicable Law.

(c) Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i)
continue to maintain in effect for a period of no less than six years after
the Effective Time the Company's directors' and officers' insurance policies
(the "DandO Insurance"), in place as of the date of this Agreement or (ii)
purchase comparable DandO Insurance (from a carrier with the same or better



credit rating as the Company's DandO Insurance carrier) for such six-year
period, in each case, with coverage for the persons who are covered by the
Company's existing DandO Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage at least as favorable to the insured individuals as the
Company's existing DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring
prior to the Effective Time; provided that in no event shall Parent or the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the amount per annum
the Company paid in its last full fiscal year (the "Premium Cap"); provided,
further, that if the amount necessary to procure such insurance coverage
exceeds the Premium Cap, the Company may purchase the most advantageous policy
available for an amount not to exceed the Premium Cap. At the Company's
option, the Company may purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a prepaid "tail
policy" for a period of no more than six years after the Effective Time with
coverage for the persons who are covered by the Company's existing DandO
Insurance, with terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage at least
as favorable to the insured individuals as the Company's existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective
Time, in which event Parent shall cease to have any obligations under the
first sentence of this Section 7.2(c); provided that the aggregate premium for
such policies shall not exceed the Premium Cap; provided, further, that if the
amount of annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Premium Cap, the Company may procure and maintain for
such six-year period the most advantageous policy available for an annual
premium equal to the Premium Cap. In the event the Company elects to purchase
such a "tail policy," the Surviving Corporation shall (and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to) maintain such "tail policy" in full force and
effect for a period of no less than six years after the Effective Time and
continue to honor its obligations thereunder.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, to succeed to or assume the
applicable obligations of such Party set forth in this Section 7.2.

(e) The provisions of this Section 7.2 shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each of the Company Indemnified Parties and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such person may have by Contract, at Law or otherwise.

Section 7.3 Employee Matters.

(a) Except as provided in this Section 7.3, for a period beginning on the
Closing Date and continuing thereafter until the end of calendar year 2018
(the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide, Employees as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue employment with Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation, at or following
the Closing (the



"Continuing Employees") with employee benefits (excluding compensation and
equity-based compensation) that are (i) with respect to employee benefits that
were elected for the Continuation Period during the Company's annual
enrollment period recently ended, the same as those in effect for such
Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) with respect
to employee benefits that were not elected for the Continuation Period during
the Company's annual enrollment period recently ended, comparable in the
aggregate to those in effect for such Continuing Employees immediately prior
to the Closing; provided that until the one year anniversary of the Closing
Date, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall keep in effect all severance
plans, practices and policies that are applicable to employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 7.3(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. During the Continuation Period, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide the
Continuing Employees coverage under the same Company Plans set forth in
Section 7.3(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter as were in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Except as set forth in Section 7.3(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the right
of Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to (i) terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time, (ii) change or modify the
terms or conditions of employment for any Continuing Employee to the extent
such change is not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section 7.3 or
(iii) change or modify any Company Plan or other employee benefit plan or
arrangement in accordance with its terms; provided that such change or
modification does not otherwise violate the requirements of this Section 7.3.

(b) In the event that, during the 12 month period following the Closing Date,
Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to offer (a "Reduced
Compensation Offer") any Continuing Employee employment terms having (x) a
rate of basic pay, (y) a target short-term incentive opportunity (including
sales or management incentives) and (z) a target long-term incentive
opportunity that, in the aggregate, is less than the rate of basic pay, target
short-term incentive opportunity and the target long-term incentive
opportunity in the aggregate that was made available to such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing (the "Pre-Closing Compensation"),
such Reduced Compensation Offer shall be provided to the Continuing Employee
in writing and such Continuing Employee shall have 7 days to consider whether
to (i) accept employment on the terms provided in the Reduced Compensation
Offer or (ii) reject the Reduced Compensation Offer and instead receive
severance benefits. If a Continuing Employee shall accept the Reduced
Compensation Offer, the rate of compensation described therein shall not take
effect earlier than 28 days following the date the Reduced Compensation Offer
is provided to the Continuing Employee (the "Reduced Compensation Effective
Date").

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, Parent shall
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay severance to (i) any
Continuing Employee who rejects a Reduced Compensation Offer and who
voluntarily terminates employment within 14 days following the rejection of
such Reduced Compensation Offer, (ii) any Continuing Employee (including any
Continuing Employee who accepts or rejects a Reduced Compensation Offer) who
is terminated by the Company without cause (as such term is defined in the
Company Severance Plan or such Continuing Employee's employment agreement)
within 12 months following the Closing Date or, if applicable, the Reduced
Compensation Effective Date and



(iii) any Continuing Employee who (x) is notified within the 12 month period
following the Closing that his or her worksite is being relocated more than
fifty (50) miles, (y) declines to relocate and (z) voluntarily terminates
employment or is terminated without cause (as such term is defined in the
Company Severance Plan or such Continuing Employee's employment agreement) due
to his or her decision not to relocate, in each such case, in accordance with
the severance plans, practices and policies that are applicable to Employees
as of the date hereof and set forth on Section 7.3(c) of the Company
Disclosure Letter and any individual severance entitlements in an employment
agreement, offer letter or severance letter set forth on Section 7.3(c) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, except that, with respect to any Continuing
Employee who has accepted a Reduced Compensation Offer, the amount of such
severance benefits shall be determined assuming that such Continuing Employee
was receiving, at termination, the Pre-Closing Compensation.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, prior to the
Closing Date, the pre-closing Compensation Committee of the Board (or other
appropriate Company representatives) shall determine fiscal year 2017 annual
bonuses under the Time Inc. 2017 Annual Incentive Plan, the Time Inc.
Advertising Sales Incentive Plan and any other annual incentive or short-term
incentive bonus plan of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect for
the 2017 fiscal year of the Company in accordance with their terms and make
bonus payments prior to the Closing Date.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.3, prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall establish, or shall cause its Subsidiaries to
establish, the Time Inc. 2018 Annual Incentive Plan (the "2018 AIP"), the Time
Inc. 2018 Advertising Sales Incentive Plan (the "2018 ASIP") and other annual
incentive and short-term incentive bonus plans for fiscal year 2018 based on
the budgetary goals established by the pre-Closing Company Board (the "FY 2018
Company Bonus Plans"). Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of any FY 2018
Company Bonus Plan to the contrary, (1) if a Continuing Employee participates
in the 2018 AIP and such Continuing Employee either (a) participates in an
annual incentive or short-term bonus plan sponsored or maintained by Parent
and its Affiliates (the "FY 2018 Parent Bonus Plans") following June 30, 2018
or (b) terminates employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries and is
entitled to receive severance, such Continuing Employee shall receive a Pro-
Rated Incentive; (2) if a Continuing Employee participates in the 2018 ASIP or
a sales incentive plan of the Company or its Subsidiaries and such Continuing
Employee either (a) participates in a FY 2018 Parent Bonus Plan or (b)
terminates employment with the Company and its Subsidiaries and is entitled to
receive severance, such Continuing Employee shall receive a bonus based on
actual performance through June 30, 2018 or the date of termination (whichever
is earlier); and (3) Parent shall pay, or shall cause Surviving Corporation to
pay, any bonus payment payable under clauses (1) and (2) above no later than
60 days after June 30, 2018. The Company shall obtain Parent's prior consent
to the terms and conditions of such 2018 bonus plans to the extent they
contain material changes from the Company's corresponding bonus plans for 2017
(except as modified by this Section 7.3(e)); provided that the changes
described in Section 7.3(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall not require
Parent's consent. An Employee's "Pro-Rated Incentive" shall mean the product
of (i) and (ii) below:



(i) if the Effective Time occurs (X) on or prior to March 31, 2018, the amount
calculated under the terms of the applicable FY 2018 Company Bonus Plan based
on assumed target performance with respect to both quantitative and
qualitative metrics and (Y) after March 31, 2018, the amount calculated under
the terms of the applicable FY 2018 Company Bonus Plan using (A) actual
results and prorated annual metrics for quantitative metrics (i.e., financials
against budget) through March 31, 2018, (B) assumed target performance and
prorated annual metrics with respect to quantitative metrics for the period
April 1, 2018 through June 30, 2018 and (C) assumed target performance on
qualitative metrics (e.g., 100% strategic rating) for the period through June
30, 2018 multiplied by

(ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the 2018
calendar year through and including the earlier to occur of June 30, 2018 and
the date of termination, and the denominator of which is 365.

(f) For all purposes under the employee benefit plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Parent and its respective Affiliates
(including for the purposes of determining the severance benefits payable to a
Continuing Employee under any severance plan, program or arrangement of Parent
or any of its Affiliates in such which such Continuing Employee participates
following expiration of the commitment to maintain the severance plans of the
Company and its Subsidiaries for 12 months following the Closing, as specified
in Section 7.3(a)) in which Continuing Employees may be eligible to
participate after the Closing (the "New Benefit Plans"), Parent shall credit
each Continuing Employee with the same amount of service as was credited by
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time under similar or
comparable Company Plans in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except (x) for purposes of benefit
accrual under defined benefit plans (y) vesting under any equity-related plan
(other than the Assumed Awards), and (z) to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits). In addition, and without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, (i) with respect to any New Benefit Plans in
which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the
Closing, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause each Continuing
Employee to be immediately eligible to participate in such New Benefit Plans,
without any waiting time, to the extent coverage under such New Benefit Plans
replaces coverage under a similar or comparable Company Plan in which such
Continuing Employee was eligible to participate immediately before such
commencement of participation and (ii) for purposes of each New Benefit Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause all
pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such
New Benefit Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents, to the extent any such exclusions or requirements were
waived or were inapplicable under any similar or comparable Company Plan in
which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Closing.
To the extent changes occur in the middle of a plan year, Parent shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of
the plan year of the Company Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employee's participation in the corresponding New Benefit Plan begins to be
taken into account under such New Benefit Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee



and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such
amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Benefit Plan.

(g) The terms of this Section 7.3 are included for the sole benefit of the
Parties and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Continuing
Employee or former Employee, any participant or beneficiary in any Company
Plan or any other Person or Governmental Authority (whether as a third party
beneficiary or otherwise) other than the Parties hereto. Except as expressly
set forth in this Section 7.3, nothing contained in this Agreement shall (i)
constitute or be deemed to constitute an amendment to any Company Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan, policy, program or arrangement, (ii)
obligate Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to (x) maintain any particular
benefit plan or arrangement or (y) retain the employment of any particular
Employee; or (iii) prevent the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any benefit plan or arrangement.

memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals to be submitted to any
Governmental Authority with respect to filings under the HSR Act or any other
Competition Law and (v) coordinate with the other in preparing and exchanging
such information and promptly provide the other (and its counsel) with copies
of all filings, presentations or submissions (and a summary of any oral
presentations) made by such Party with any Governmental Authority relating to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR Act or
any other Competition Law.

(d) Unless prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the applicable
Governmental Authority, each of the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent
reasonably practicable, not participate in or attend any meeting, or engage in
any substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of
the Offer or the Merger (including with respect to any of the actions referred
to in Section 8.1(a) but other than as contemplated by Section 2.4 and Section
2.5) without the other, (ii) to the extent reasonably practicable, give the
other reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation and (iii) in
the event one such Party is prohibited by applicable Law or Order or by the
applicable Governmental Authority from participating or attending any such
meeting or engaging in any such conversation, keep the non-participating Party
reasonably apprised with respect thereto.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 8.1, but subject
to this Section 8.1(e), Parent shall take any action to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, including (i) the
prompt use of its best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order that would
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (A) the defense through
litigation on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other
proceeding by any Person, including any Governmental Authority, seeking to
delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of such
transactions, (B) the proffer and agreement by Parent of its willingness to
sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such
disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease, license, disposal and
holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines, categories of assets
or businesses or other operations or interests therein of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries)
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Governmental Authority giving effect thereto) and (C) the proffer and
agreement by Parent of its willingness to take such other actions, and
promptly to effect such other actions (and the entry into agreements with, and
submission to orders of, the relevant Governmental Authority giving effect
thereto), in each case if such action should be reasonably necessary or
advisable to avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or
threatened (x) commencement of any Proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of
any Order that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any
Governmental Authority and (ii) the prompt use of its best efforts to take, in
the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary Order is entered or
issued, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any
proceeding or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with its terms
unlawful or that would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all
steps (including the appeal thereof and the posting of a bond) necessary to
resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such
actual, anticipated or threatened Order so as to permit such consummation on a
schedule as close as possible to that contemplated by this Agreement; provided
that Parent shall not be required to divest, license, hold separate, or take
any other action ("Remedy") with respect to any publication, brand, business,
or line of business of the Company, Parent or their respective Subsidiaries
that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
Nothing in this Section 8.1(e) shall obligate Parent to agree to any Remedy or
other remedy not conditioned on the consummation of the Offering and the
Closing.

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, directly or indirectly,
acquire or agree to acquire any other Person or assets (whether by merger,
consolidation, stock or asset purchase, tender or exchange offer,
recapitalization, reorganization or any other form of transaction) to the
extent such acquisition would reasonably be expected to materially impair or
delay the ability of Parent to obtain the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.



Section 8.2 No Solicitation; Board Recommendation.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article X, and except as otherwise specifically provided for in this
Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its officers, directors,
Employees and Representatives not to (including by directing them not to),
directly or indirectly, (i) continue any solicitation, knowing encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect
to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (iii)
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any
Person (other than Parent, its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives) any nonpublic information relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in connection with any inquiry, proposal or offer which
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, (iv) approve or recommend, or make any public statement approving or
recommending, any inquiry, proposal or offer which constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Acquisition Proposal, (v) enter
into any letter of intent, merger agreement or other similar agreement
regarding or providing for a Company Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or
offer which could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in
compliance with this Section 8.2) (each an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement"), (vi) submit any Company Acquisition Proposal to a vote of the
stockholders of the Company or (vii) resolve or agree to do any of the
foregoing. The Company agrees that in the event any Representative of the
Company takes any action which, if taken by the Company, would constitute a
breach of this Section 8.2, the Company shall be deemed in breach of this
Section 8.2.

(b) If, prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company receives an unsolicited bona
fide written Company Acquisition Proposal that was made after the date of this
Agreement and that the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, (i) is or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal
and (ii) failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then
the Company may, in response to such Company Acquisition Proposal, furnish
nonpublic information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Person or group (or any of their Representatives) making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and engage in discussions or negotiations with such
Person or group and their Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition
Proposal; provided that (x) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information
relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to such Person or group or their
respective Representatives, the Company gives written notice to Parent after
any such determination by the Company Board and enters into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with the Person or group making such Company
Acquisition Proposal (and the information is furnished pursuant to such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), and (y) the Company promptly (but not
more than 24 hours) after furnishing any such nonpublic information to such
Person, furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such
nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished to Parent or its
Representatives).



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries and the Company's Representatives may in any
event (A) seek to clarify the terms and conditions of any Company Acquisition
Proposal solely to determine whether such Company Acquisition Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and
(B) inform a Person or group that has made or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, is considering making, a Company Acquisition Proposal of the
provisions of this Section 8.2. In no event may the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives directly or indirectly reimburse
or pay, or agree to reimburse or pay, the fees, costs or expenses of, or
provide or agree to provide any compensation to, any Person or Persons (or any
of its or their Representatives or potential financing sources) who makes a
Company Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify
Parent after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal, any inquiry or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry or request for nonpublic information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries by any Person who has made or could reasonably be
expected to make a Company Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall indicate
the identity of the Person making such inquiry or proposal and include a copy
of the Company Acquisition Proposal or, if not in writing, a summary of the
material terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer or the nature of
the information requested pursuant to such inquiry or request. Thereafter, the
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a prompt basis (and in any
event within 24 hours), regarding any material developments, discussions or
negotiations regarding any such proposal or offer and any material changes to
the status and material terms of any such proposal or offer (including any
material amendments thereto or any material change to the scope or material
terms or conditions thereof).

(d) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, and shall
direct its Representatives to, immediately cease any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent and its Subsidiaries) with
respect to any potential Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall
promptly terminate access by any such Person or group to any such physical or
electronic data rooms relating to any potential Company Acquisition Proposal.
The Company shall promptly after the date hereof request each Person (if any)
that has received information from the Company during the past twelve months
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement relating to any potential Company
Acquisition Proposal to promptly return to the Company or destroy all non-
public documents and materials relating to the Company Acquisition Proposal or
to the Company or its Subsidiaries or its or their businesses, operations or
affairs heretofore furnished by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their Representatives to such Person or group or any of its Representatives in
accordance with the terms of such confidentiality agreement, and shall not
waive, terminate or modify without Parent's prior written consent, any
standstill or similar provision in any confidentiality, standstill or other
agreement with such Person; provided that the Company may waive any standstill
or similar provisions to the extent necessary to permit a Person or group to
make, on a confidential basis to the Company Board, a Company Acquisition
Proposal, conditioned upon such Person agreeing to disclosure of such Company
Acquisition Proposal to Parent.



(e) Subject to this Section 8.2, neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to Section 8.2(f),
prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company Board may effect a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (and, in the case of a bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited after the date of this Agreement and
that did not result from a material breach of this Section 8.2, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii) and concurrently pay the fees
required by Section 10.3 in order to enter into a definitive agreement in
connection with a Superior Proposal) if: (i) (A) a Company Acquisition
Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement and such
Company Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn prior to such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or (B) there has been an Intervening Event; (ii) in the
case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board concludes in good
faith, after consultation with the Company's outside financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal; and (iii) the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that failure to take
such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

(f) Prior to making any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or entering into
any Alternative Acquisition Agreement, (i) the Company Board shall provide
Parent at least four Business Days' prior written notice of its intention to
take such action, which notice shall specify, in reasonable detail, the
reasons therefor and, in the case of a Company Acquisition Proposal, the
material terms and conditions of such proposal, including a copy of any
proposed definitive agreements; (ii) during the four Business Days following
such written notice, the Company Board and its Representatives shall negotiate
in good faith with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby
proposed by Parent in response to such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event,
as applicable; and (iii) at the end of the four Business Day period described
in the foregoing clause (ii), the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel and outside financial
advisors (and taking into account any legally binding (if accepted by the
Company) adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent), that, as applicable (A) the Company Acquisition Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal or (B) the Intervening Event continues to
warrant a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and, in each case, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Laws. The provisions of
this Section 8.2(f) shall also apply to any material change to any Company
Acquisition Proposal or Intervening Event and require a new written notice,
except that the references to four Business Days shall be deemed to be two
Business Days.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company Board from
taking and disclosing to their stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated
by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange
Act; provided, however, that this Section 8.2(g) shall not permit the Company
Board to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent
otherwise permitted by this Section 8.2; provided,



further, that a request by Parent for the Company to publicly recommend
against a Company Acquisition Proposal may not be made more than once with
respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal unless such Company Acquisition
Proposal is subsequently materially amended or modified, in which case Parent
may make one request each time such Company Acquisition Proposal is so
subsequently materially amended or modified. For the avoidance of doubt, any
"stop, look and listen" communication or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act shall not constitute a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change so long as any such disclosure does not
include a Company Board Recommendation Change.

Section 8.3 Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Parent nor the Company, nor any of their respective Affiliates, shall
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public statement
relating to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement without the prior written
consent of the other Party, unless such Party determines, after consultation
with outside counsel, that it is required by applicable Law or by any listing
agreement with or the listing rules of a national securities exchange or
trading market to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to the Offer, the Merger or this Agreement,
in which event such Party shall provide, on a basis reasonable under the
circumstances, an opportunity to the other Party to review and comment on such
press release or other announcement in advance, and shall give reasonable
consideration to all reasonable comments suggested thereto. None of the
limitations set forth in this Section 8.3 shall apply to any disclosure of any
information (a) in connection with or following a Company Acquisition Proposal
or Company Adverse Recommendation Change and matters related thereto, (b) in
connection with any dispute between the Parties relating to this Agreement or
(c) consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance with this Section 8.3.

Section 8.4 Notices of Certain Events. Each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any material written
notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) any written notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority or securities exchange in
connection with the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (c) any Proceeding or investigation, commenced or, to its
Knowledge, threatened against, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, that would be
reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) result
in the failure of any condition to the Offer set forth in Annex A or the
Merger set forth in Section 9.1 to be satisfied, or (d) the occurrence of any
event which would or would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the
Offer set forth in Annex A or the Merger set forth in Section 9.1 to be
satisfied; provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
8.4 shall not (x) affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty,
covenant, right, remedy, or condition to any obligation of any Party hereunder
or (y) update any section of the Company Disclosure Letter.



Section 8.5 Access to Information.

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article X, upon reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable Law, each
Party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to any other Party,
its Affiliates and its officers, agents, control persons, employees,
consultants and professional advisers (including attorneys, accountants and
financial advisors) ("Representatives") reasonable access during normal
business hours, to all of its and its Subsidiaries' properties, books,
Contracts, commitments, records, officers and employees and, during such
period each Party shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish to the
other Party all other information concerning it, its Subsidiaries and each of
their respective businesses, properties and personnel as the requesting Party
may reasonably request; provided that the Party receiving such request may
restrict the foregoing access and the disclosure of information to the extent
that, in the good faith judgment of such Party, (i) any Law applicable to such
Party or its Subsidiaries requires such Party or its Subsidiaries to restrict
or prohibit access to any such properties or information, (ii) the information
is subject to confidentiality obligations to a Third Party (provided that the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain approval from such
Third Party to disclose such information to the extent practicable), (iii)
disclosure of any such information or document could result in the loss of
attorney-client privilege or (iv) such access would unreasonably disrupt the
operations of such Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 8.5(a), each
of Parent and the Company shall comply with, and shall cause such Party's
Representatives to comply with, all of its obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which agreement shall remain in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.

Section 8.6 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take all such steps as may be
required to cause any dispositions of Company Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Stock) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

Section 8.7 Rule 14d-10 Matters. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Company Board or its compensation committee) shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d)
promulgated under the Exchange Act any employment compensation, severance or
employee benefit arrangements that have been or will be entered into after the
date of this Agreement by the Company or its Subsidiaries with current or
future directors, officers or Employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries and
to ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of
such rule.

Section 8.8 Stock Exchange De-listing; Exchange Act Deregistration. Parent
shall, with the reasonable cooperation of the Company, take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, necessary, proper
or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the
NYSE to enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the



Company Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Company Stock and
other securities of the Company under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time.

Section 8.9 Stockholder Litigation. Each Party shall promptly notify the other
Party in writing of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement that is
brought against such Party, its Subsidiaries and/or any of their respective
directors and shall keep the other Party informed on a reasonably current
basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, at its expense and subject to a customary joint
defense agreement, in the defense or settlement of any such litigation, and
the Company shall not settle any such litigation without the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
Without limiting in any way the Parties' obligations under Section 8.1, each
of the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
to, cooperate in the defense or settlement of any litigation contemplated by
this Section 8.9.

Section 8.10 Takeover Statutes. The Parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover
Statute is or becomes applicable to the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated hereby and (b) if any such Takeover Statute is or
becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to take all action necessary so
that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby may
be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise to eliminate or minimize the effect of such
Takeover Statute on the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby. Unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated pursuant to
Article X, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall change, or be deemed
to change, the approval of the Company Board for purposes of causing any
Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 8.11 Financing.

(a)

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Transaction
Financing on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions and
taking into account the Marketing Period) described in the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter at the Acceptance Time (taking into
account the Marketing Period), and shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Company, permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or
any waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity
Commitment Letter, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) delay
or prevent or make less likely the funding of the Transaction Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter
(or satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the Transaction Financing) on
the Closing Date in any material respect or (y) extend or permit the extension
of the Marketing Period or Minimum Notes Marketing Period (in each case as
defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) (provided that, without the consent of
the Company, Parent may amend the Debt Commitment



Letter (A) to favorably modify pricing terms or add additional lenders,
arrangers, bookrunners and agents or (B) to implement or exercise any of the
"market flex" provisions (including pricing terms) contained in the fee letter
executed in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter). Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. For purposes of this Section 8.11, references to "Transaction
Financing" shall include the Transaction Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter as permitted to be amended,
modified or replaced by this Section 8.11(a) and references to "Debt
Commitment Letter" and/or "Equity Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this Section
8.11(a). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent and Purchaser shall have the right to substitute other debt or equity
financing for all or any portion of the Transaction Financing contemplated by
the Debt Commitment Letter and/or the Equity Commitment Letter from the same
and/or alternative Debt Financing Sources and/or Equity Financing Sources so
long as such substitute financing would not materially and adversely impact
the ability of Parent and Purchaser to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis.

(ii) Each of Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to
maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter
(except to the extent replaced in accordance with Section 8.11(a), (B) to
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter
and the Equity Commitment Letter consistent in all material respects with the
terms and conditions (including the flex provisions and taking into account
the Marketing Period) contained in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable (taken as a whole) to Parent
and Purchaser than the terms and conditions (including flex provisions) in the
Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter), (C) to satisfy (or
obtain the waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions precedent to funding in
the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter and such
definitive agreements thereto (taking into account the Marketing Period and
other than any condition where the failure to be so satisfied is a direct
result of the Company's failure to furnish information described in Section
8.11(b)) that are within Parent's control so as to consummate the Transaction
Financing at or prior to the Acceptance Time and (D) to enforce its rights
under the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter and such
definitive agreements thereto. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably
informed on a current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its
efforts to arrange the Transaction Financing and provide to the Company copies
of the material definitive agreements for the Transaction Financing. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall give the Company prompt
notice (x) of any material breach or default by any party to any of the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements
related to the Transaction Financing of which Parent becomes aware, (y) of the
receipt of (I) any written notice or (II) other written communication, in each
case from any Debt Financing Source or Equity Financing Source with respect to
any actual or potential material breach, default, termination or repudiation
by any party to any of the Debt Commitment Letter or the



Equity Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Transaction
Financing of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or the Equity
Commitment Letter or definitive agreements related to the Transaction
Financing, and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent believes in good faith
that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Transaction
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by any of the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment
Letter or definitive agreements related to the Transaction Financing. As soon
as reasonably practicable after any notice by Parent to the Company of the
type described in the immediately preceding sentence, but in any event within
two Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent a written
request, Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause (x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence; provided that
Parent need not provide any information the disclosure of which could result
in the loss of attorney-client privilege or that is requested for purposes of
litigation. If all or any portion of the Transaction Financing becomes
unavailable for any reason, and such portion is reasonably required to pay the
aggregate Offer Consideration and Merger Consideration, repay the Retired Debt
and pay all fees, expenses and other amounts contemplated to be paid by
Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation pursuant to this Agreement,
Parent, Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall use their reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof alternative debt
and/or equity Transaction Financing from alternative sources in an amount
sufficient, when taken together with available cash of Parent and any then-
available Transaction Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter and the
Equity Commitment Letter, to consummate the Offer and the Merger, with such
alternative Transaction Debt Financing or Transaction Equity Financing having
terms and conditions not materially less favorable (taken as a whole) to
Parent and Purchaser than the terms and conditions (taken as a whole) set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event.
Parent shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all commitment
letters and fee letters (as redacted in a customary manner to remove the fee
amounts, pricing caps, the rates and amounts included in the "market flex" and
certain other terms (none of which could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the conditionality, enforceability, termination or aggregate principal
amount of the Transaction Financing)) pursuant to which any such alternative
source shall have committed to provide any portion of the Transaction
Financing. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 8.11 or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall the "reasonable best efforts" of
Parent and Purchaser be deemed or construed to require any such Person to, and
no such Person shall be required to, pay any financing fees in the aggregate
in excess of those contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter and the Equity
Commitment Letter, or agree to conditionality or economic terms of the
financing that are (other than as specified in the preceding sentence)
materially less favorable than those contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter and the Equity Commitment Letter or any related fee letter (including
any "flex" provision therein).



(b) With respect to the Transaction Financing, prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and the Company's Subsidiaries' respective
Representatives to provide to Parent such cooperation in connection with the
Transaction Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including:

(i) assisting in preparation for and participation, upon reasonable advance
notice, in a reasonable number of meetings and calls (including customary one-
on-one meetings with parties acting as lead arrangers, bookrunners or agents
for, and prospective lenders of, the Transaction Financing), drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions
(including accounting due diligence sessions), in each case taking into
account the affected personnel's other professional obligations, and assisting
Parent in obtaining ratings in respect of Parent and public ratings in respect
of any debt issued as part of the Transaction Financing from Standard and Poor's
Financial Services LLC and Moody's Investors Service, Inc.;

(ii) assisting Parent and its potential financing sources in the preparation
of (A) customary offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar marketing documents for any of
the Transaction Financing (including the provision of "backup" support),
including the execution and delivery of customary representation or
authorization letters in connection with bank information memoranda
authorizing the distribution of information to prospective lenders and
identifying any portion of such information that constitutes material,
nonpublic information regarding the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries or
their respective securities (in each case in accordance with customary
syndication practices) and containing a representation that the public-side
version does not include material non-public information about the Company and
its Subsidiaries or their securities and (B) customary materials for rating
agency presentations for the Transaction Financing;

(iii) delivering to Parent the Required Financial Information;

(iv) delivering to Parent and their potential financing sources as promptly as
reasonably practicable (x) such information as may be reasonably necessary for
the Required Financial Information to remain Compliant and (y) such other
pertinent financial and other customary information (including assistance with
preparing projections, financial estimates, forecasts and other forward-
looking information) to the extent reasonably requested by Parent in
connection with the preparation of the offering or information documents to be
used for the Transaction Financing and identified in paragraphs 10 and 11 of
Exhibit D to the Debt Commitment Letter, as applicable, and assisting Parent
in preparing pro forma (A) balance sheets and related notes as of the most
recently completed interim period, and (B) income statements and related notes
for the most recently completed fiscal year, for the most recently completed
interim period and for the most recently completed twelve month period for the
end of such most recently completed interim period, in each case prepared
after giving effect to the transactions described in the Debt Commitment
Letter as if such transactions had



occurred as of such date (in the case of such balance sheet) or at the
beginning of such period (in the case of such statements of income) and any
other pro forma financial information required by Regulation S-X in connection
with the Transaction Financing; provided that none of the Company, any of the
Company's Subsidiaries or any of their Representatives shall be responsible in
any manner for information relating to the proposed debt and equity
capitalization that is required for such pro forma financial information;

(v) using commercially reasonable efforts to cause its independent registered
public accounting firm for the Transaction Financing, to cooperate with Parent
in connection with the Transaction Financing, including, but solely for the
Transaction Financing, by (x) assisting with the due diligence activities of
Parent and the Financing Sources and (y) providing customary "comfort letters"
(including customary "negative assurances") and to provide customary consents
to the inclusion of audit reports in any relevant offering documents and
marketing materials;

(vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Transaction
Financing benefits from the existing lending relationships of the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries;

(vii) assisting to identify the steps for repayment on the Closing Date of the
Credit Facility, Company Bonds and other Retired Debt of the Company or the
Company's Subsidiaries other than indebtedness which may be mutually agreed
and cooperating with any back-stop, "roll-over" or termination of any existing
letters of credit thereunder (and the release and discharge of all related
Liens and security interests), by providing to Parent at least three (3)
Business Days prior to Closing customary pay-off letters (in substantially
final form, taking into account any final interest calculations the lenders
might need to conduct to finalize closer to the Closing);

(viii) subject to customary SunGard provisions with respect to limited
conditionality and certain funds set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter,
deliver possessory collateral contemplated thereby on the Closing Date;

(ix) at least three (3) Business Days prior to the expected Closing Date,
provide all documentation and other information relating to the Company and
the Company's Subsidiaries that the Financing Sources reasonably determine is
required by applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules
and regulations including the USA PATRIOT Act to the extent reasonably
requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the expected
Closing Date; and

(x) reasonable participation by senior financial officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries in the negotiation of the definitive documentation for the
Transaction Financing.

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and the Company's
Subsidiaries' logos in connection with the Transaction Financing; provided
that such logos are



used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to harm
or disparage the Company or the Company's Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of the Company's Subsidiary; and subject to the
prior review by, and consent of, the Company (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding any other
provision set forth herein or in any other agreement between Parent and the
Company (or their respective Affiliates), the Company agrees that Parent and
its Affiliates may share customary projections with respect to the Company and
its business, which are approved for distribution by the Company, with their
potential financing sources and other prospective lenders in connection with
any marketing efforts in connection with the Transaction Financing; provided
that the recipients of such information agree to customary confidentiality
arrangements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none
of the Company, any of the Company's Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective directors or officers or other personnel shall be required by this
Section 8.11 to take any action or provide any assistance that unreasonably
interferes in any material respect with the ongoing operations of the Company
and the Company's Subsidiaries, or would cause a breach or violation of any
Law, Contract or permit, or to execute or deliver any certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing Date or agree
to any change or modification of any existing certificate, document,
instrument or agreement that is effective prior to the Closing Date (other
than any customary payoff letters required to be received in connection with
the Transaction Financing).

(d) The Company shall, not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60)
days prior to the expected Closing Date and otherwise in accordance with the
terms of the Company Bonds, execute and deliver to the trustee with respect to
the Company Bonds the requisite redemption notices to redeem all of such
Company Bonds at, and contingent upon consummation of, the Offer and the
Merger. The Company shall prepare such redemption notices and other documents
in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent. "Company Bonds" shall mean,
collectively, (i) the Company's 5.75% Senior Notes and (ii) the Company's
7.50% Senior Notes.

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, none of the
Company or the Company's Subsidiaries shall be required to (i) pay any
commitment or other similar fee, including under any guarantee or pledge or
any other document relating to or in connection with the Transaction Financing
prior to the Closing Date, or (ii) enter into any binding agreement or
commitment or any resolution or otherwise take any corporate or similar action
in connection with the Transaction Financing that is not conditioned on the
occurrence of the Acceptance Time.

(f) Parent shall (i) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the Company's
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") from and against any and all out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties,
damages, interest, awards, liabilities or obligations directly or indirectly
suffered or incurred by the Indemnitees in connection with their cooperation
and assistance obligations set forth in this Section 8.11, except and only to
the extent such costs, expenses, judgments, fines, claims, losses, penalties,
damages, interest, awards, liabilities or obligations are finally determined
in a judicial proceeding (and not subject to further appeal) to have resulted
from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Company, any
of



the Company's Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives, (ii)
reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Company and the
Company's Subsidiaries (and its and their respective Representatives) in
connection with their cooperation and assistance obligations set forth in this
Section 8.11, and (iii) to the extent the Closing does not occur, reimburse
the Company for all fees and out-of-pocket expenses of the Company's
independent registered accounting firm or its other Representatives incurred
in connection with the Company's and its Subsidiaries cooperation and
assistance obligations set forth in this Section 8.11.

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION

Section 10.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Acceptance Time (except as otherwise stated below):

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

(b) by either the Company or Parent:

(i) if the Acceptance Time shall not have occurred on or before May 26, 2018
(the "End Date"); provided that if on the End Date the conditions to the Offer
set forth in clause (b) of Annex A shall not have been satisfied but all other
conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A shall have been satisfied or
waived in accordance with Section 2.1(b) (or are capable of being satisfied in
the case of conditions that by their nature are to be



satisfied on the Closing Date), then the End Date shall be extended, if the
Company notifies Parent, or Parent notifies the Company, in writing on or
prior to the End Date, to August 26, 2018; provided, further, that the right
to terminate this Agreement under this Section 10.1(b)(i) shall not be
available to a Party if the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur before the
End Date was primarily due to such Party's breach of any of its obligations
under this Agreement; or

(ii) if there shall have been issued an Order by a Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction permanently prohibiting the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger and such Order shall have become final and non-appealable;
provided that the Party seeking to terminate this Agreement under this Section
10.1(b)(ii) shall have used its reasonable best efforts to have such Order
lifted;

(c) by Parent:

(i) if a Triggering Event shall have occurred or if the Company or any of its
Representatives shall have Willfully Breached any of its obligations under
Section 8.2; or

(ii) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its (A)
representations or warranties or (B) covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise
to the failure of a condition to the Offer set forth in clauses (d)(i) through
(d)(v) of Annex A and (y) is incapable of being cured by the Company during
the 30-day period after written notice from Parent of such breach or failure
to perform, or, if capable of being cured during such 30-day period, shall not
have been cured by the earlier of the end of such 30-day period and the End
Date; provided that if such breach or failure to perform is capable of being
cured by the Company and the Company ceases using reasonable best efforts to
cure such breach or failure to perform following written notice from Parent,
Parent shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 10.1(c)(ii); provided, further, that Parent shall not have the right
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c)(ii) if Parent or
Purchaser is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements such that the Company has the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(i);

(d) by the Company:

(i) if Parent or Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
(A) representations or warranties or (B) covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement, in each case which breach or failure to perform (x) prevents
or would reasonably be expected to prevent Parent or Purchaser from
consummating the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) is incapable of
being cured by Parent and Purchaser during the 30-day period after written
notice from the Company of such breach or failure to perform, or, if capable
of being cured during such 30-day period, shall not have been cured by the
earlier of the end of such 30-day period and the End Date; provided that if
such breach or failure to perform is capable of being cured by Parent and
Purchaser and Parent or Purchaser cease using reasonable best efforts to cure
such breach



or failure to perform following written notice from the Company, the Company
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
10.1(d)(i); provided, further, that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(d)(i) if the Company is
then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements such that Parent has the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 10.1(c)(ii);

(ii) if (A) the Company Board authorizes the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal to the
extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions of, Section 8.2,
(B) substantially concurrent with the termination of this Agreement, the
Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement providing for a
Superior Proposal and (C) prior to or concurrently with such termination, the
Company pays to Parent in immediately available funds any fees required to be
paid pursuant to Section 10.3; or

(iii) all of the conditions set forth in Article IX have been satisfied
(except for any conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied on the
Closing Date, which are capable of being satisfied) and Parent and Purchaser
fail to consummate the Merger within three Business Days following the date
the Closing should have occurred (as such date may be extended in accordance
with this Agreement); or

(iv) the conditions to the Offer set forth in Annex A have been satisfied or
waived as of the expiration of the Offer (except for any conditions that by
their nature can only be satisfied as of such time, which are capable of being
satisfied) and Parent and Purchaser fail to consummate the Offer within three
Business Days following the date the Offer should have been consummated in
accordance with Section 2.3 (as such date may be extended in accordance with
this Agreement).

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 10.1, written
notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other
Party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in compliance with
Section 10.1, this Agreement shall be terminated and this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no effect, without any liability or obligation
on the part of any Party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or Representative of such Party), other than the
Confidentiality Agreement and other than this Section 10.2, Section 10.3 and
Article XI, which provisions shall survive such termination; provided,
however, that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.12, nothing
in this Section 10.2 shall relieve any Party from liability for Willful Breach
of this Agreement prior to such termination or the requirement to make the
payments set forth in Section 10.3. No termination of this Agreement shall
affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 10.3 Termination Fees; Expenses.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 10.1(c)(i) or in the event that this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to



Section 10.1(d)(ii), then, in each case, the Company shall pay to Parent, by
wire transfer of immediately available funds, a fee in the amount of
$65,000,000 (the "Company Termination Fee") at or prior to the termination of
this Agreement in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 10.1(d)(ii) or
as promptly as practicable (and, in any event, within two Business Days
following such termination) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section
10.1(c)(i).

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent
pursuant to Section 10.1(b)(i), or in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 10.1(c)(ii), and in each case at any
time after the date of this Agreement prior to such termination (i) a Company
Acquisition Proposal has been made to the Company and publicly announced and
has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement and (ii)
within twelve months after such termination, the Company (A) enters into an
agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal and a Company
Acquisition Proposal is subsequently consummated or (B) consummates a Company
Acquisition Proposal, then, in any such event, the Company shall pay to
Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the Company
Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation of the transaction arising
from a Company Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that for purposes of
the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" in this Section 10.3(b),
references to "15%" shall be replaced by "50%".

(c) The Parties acknowledge that (i) the agreements contained in this Section
10.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(ii) the Company Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
(iii) that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to timely pay any amount due
pursuant to this Section 10.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for any amount
due pursuant to this Section 10.3, then the Company shall pay Parent its
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amount due pursuant to this Section 10.3 from
the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the
annual rate of five percent plus the prime lending rate as published in The
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
(or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by applicable Law). All
payments under this Section 10.3 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated in writing by Parent. In no event
shall a Company Termination Fee be payable more than once.

(d) Other than in the case of Willful Breach by the Company, subject to
Section 11.12, in the event that this Agreement is terminated under
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to this
Section 10.3, the payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser against the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future
stockholders, directors, officers, Employees, Affiliates or Representatives
(the "Company Related Parties") for all losses and damages suffered as a
result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this



Agreement to be consummated or for a breach or failure to perform hereunder or
otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the Company Related
Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.



ARTICLE XI

Miscellaneous

Section 11.1 No Survival of Representations and Warranties. None of the
representations, warranties covenants and agreements in this Agreement, or in
any schedule, certificate, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to
this Agreement, shall survive the Effective Time or, except as provided in
Section 10.2, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1, as
the case may be. This Section 11.1 shall not limit any covenant or agreement
of the Parties which by its terms contemplates performance after the Effective
Time.

Section 11.2 Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects by
written agreement of the Parties at any time prior to the Acceptance Time with
respect to any of the terms contained herein; provided, however, that Section
8.11 (Financing); this Section 11.2 (Amendment and Modification); Section 11.8
(Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries); Section 11.11 (Governing
Law); Sections 11.12(a) and (c) (Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction); Section
11.13 (Waiver of Jury Trial) and Section 11.14 (Financing Sources) (and any
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, waiver
or termination of such provision would modify the substance of any such
Section) shall not be amended in a manner that is adverse to any Debt
Financing Source without the prior written consent of each Debt Financing
Source signatory to the Debt Commitment Letter or that is adverse to any
Equity Financing Source signatory to the Equity Commitment Letter without the
prior written consent of such Equity Financing Source.

Section 11.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
subject to applicable Law, Parent or Purchaser on the one hand, or the Company
on the other hand, may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement of the other Parties or (c)
waive compliance by the other Parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights, nor shall any single or partial exercise by any Party of any
of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of
such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge
and agree that Parent shall act on behalf of Purchaser and the Company may
rely on any notice given by Parent on behalf of Purchaser with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 11.3.



Section 11.4 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the Party
incurring such cost or expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall
pay any and all fees and expenses, other than the Company's attorneys' fees,
incurred in connection with the filing by the Parties of the premerger
notification and report forms relating to the Offer and the Merger under the
HSR Act and the filing of any notice of other document under any applicable
foreign Competition Law.

Section 11.5 Company Disclosure Letter References. All capitalized terms not
defined in the Company Disclosure Letter shall have the meanings assigned to
them in this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Letter shall, for all purposes
in this Agreement, be arranged in numbered and lettered parts and subparts
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections and subsections contained
in this Agreement. Each item disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall
constitute an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure for the purposes of,
the representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable) to which it
makes express reference and shall also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth
for the purposes of every other part in the Company Disclosure Letter relating
to the Company's representations and warranties (or covenants, as applicable)
set forth in this Agreement to the extent a cross-reference within the Company
Disclosure Letter is expressly made to such other part in the Company
Disclosure Letter, as well as to the extent that the relevance of such item as
an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure for purposes of, such other
section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the face of such
disclosure. The listing of any matter on the Company Disclosure Letter shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Company, or to otherwise
imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be disclosed by the
Company under this Agreement or falls within relevant minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No disclosure in the
Company Disclosure Letter relating to any possible breach or violation by the
Company of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an admission or
indication that any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred.
In no event shall the listing of any matter in the Company Disclosure Letter
be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the Company's representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, it
being understood that each Party need not sign the same counterpart. This
Agreement shall become effective when each Party shall have received a

electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be original signatures.

Section 11.8 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred
to herein), the Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement
(a) constitute the entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, between Parent and the Company and
among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof
(provided that (x) any provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement conflicting
with this Agreement shall be superseded by this Agreement and (y) all
standstill or similar provisions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate and no longer be in effect upon execution and delivery hereof)
and (b) are not intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations
or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except for the rights of the Company to
pursue, on behalf of the holders of Company Stock, damages (including damages
incurred or suffered by the holders of Company Stock in the event such holders
of Company Stock would not receive the benefit of the bargain negotiated by



the Company on their behalf as set forth in this Agreement) in the event of
Parent's or Purchaser's breach of this Agreement, and the rights of the
holders of Company Stock to (i) following the Acceptance Time, receive the
Offer Consideration in accordance with Article II and (ii) following the
Effective Time, receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article
III; provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, following the Effective
Time, the provisions of Section 7.2 shall be enforceable by each Company
Indemnified Party hereunder and his or her heirs and his or her
representatives. The Financing Sources shall be a third party beneficiary of
Section 8.11 (Financing); Section 11.2 (Amendment and Modification); this
Section 11.8 (Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries); Section 11.11
(Governing Law); Sections 11.12(a) and (c) (Enforcement; Exclusive
Jurisdiction); Section 11.13 (Waiver of Jury Trial); and Section 11.14
(Financing Sources).

Section 11.9 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as
a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 11.10 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties in
whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment without such
consent shall be null and void, provided, however, the Parent and the
Purchaser may assign this agreement without the prior written consent of the
other Parties to any of the Debt Financing Sources for purposes of creating a
security interest herein or otherwise assigning collateral in respect of the
Transaction Debt Financing, provided, further, however, that no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Purchaser of their respective obligations
under this Agreement. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

Section 11.11 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other state. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, each Party to this Agreement acknowledges and irrevocably agrees
that any action or proceeding, whether in contract or tort, at law or in
equity or otherwise, against any Financing Source arising out of, or relating
to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Transaction
Financing) and the performance thereof shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York.

Section 11.12 Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction.

(a) The rights and remedies of the Parties shall be cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur



and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that, subject to the limitations in Section 10.3(d), the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations to consummate the
Offer and the Merger, in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if
under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the
federal courts, any federal court located in the State of Delaware without
proof of actual damages or otherwise (and each Party hereby waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. The Parties' rights in this Section 11.12 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated hereby and each Party hereby waives any
objections to any remedy referred to in this Section 11.12.

(b) In addition, each of the Parties (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby
submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or,
if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of
the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue
in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if
neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of the
State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, and (iv) consents to
service of process being made through the notice procedures set forth in
Section 11.6.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party to this
Agreement acknowledges and irrevocably agrees that any action or proceeding,
whether in contract or tort, at law or in equity or otherwise, against any
Financing Source arising out of, or relating to, the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (including the Transaction Financing) shall be subject to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the State of New York,
County of New York, or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York in the Borough of Manhattan (and the appellate
courts thereof) and each party to this Agreement submits for itself and its
property with respect to any such action or proceeding to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court and agrees not to bring any such action or
proceeding in any other court.

Law, neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to accept for payment or,
subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC (including Rule

Purchaser to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Stock promptly after
termination or withdrawal of the Offer)), pay for any shares of Company Stock
that are validly tendered (and not validly withdrawn) in the Offer prior to
the expiration of the Offer in the event that, at the expiration of the Offer:

(a) the Minimum Condition shall not have been satisfied;

(b) any waiting period (and extension thereof) under the HSR Act relating to
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement shall not have expired or been
terminated;

(c) a Law or Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) shall have
been promulgated, entered, enforced, enacted or issued or be applicable to the
Offer or the Merger by any Governmental Authority that prohibits or makes
illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

(d) any of the following shall have occurred and continue to exist as of
immediately prior to the expiration of the Offer:

(i) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections
4.5(a) and 4.5(b) shall not be true and correct (except for de minimis
inaccuracies) at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as of the
Acceptance Time as if made at and as of the Acceptance Time (except to the
extent any such representation or warranty expressly relates to an earlier
date or period, in which case as of such date or period);

(ii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Section
4.10(a) shall not be true and correct at and as of the date of this Agreement;

(iii) the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Sections
4.2 and 4.24 shall not be true and correct in all material respects at and as

(iv) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Agreement (other than those set forth in Sections 4.5(a), 4.5(b), 4.10(a), 4.2
and 4.24 shall not be true and correct in all respects (disregarding all
materiality and "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifiers contained
therein), in each case at and as of the date of this Agreement and at and as
of the Acceptance Time as if made at and as of the Acceptance Time (except
representations and warranties that by their terms speak specifically as of
another specified time, in which case as of such time), except where the
failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

covenants and obligations under the Agreement required to be performed by it
at or prior to the expiration of the Offer;

(vi) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms;

officer of the Company certifying on behalf of the Company, and not in such
officer's personal capacity, that none of the conditions set forth in clauses
(d)(i), (d)(ii), (d)(iii), (d)(iv) or (d)(v) of this Annex A have occurred; or

(f) since the date of this Agreement, there has occurred any Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Except as expressly set forth in the Agreement, the foregoing conditions may
be asserted by Parent or Purchaser regardless of the circumstances giving rise
to any such conditions, and may be waived by Parent or Purchaser in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in their sole and absolute
discretion, in each case, subject to Section 2.1(b) of the Agreement and the
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC. The failure by Parent or
Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right and each such right shall be deemed an
ongoing right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
