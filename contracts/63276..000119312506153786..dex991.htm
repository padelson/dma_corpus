Agreement_ "); and

WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Amalgamation Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with
this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,

agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

The Amalgamation; Closing; Effective Time

1.1. _The Amalgamation._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

Company shall amalgamate (the " _Amalgamation_ ") with the resulting company
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Amalgamated Company_ ")
continuing to exist as a company incorporated and governed by the laws of
Bermuda. The Amalgamation shall have the effects specified under Section 109
of the Bermuda Companies Act 1981 (the " _Bermuda Act_ "). Prior to the
Effective Time, the parties shall enter into the Agreement of Amalgamation, in
the form attached hereto as _Annex B_ , and undertake all such other matters,
and do all such other things as may be necessary to effect the
Amalgamation under Bermuda law.

1.2. _Effective Time._ On the first business day (the " _Application Date_ ")
on which the last to be fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in
Article VII (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied on the Application Date, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of
those conditions) shall be satisfied or waived in accordance with this
Agreement and/or Laws, the Company and Parent will cause an application for
registration of an amalgamated company, along with all required documentation,
to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda (the " _Bermuda
Registrar_ ") as provided in Section 108 of the Bermuda Act, unless another
date or time is agreed to in writing by Parent and Company. The Amalgamation
shall become effective at the time set forth in the certificate
of amalgamation issued by the Bermuda Registrar in connection with the
application for registration (the " _Effective Time_ "). 1.3. _Closing._ The closing of the Amalgamation shall take place at the
offices of Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, 1888 Century Park East, Los Angeles,
California at 9:00 A.M., or at such other time and place as the Company and
Parent may agree in writing, on the business day on which the certificate of
amalgamation with respect to the Amalgamation is issued by the Bermuda
Registrar.

ARTICLE II

Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws of the Amalgamated Company

2.1.  _Memorandum of Association._ The memorandum of association of
Amalgamation Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the
form attached hereto as _Annex C-1_ ) shall be the memorandum of association
of the Amalgamated Company after the Effective Time (the " _Memorandum of
Association_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Bermuda law.

2.2. _The Bye-Laws._ The bye-laws of Amalgamation Sub as in effect at the
Effective Time (in the form attached hereto as _Annex C-2_ ) shall be the bye-
laws of the Amalgamated Company after the Effective Time (the " _Bye-Laws_
"), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Bermuda law.

ARTICLE III 

Officers and Directors of the Amalgamated Company

3.1. _Directors._ The directors of Amalgamation Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Amalgamated
Company until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Memorandum of Association and the Bye-Laws.

3.2. _Officers._ The officers of the Amalgamation Sub at the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Amalgamated
Company until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the Memorandum of Association and the Bye-Laws.

ARTICLE IV 

Effect of the Amalgamation on Capital Stock and Options; Exchange of
Certificates

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Amalgamation and without any action on the part of the holder of any of the
shares of the Company:

(a) _Amalgamation Consideration_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " and, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Shares owned by Parent, Amalgamation Sub or any other direct or
indirect subsidiary of Parent or Shares that are owned by any direct or
indirect subsidiary of the Company (each, an " _Excluded Share_ " and
collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ")) shall be converted into the right to
receive, subject to any required withholding of taxes and without interest,
an amount in cash equal to $11.55, subject to appropriate adjustment for any
dividend of Shares, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange with respect to the Shares occurring after the date
hereof and before the Effective Time (the " _Amalgamation Consideration_ ").
At the Effective Time, all Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a "
_Certificate_ ") formerly representing any Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Amalgamation
Consideration for each Share formerly represented thereby. 



 

2 (b) _Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall be cancelled by virtue of the
Amalgamation without payment of any consideration.

(c) _Amalgamation Sub_. Each share of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Amalgamation Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Amalgamated Company.

4.2. _Payment for Shares_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. As of the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with the
Companys prior approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
(the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares), amounts sufficient in the aggregate to provide
all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments pursuant to Section
4.1(a) (the " _Payment Fund_ ").

(b) _Payment Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event
later than the fifth business day following the Effective Time,
the Amalgamated Company shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares (other than holders of Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of
transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, such letter of
transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and
the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates. Upon surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor payment in the amount of the Amalgamation Consideration for
each Share formerly represented thereby (after giving effect to any required
tax withholdings) to which such holder is entitled, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the share register
of the Company, the Amalgamation Consideration to be paid upon due surrender
of the Certificate therefor may be paid to such a transferee if the
Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent, accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid. If any payment is to be made to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such exchange
shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent or the Paying Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.

(c)  _Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the share register of the Company
shall be closed and thereafter, there shall be no transfers on the share
register of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time. 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the
shareholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore
complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment
of cash upon due surrender of their Certificates (or affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of Parent, the Amalgamated Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person
shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any amount properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Laws.

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and delivery by such Person of an indemnity in favor of the Company
in respect thereof, the Paying  



 

3  Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
and such an indemnity, the amount to which such Person is entitled upon
due surrender of and deliverable in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate pursuant to this Agreement.

(f)  _Withholding_. Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Company shareholder such amounts as Parent and the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any other
applicable Tax Law with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Paying Agent, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Company shareholders in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent or the Paying Agent.

4.3. _Stock Options. _At the Effective Time, each then outstanding option
granted under the Companys 1994 Stock Option Plan, as amended and restated
(the " _1994 Stock Plan_ ") and under the Companys 2004 Omnibus Equity
Incentive Plan (the " _2004 Stock Plan_ ", together with the 1994 Stock Plan,
the " _Stock Plans_ "), to purchase Shares (a " _Company Option_ "), whether
vested or unvested, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive
from Parent an amount of cash equal to the product of (x) the amount, if any,
by which the Amalgamation Consideration exceeds the exercise price per Share
subject to such Company Option (whether vested or unvested) and (y) the
number of Shares issuable pursuant to the unexercised and outstanding portion
of such Company Option, less any required withholding of taxes. Each of Parent
and the Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take any necessary action
in connection with the foregoing sentence. Any amounts to be paid by Parent
pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be in addition to any amounts to be paid by
or on behalf of Parent pursuant to Section 4.2.

4.4. _Dissenting Shareholders._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, any Shares that are held by shareholders of the Company who did
not vote in favor of the Amalgamation shall be cancelled at the Effective Time
and converted into the right to receive the Amalgamation Consideration for
each Share formerly represented thereby, subject to the rights of shareholders
of the Company (" _Dissenting Shareholders_ ") who are not satisfied that the
Amalgamation Consideration constitutes fair value of their Shares and require
appraisal of the fair value of their Shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") under
Section 106 of the Bermuda Act. In the event that the Company decides to
proceed with the Amalgamation pending the determination of any appraisal
proceedings initiated by Dissenting Shareholders, the Dissenting Shareholders
shall receive the Amalgamation Consideration for each Share formerly
represented thereby upon compliance with the requirements set forth in Section
4.2. The Company shall give Parent (i) reasonably prompt notice of any written
demands by Dissenting Shareholders for appraisal of Dissenting Shares or
withdrawals of such demands received by the Company pursuant to the Bermuda
Act and (ii) the opportunity to participate to the extent permitted by
applicable Bermuda law in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands by Dissenting Shareholders for appraisal of Dissenting Shares under
the Bermuda Act. Except as required by Section 106 of the Bermuda Act, prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to
any demands by Dissenting Shareholders of Dissenting Shares or offer to settle
or settle any such demands.

4.5. _Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Amalgamated Company with full right, title and possession to
all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the
Company, the officers and directors of the Amalgamated Company are hereby
fully authorized in the name of the Company or otherwise to take, and will use
all good faith efforts to take, all such lawful and necessary action in
connection therewith, so long as such action is not inconsistent with this
Agreement.



 

4 ARTICLE V

Representations and Warranties

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company._ Except as set forth in
the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company on or prior to
entering into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
agreed that disclosure of any item in any part of the Company
Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other part
to which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company
hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Amalgamation Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company and each of
its Subsidiaries is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease, license and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing, licensing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification or license, except where
the failure to be so organized, qualified, licensed or in good standing or to
have such power or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company
has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Companys
memorandum of association and bye-laws, each as amended to date.

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 100,000,000 Shares, of which 19,405,736 Shares were outstanding as of the
close of business on July 14, 2006. Since July 14, 2006, no Shares have been
issued except pursuant to the exercise of Company Options. All of the
outstanding Shares have been, and all Shares that may be issued pursuant to
the exercise of outstanding Company Options will be, duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company has no Shares reserved for
issuance, except that, as of June 30, 2006, there were 970,178 Shares reserved
for issuance under outstanding Company Options issued pursuant to the 1994
Stock Plan, which plan has terminated, and there were 47,500 Shares reserved
for issuance under outstanding Company Options issued pursuant to the 2004
Stock Plan. Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list, as of the date hereof, of the prices at which
outstanding Company Options may be exercised, the number of Company Options
outstanding at each such price and the vesting schedule of the Company
Options. Each of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and owned by the Company, free and clear of any lien, pledge, security
interest, claim or other encumbrance. Section 5.1(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and complete list of the Companys
Subsidiaries, including the name, jurisdiction of incorporation or formation
and the Companys percentage ownership, direct or indirect, of capital stock
or other equity interests of each such Subsidiary. Except as set forth above,
there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants,
conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase
rights, agreements, arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind
that obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any
shares of capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or
acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no
securities or obligations evidencing such rights are authorized, issued or
outstanding. There are no outstanding contractual obligations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries restricting the transfer, affecting the voting
rights or requiring the registration for sale of any Shares or any capital
stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement and to consummate, subject only to shareholder approval of this
Agreement by at least three-fourths of those voting at the Company
Shareholders Meeting (the " _Company Requisite Vote_ "), the Amalgamation and
the other transactions involving the Company contemplated by this Agreement.
This  



 

5  Agreement has been duly authorized and executed by the Company and is a
valid and binding agreement of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles
(the " _Bankruptcy and Equity Exception_ ").

(ii) The Board of Directors of the Company has (A) approved this Agreement
and the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (B)
determined that this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Amalgamation, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests
of the Company and the holders of Shares, (C) resolved to recommend that the
holders of Shares vote for the adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Amalgamation at the Company Shareholders Meeting (the " _Company
Recommendation_ "), and (D) received the written opinion of its financial
advisor, Navigant Capital Advisors, LLC (" _Navigant_ "), to the effect that
(subject to the assumptions made, procedures followed, matters considered and
limitations on review undertaken by Navigant, in each case as set forth in
such opinion) the Amalgamation Consideration is fair to the Companys
shareholders (other than the Companys officers and directors) from a
financial point of view.

(d) _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Certain Contracts_. (i) Other than
the filings and/or notices (A) pursuant to Section 1.2, (B) under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
"), and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_
"), (C) to comply with state securities or "blue sky" laws, (D) required to
be made with the Nasdaq National Stock Market, (E) required to be made under
applicable foreign antitrust and competition laws and (F) pursuant to the
Bermuda Act, no notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by
the Company with, nor are any consents, waivers, registrations, approvals,
permits, authorizations, notices or filings required to be made or obtained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to or from, any domestic or foreign
governmental or regulatory authority, agency, commission, body or other
governmental entity (" _Governmental Entity_ "), in connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company and the consummation
by the Company and its Subsidiaries of the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, except those that the failure to make or
obtain would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or
materially impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation by the Company of the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a
breach or violation of, or a default under, the memorandum of association or
bye-laws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, or a default, termination or
cancellation under, or the acceleration of any obligations or the creation of
a lien, pledge, mortgage, security interest, charge or other encumbrance
(each, a " _Lien_ ") on the assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to, any Contracts
(including Material Contracts) binding upon the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any Law or Order applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties is bound
or affected or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of any party
(including requiring any consents or waivers) under any of the Contracts,
except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any breach, violation,
default, termination, cancellation, acceleration, Lien or change that,
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(e) _Company Reports; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_. (i) The
Company has timely filed all registration statements, reports, proxy
statements, information statements, forms or other documents, including any
exhibits, annexes and any amendments thereto, required to be filed by it with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") since December 31,
2003, including the Companys Annual Report on Form 20-F for the years ended
December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (collectively, including any such documents
filed subsequent to the date hereof and as amended, the " _Company Reports_
"). As of their respective dates (or, if amended, as of  



 

6  the date of such amendment), the Company Reports (i) complied in all
material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and Exchange Act, and (ii) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. Each of the consolidated balance
sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including the related notes and schedules) fairly presents the consolidated
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of its date, and
each of the consolidated statements of income, of shareholders equity and of
cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports
(including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents the results of
operations, retained earnings, changes in financial position and cash flows,
as the case may be, of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the periods set
forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to notes and
normal year-end audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or
effect), in each case in accordance with United States generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") consistently applied during the periods
involved, except as may be noted therein. Except for liabilities and
obligations set forth in the Company Reports and except for liabilities and
obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, the Company has no
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on its consolidated
balance sheet or in the notes thereto which, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or to
prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of the Company to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. No enforcement action has
been initiated, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, against
the Company by the SEC relating to disclosures contained in any Company
Reports. The books and records of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries
have been, and will be, maintained in accordance with applicable legal and

(g) _Material Contracts_. (i) Except as disclosed in the Company Reports, none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any Material
Contract. As used in this Agreement, " _Material Contract_ " means any (A)
Contract that would be a contract required to be filed pursuant to Instruction
4 under "Instructions as to Exhibits" in Form 20-F, (B) Contract providing
for aggregate expenditures to or by the Company in excess of $5,000,000, or
annual expenditures to or by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in excess
of $2,500,000 (other than Contracts (I) pursuant to which the amount of
royalty payments vary with the amount of sales of a product to which the

or exclusivity provision that materially limits the right (geographically or
otherwise) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to conduct any line of
business or compete with any Person, or (F) any material IP License that

(ii) Each Material Contract is (A) a valid and binding obligation upon the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, (B) to the
knowledge of the Company, a valid and binding obligation of each other party
thereto, and (C) in full force and effect. No event has occurred that, with or
without notice, the passage of time or both, would constitute a default by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any other party thereto, under any
provision thereof or that would permit modification, cancellation,
foreclosure, imposition of any Lien, prepayment or acceleration or
termination of any Material Contract by any other party thereto or by it,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice regarding any violation or
breach of, or default under, any Material Contract, or any intention to
terminate any such Material Contract prior to the expiration of its stated
term, except for any violation or breach of, default under or intention to
terminate any Material Contract which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(h) _Litigation_. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports filed prior to
the date of this Agreement, (i) there are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and (ii) neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is subject to any outstanding Order, in each case, which would
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or to prevent, materially delay or materially
impair the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.

(i) _Employee Benefits_. (i) All benefit and compensation plans, contracts,
agreements, policies or arrangements covering current or former employees of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries (the " _Employees_ ") and current or
former directors of the Company, including, but not limited to, "employee
benefit plans" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ "), and each material
employment, consulting, severance, termination, retirement, profit sharing,
bonus, incentive or deferred compensation, retention or change in control
plan, program, arrangement, agreement or commitment, and each bonus, stock
option, restricted stock or other equity-based, profit sharing, savings, life,
health, disability, accident, medical, insurance, vacation, other material
fringe benefit or other employee compensation plan, program, arrangement,
agreement or policy (the " _Benefit Plans_ ") are listed on Section 5.1(i) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans
listed on Section 5.1(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including, if
applicable, any trust instruments and insurance contracts forming a part  



 

8  of any Benefit Plans, all amendments thereto and the most recent
determination letters issued by the Internal Revenue Service (the " _IRS_
"), all government and regulatory approvals received from any foreign
governmental authority in respect of any Non-U.S. Benefit Plans (defined
below), the most recent summary plan descriptions (including any material
modifications), the two most recent annual reports on Form 5500 (including
all attachments thereto), the two most recent actuarial reports and the two
most recent audited financial reports for any funded Benefit Plan, have been
made available to Parent.

(ii) All Benefit Plans, other than "multiemployer plans" within the meaning of
Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a " _Multiemployer Plan_ "), and all benefit
plans maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of
Employees working outside of the United States (" _Non-U.S. Benefit Plans_ "),
are in substantial compliance with ERISA, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the " _Code_ "), and other applicable Laws. Each Benefit Plan
which is subject to ERISA (the " _ERISA Plans_ ") that is an "employee pension
benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (" _Pension Plan_
") and that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code, has
received a favorable determination letter from the IRS, covering all tax law
changes prior to the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of
2001 or has applied to the IRS for such favorable determination letter within
the applicable remedial amendment period under Section 401(b) of the Code, and
the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation
of any such favorable determination letter or the loss of the qualification of
such plan under Section 401(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan
that, assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to a tax or
penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA
in an amount which would be material. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred nor reasonably expects to incur a material tax or
penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

(iii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor any entity which is
considered one employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (A) maintains or contributes to or has within the past
six years maintained or contributed to a Pension Plan that is subject to
Subtitles C or D of Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or (B)
maintains or has an obligation to contribute to or has within the past six
years maintained or had an obligation to contribute to a Multiemployer Plan.
All contributions required to be made under the terms of any Benefit Plan, as
of the date hereof, have been timely made or have been reflected on the
Company Reports.

(iv) As of the date hereof, there is no material pending or, to the knowledge
of the Company threatened, litigation relating to the Benefit Plans and no
Benefit Plan is the subject of an audit or investigation by the IRS, the U.S.
Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other
federal, state or local governmental agency, department or authority or any
foreign governmental agency, department or authority. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligations to provide health, accident,
disability, life insurance or death benefits with respect to any current or
former employees, consultants or directors or any retirees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or the spouses, dependents or beneficiaries of any of
the foregoing, beyond the termination of employment or service of any such
employee, consultant, director or retiree, whether under any Benefit Plan or
otherwise, other than as required under Section 4980B of the Code or other
applicable Law. The Company or its applicable Subsidiary may amend or
terminate any such plan at any time without incurring any liability thereunder
other than in respect of claims incurred prior to such amendment or
termination.

(v) There has been no amendment to, announcement by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or
coverage under, any Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense
of maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. None of the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder approval of this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, either alone or in combination with another
event (whether contingent or otherwise), will (A) entitle any current or
former employee, consultant or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any payment, (B) increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due to any such employee,  



 

9  consultant or director, (C) accelerate the vesting, funding or time of
payment of any compensation, equity award or other benefit, (D) result in any
"parachute payment" under Section 280G of the Code (whether or not such
payment would be considered reasonable compensation for services rendered) or
(E) result in payments which would not be deductible under Section 162(m) of
the Code.

(vi) To the extent the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has made any
payments or provided any benefits to any "service provider" that would
constitute "deferred compensation," in each case within the meaning of Section
409A of the Code, such payments have been made, and such benefits have been
provided, in good faith compliance with IRS Notice 2005-1, the proposed
regulations promulgated under Section 409A of the Code prior to the date
hereof, or with the provisions of Section 409A of the Code.

(vii) All stock options granted under the Stock Plans have been granted in
compliance, in all material respects, with the terms of applicable Law and
the applicable Stock Plans and the exercise price of each such option was
determined in accordance with the applicable Stock Plan.

(viii) With respect to each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan: (A) each such plan has
been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
all applicable Laws, (B) all contributions, premiums, accruals, payments or
reimbursements required by applicable Law or the terms of the applicable plan
for all periods ending prior to or as of the date hereof have been made, and
(C) the current value of liabilities under each such plan do not exceed the
assets and reserves set aside under such plan as of the date hereof in an
amount that would be material.

(j) _Compliance with Laws; Permits_. (i) The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all federal, state, local and foreign
laws, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, judgments, orders,
injunctions, decrees, licenses and permits of any Governmental Entity
(collectively, " _Laws_ ") applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which its or any of their respective properties is bound or
affected, except for such non-compliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

(ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has all permits, licenses,
orders and other governmental authorizations, consents and approvals
necessary to own, lease or operate its properties and to conduct its business
as presently conducted (collectively, the " _Permits_ "), except those the
absence of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. There has occurred no
default, revocation or suspension under any such Permit, and no event has
occurred that permits, or upon the giving of notice or passage of time or
both would permit, revocation, non-renewal, modification, suspension,
limitation or termination of any Permit that is currently in effect, except in
each case for any default, revocation, suspension, event, non-
renewal, modification, suspension, limitation or termination that
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(k) _Takeover Statutes_. No "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "business combination" or other similar anti-takeover statute or
regulation or any anti-takeover provision in the Companys memorandum of
association and bye-laws is applicable to the Company, the Shares, the
Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(l) _Environmental Matters_. (i) Except as set forth in the Company Reports
filed prior to the date hereof (A) to the knowledge of the Company, the
Company and its Subsidiaries are now and have always been in compliance, in
all material respects, with all applicable Environmental Laws and have all
permits necessary to conduct current operations; and (B) there have not been
any Hazardous Substances used, generated, treated, stored, transported,
disposed of, or released on, under, about, or emanating to or from any
property currently or previously owned, leased or operated by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries at the time such property was owned, leased or
operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries except as permitted under
applicable Environmental Laws.



 

10 (ii) Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed prior to the date
hereof, the Company and its Subsidiaries (A) are not the subject of any
pending written notice from any Governmental Entity or any other Person
alleging a material violation of, or liability under, any applicable
Environmental Laws nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is the Company or
any Subsidiaries aware of any probable basis for such a notice; and (B) are
not, to the knowledge of the Company, currently subject to any investigation,
court order, administrative order or decree arising under any
Environmental Law. The Company has made available to Parent copies of all
environmental reports, studies, assessments and sampling data in its
possession or control relating to any properties currently or previously
owned, leased or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

(m) _Taxes_. (i) The Company and its Subsidiaries (A) have prepared in good
faith and duly and timely filed (taking into account any extension of time
within which to file) all Tax Returns (as defined below) required to be filed
by any of them and all such filed Tax Returns are complete and accurate in all
material respects; (B) have paid all Taxes (as defined below) that are due
and owing, whether or not shown as due on such filed Tax Returns, except with
respect to matters contested in good faith; and (C) have not waived any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any extension of

made in writing for any such waiver or extension. No deficiencies for Taxes of
the Company or its Subsidiaries have been claimed, proposed or assessed by
any authority and, as of the date hereof, there are not pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened, any audits, examinations, investigations
or other proceedings in respect of Taxes or Tax matters. No claim has ever
been made by an authority in a jurisdiction where the Company and its
Subsidiaries do not file Tax Returns that any of them is or may be subject to
taxation by that jurisdiction. The Company has made available to Parent true
and correct copies of all Tax Returns filed by the Company and its
Subsidiaries for each of the fiscal years ended December 31, 2005 (if any),
2004 and 2003, and complete and accurate copies of all examination reports and
statements of deficiencies assessed against, and received by, or agreed to,
by any of the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective predecessors)
since December 31, 2001. The Company is not currently the beneficiary of any
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return. No power of attorney
(other than powers of attorney authorizing employees of the Company to act on
behalf of the Company) with respect to any Taxes has been executed or filed
with any authority.

(ii) The unpaid Taxes of the Company did not, as of the date of the most
recent Company financial statements included in the Company Reports, exceed
the reserve for Tax liability (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes
established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income) set
forth on the face of the balance sheets (rather than in any notes thereto)
contained in the most recent Company financial statements included in the
Company Reports. Since the date of the most recent Company financial
statements included in the Company Reports, the Company has not incurred any
liability for Taxes outside the ordinary course of business or otherwise
inconsistent with past custom and practice.

(iii) There are no Liens for Taxes on any assets of the Company other than
Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable.

(iv) There are no Tax-sharing agreements or similar arrangements (including
indemnity arrangements) with respect to or involving the Company, and, after
the Effective Time, the Company shall not be bound by any such Tax-sharing
agreements or similar arrangements or have any liability thereunder for
amounts due in respect of periods prior to the Effective Time.

(v) The Company has never been a member of a group filing a consolidated Tax

foreign Law), (B) as a transferee or successor, (C) by contract, or (D)
otherwise.

corporation within the meaning of Section 897(c)(2) of the Code during the
applicable period specified in section 897(c)(1)(A)(ii) of the Code.

(viii) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries incorporated outside
of the United States is a "surrogate foreign corporation" within the meaning
of Section 7874(a)(2)(B) of the Code or is treated as a U.S. corporation under
Section 7874(b) of the Code.

(n) _Labor Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a
party to or otherwise bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract
or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor organization,
nor, as of the date hereof, is the Company or any of its Subsidiaries the
subject of any material proceeding asserting that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel it to
bargain with any labor union or labor organization nor is there pending or, to
the knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has there been for the past
five years, any employee strike, material labor dispute, walk-out, work
stoppage, slow-down or lockout involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. There are no claims, controversies, investigations, legal
proceedings or complaints pending or, to knowledge of the Company,
threatened, by any Governmental Entity, any employees, any party or parties
representing any of such employees, or any former employer of a current
employee, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before any
court, arbitrator or other tribunal that are reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(o) _Insurance_. All material fire and casualty, general liability, business
interruption, product liability and sprinkler and water damage insurance
policies maintained by the Company and its Subsidiaries are with reputable
insurance carriers and are of such character and in such amounts as are in
accordance with normal industry practice for companies engaged in similar
businesses.

(p) _Real Property; Assets_. (i) Section 5.1(p) of the Company Disclosure
Letter identifies (A) a complete, accurate and current list of all real
property owned by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof and
(B) a complete, accurate and current list of all real property leased or
subleased by the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof
(collectively, the " _Leased Properties_ "). Copies of the lease agreements
under which each Leased Property is leased (the " _Leases_ ") have been made
available to Parent. No event has occurred that, with or without notice, the
passage of time or both, would cause a breach or default under any such Lease,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to,
or, in the case of Leased Properties and other leased assets, valid leasehold
interests in, all of its material tangible properties and assets, real,
personal and mixed, used or held for use in its business, free and clear of
any Liens, easements, title defects, deeds of trust, rights of way,
restrictive covenants, encroachments or similar restrictions or limitations,
except (A) as reflected in the Companys most recent balance sheet contained
in the Company Reports, statutory landlord Liens or Liens arising under
equipment leases entered into in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, (B) Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable, (C) such
imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, that do not in any material
respect detract from the value or interfere with the present use of the
property subject thereto or affected thereby, and (D) except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(q) _Intellectual Property_. (i) Section 5.1(q) of the Company
Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of (A) all registered patents,
trademarks, copyrights, mask works and applications therefor owned by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, indicating the name of the registered

12  all Intellectual Property that is Used in, or necessary for, the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted (collectively, "
_Business Intellectual Property_ "), except for any such failures to own, be
licensed or possess that individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement will not change, or constitute or
result in any change, in the rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
to Use the Business Intellectual Property, except for any such change that
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. With respect to Business Intellectual
Property owned by, or in the case of copyrights, exclusively licensed to, the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Owned Intellectual
Property_ "), neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has granted any
security interests, rights of first refusal, rights of first negotiation,
options, calls or puts in any Business Intellectual Property. The Owned
Intellectual Property is valid, subsisting, in full force and effect and to
the Companys knowledge, enforceable, and the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
own all right, title and interest therein (including the sole right
to enforce) free and clear of all Liens.

(iii) Except as disclosed in Company Reports:

(A) neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any IP
License or other Material Contract as to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and pursuant to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries purports to have the right to Use any Business Intellectual
Property from third parties (collectively, " _Third-Party
Intellectual Property_ "), except for any such failures to own, be licensed
or possess that individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries will be in violation of any such agreement as a
result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the performance of
the Companys obligations hereunder;

(B) no claims, litigation, oppositions, cancellations, proceedings or
objections with respect to (I) Owned Intellectual Property or (II) to the
knowledge of the Company, Third-Party Intellectual Property, are currently
pending or are threatened by any Person;

(C) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no valid ground for any bona
fide claims (I) to the effect that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates (including in the
manufacture, sale, licensing or use of any product as now Used, sold or
licensed or proposed for use, sale or license by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) any Intellectual Property of any Person; (II) against the use by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any Business Intellectual Property
Used in the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted or as proposed to be conducted; (III) challenging the ownership,
validity or enforceability of any of the Owned Intellectual Property; or (IV)
challenging any license or right to Use the Third-Party Intellectual Property
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of (III) or
(IV), as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(D) to the knowledge of the Company, there is no unauthorized use,
infringement or misappropriation of any of the Owned Intellectual Property by

a Company Material Adverse Effect;

(E) the Company has taken reasonable measures to protect and preserve the
trade secret status of all trade secrets that are Business Intellectual
Property. It is the policy of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to
require all employees and consultants to enter into or be bound by
confidentiality agreements or undertakings for the benefit of the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries which require such employees and consultants to
maintain the confidence of its trade secrets. All material
Intellectual Property developed on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries either constitutes work made for hire or has been assigned to the
Company;



 

13 (F) all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries information technology
systems and computers, and Owned Intellectual Property (and all parts
thereof), have not materially malfunctioned or failed within the past three
years and otherwise operate as required by the Company and its Subsidiaries in
connection with their respective businesses; and

(G) To the knowledge of the Company and its Subsidiaries, none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice asserting such
Companys or Subsidiarys breach of, or default under, any Material Contract
that is an IP License, or written notice of any intention of the other party
thereto to terminate any such IP License prior to the expiration of its
stated term, where the breach or default under, or termination of, such IP
License would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse effect on
the Companys or a Subsidiarys rights with respect to a Key Product.

(r) _Affiliate Transactions_. Except as disclosed in the Company Reports,
there are no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings between
(i) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and (ii) any
Affiliate of the Company (other than the Companys Subsidiaries), on the other
hand, of the type that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act.

(s) _Product Liability_. The Company is not aware of any claim, or event that
would be reasonably likely to result in a claim, against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries for injury to any person or property of employees or any
third parties suffered as a result of the sale of any product or performance
of any service by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including claims
arising out of the defective or unsafe nature of its products or services,
which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(t) _Foreign Corrupt Practices Act_. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries, nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any agent or employee
has, directly or indirectly, materially violated any applicable provision of
the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended.

(u) _Brokers and Finders_. Neither the Company nor any of its officers,
directors or employees has employed any broker or finder or incurred any
liability for any brokerage fees, commissions or finders fees in connection
with the Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated hereby, except

arrangements with which have been disclosed to Parent prior to the date
hereof. The Company has made available to Parent a true and correct copy of
all engagement letters relating to arrangements with Navigant.

each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub hereby represents and warrants to the
Company that:

any of the Contracts, except, in the case of clause (B) or (C) above, for any

change that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

and that it shall not authorize or permit its or any of its Subsidiaries
employees, agents and representatives to, directly or indirectly, initiate,
solicit, encourage or otherwise facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, amalgamation or similar transaction involving the Company, or
with respect to any purchase, acquisition, assignment, lease or transfer of
25% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company or 25% or more of the
equity securities of the Company, or any combination of the foregoing (any
such proposal or offer being hereinafter referred to as an " _Acquisition
Proposal_ "). The Company further agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers and directors shall, and
that it shall not authorize or permit its or any of its Subsidiaries
employees, agents and representatives to, directly or indirectly, engage in
any negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data
to, or have any discussions with, any Person relating to a proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal, otherwise facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into an agreement or agreement in principle
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

(b) The provisions of Section 6.2(a) shall not prevent the Company or its
Board of Directors, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote and subject
to complying with the terms of this Agreement, from (A) complying with its
disclosure obligations under applicable Law; (B) providing information in
response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from such
Person requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms no more favorable to such person than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that  



 

17  such confidentiality agreement need not prohibit the making, or amendment,
of an Acquisition Proposal); (C) engaging in any negotiations or
discussions with any Person who has made an unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal; (D) recommending such an Acquisition Proposal to the
shareholders of the Company; or (E) entering into a binding written agreement
concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal, if, (i) in
each case referred to in clause (B), (C), (D) and/or (E) above, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and the Companys financial advisor that such action is
likely to be required in order for its directors to comply with their
respective fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) in each case
referred to in clause (D) and/or (E) above, (x) the Company has given Parent
five business days prior written notice (such five business day period to
recommence upon notification by the Company of any material change to the
applicable Acquisition Proposal) of its intention to take any such action
(including attaching the most current version of any such binding written
agreement referred to in clause (E) above) and (y) at the end of such five
business day period, after taking into account any adjusted, modified or
amended terms proposed by Parent, the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal, if accepted,
has substantially the same likelihood of consummation as the Amalgamation,
taking into account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the
proposal and the Person making the proposal, and would, if consummated, result
in a transaction more favorable to the Companys shareholders from a
financial point of view than the Amalgamation (any Acquisition Proposal as to
which the Companys Board of Directors make such good faith determination
being referred to in this Agreement as a " _Superior Proposal_ "). The
Company agrees that it will not recommend to the shareholders of the Company
an Acquisition Proposal referred to in clause (D) above or enter into a
binding agreement referred to in clause (E) above until, in each case, at
least the sixth business day after it has provided the notice (or revised
notice, as the case may be) to Parent required under the previous sentence.
The Company agrees that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

(c) The Company agrees that it will notify Parent promptly (and in any event
within twenty-four (24) hours) upon receipt of any Acquisition Proposal by it
or any of its representatives, including the material terms of such proposal,
the identity of the potential acquiror, any information requested from the
Company, or of any negotiations or discussions being sought to be initiated
with the Company. The Company shall keep Parent fully informed on a
prompt basis with respect to any material changes to the applicable
Acquisition Proposal, the Companys intention to enter into an Acquisition
Proposal or any other material developments with respect to the foregoing. The
Company will simultaneously provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to any Person that was not
previously provided to Parent.

6.3. _Company Shareholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its memorandum of association and bye-laws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Company
Shareholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the date hereof to
consider and vote upon this Agreement. Subject to fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law, the Companys Board of Directors shall recommend approval of
this Agreement and shall take all lawful action to solicit such approval. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall prevent the Companys Board of
Directors from withholding, withdrawing, amending or modifying
its recommendation that the Companys shareholders vote in favor of this
Agreement if the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel and the Companys financial advisor
that it is necessary to do so in order to act in a manner consistent with
their fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided that Section 6.2 shall
govern the withholding, withdrawing, amendment or modifying of such
recommendation in the circumstances described therein.

6.4. _Information Supplied_. (a) The Company agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information included or incorporated by
reference (i) in the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto,
at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of the Company
Shareholder Meeting, and (ii) in any other filings required to be made by the
Company with the SEC in connection with the Amalgamation, or any amendment or
supplement thereto (collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "), at the time of
filing and at any distribution or dissemination thereof, will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any  



 

18  material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Companys covenants
contained in clauses (i) and (ii) above will not apply to statements or
omissions included in the Proxy Statement or any Other Filings based
upon information furnished in writing to the Company by Parent or
Amalgamation Sub specifically for use therein. The Company agrees that the
Proxy Statement and any Other Filings, and any amendments or supplements
thereto, when filed by the Company with the SEC, or when distributed or
otherwise disseminated to the Companys shareholders, as applicable, will
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act (including a form of proxy statement that complies as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of Section 14(a) of the
Exchange Act as if such section were applicable to the Company) and other
applicable Laws.

(b) Parent agrees, as to itself and Amalgamation Sub, that none of the
information supplied or to be supplied by it or Amalgamation Sub in
writing specifically for use in (i) the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto, at the date of mailing to shareholders and at the time of
the Company Shareholders Meeting, or (ii) any Other Filing, at the time of
filing and at any distribution or dissemination thereof, will contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.

6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_. (a) In connection with the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable prepare a proxy statement relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Amalgamation (the " _Proxy Statement_
") in accordance with applicable Law, including the Bermuda Act, and shall
file or furnish the Proxy Statement with the SEC no later than thirty (30)
days after the date of this Agreement. The Company shall mail the Proxy
Statement to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter. The Company shall as promptly as practicable notify Parent and
Amalgamation Sub of the receipt of any oral or written comments from the SEC
relating to any request from the SEC for amendments of, or supplements
to, the Proxy Statement, as well as any request by the SEC for additional
information relating to the Proxy Statement. The Company (in consultation with
Parent and Amalgamation Sub) shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
to the comments of the SEC, if any, with respect to the Proxy Statement
(including filing all exhibits and other document required to be so filed with
the SEC in response to such comments). The Company shall provide Parent and
Amalgamation Sub with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
drafts of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto)
and all responses to requests, if any, for additional information by and
replies to comments of the SEC, prior to filing such with, or sending such
to, the SEC. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, any
information should be discovered by any party that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that the Proxy Statement
would not include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall
promptly notify the other parties hereto and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed by the Company with the SEC
and disseminated by the Company to the shareholders of the Company;
_provided_ that prior to such mailing of any amendment or supplement, the
Company shall provide Parent with the right to review and comment on such
amendment or supplement as described in this Section 6.5. Subject to Section
6.2, the Proxy Statement shall contain the Company Recommendation.

(b) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause
to be done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part hereunder
and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Amalgamation and the
other transactions contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including
preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect
all necessary notices, reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, registrations, approvals, permits and authorizations
necessary or advisable to be obtained from any third party (including
shareholders) and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Amalgamation or any of the other transactions  



 

19  contemplated hereby. Subject to Section 6.5(a) and applicable Laws relating
to the exchange of information, to the extent practicable, Parent and
the Company shall have the right to reasonably collaborate in connection with
any communication that Parent or the Company makes to any Governmental Entity
regarding the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby
before such communication is made.

(c) The Company shall, upon request by Parent, furnish Parent, the SEC and any
other Governmental Entities with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Amalgamation and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Parent shall, upon request by the Company, furnish the Company, the SEC
and any other Governmental Entities with all information concerning itself and
Amalgamation Sub and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement or any other statement,
filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Amalgamation and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(e) The Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status
of matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other
communications received by Parent, Amalgamation Sub, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

6.6.  _Access_. Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be
required by applicable Law, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers, employees, counsel, accountants and
other authorized representatives reasonable access, during normal business
hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties,
books, contracts, records, officers, employees and representatives and, during
such period, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to)
furnish promptly to Parent all information concerning its business,
properties, Contracts, financial data, personnel and other information as may
reasonably be requested, _provided_ that the foregoing shall not require the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to permit any inspection, or to disclose
any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties if the Company shall
have used reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to
such inspection or disclosure. All requests for information made pursuant to
this Section shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company, as the
case may be, or such Person as may be designated by the Companys officers,
as the case may be. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

6.7. _Publicity_. The initial press release with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release and thereafter the Company
and Parent each shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the
Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated hereby and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities interdealer quotation service) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities interdealer
quotation service.

6.8. _Certain Notices_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party
hereto of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to
be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement that would reasonably be
expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any party to effect
the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied; _provided_ ,  



 

20   _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.8
shall not cure any breach of any representation or warranty
requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the date of this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

6.9. _FIRPTA Certificate_. Prior to the Application Date, the Company shall
deliver to Parent such forms and certificates, duly executed and acknowledged,
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, certifying that the
Amalgamation is exempt from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

6.10. _Benefits_. Subject to the terms of any collective bargaining agreement
currently in effect or which may be in effect in the future, Parent agrees
that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
second anniversary thereof, the employees of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries will continue to be provided with benefits under employee benefit
plans that will be substantially similar in the aggregate to those currently
provided by the Company and each of its Subsidiaries to such employees.
Parent shall, or shall cause the Amalgamated Company to, honor in accordance
with their terms: (a) all employee benefit obligations to current and former
employees of the Company accrued as of the Effective Time, (b) to the extent
set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, all employment or severance
agreements entered into prior to the date hereof and (c) the severance plan
terms set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter without amendment for one
year immediately following the Effective Time. Subject to the terms of any
collective bargaining agreement currently in effect or which may be in effect
in the future, Parent will cause each employee benefit plan of Parent in which
employees of the Company are eligible to participate to take into account for
purposes of eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (other than benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan) thereunder the service of such
employees with the Company as if such service were with Parent to the same
extent that such service was credited under a comparable plan of the Company.

6.11.  _Expenses_. The Amalgamated Company shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the
transactions contemplated in Article IV, and Parent shall reimburse the
Amalgamated Company for such charges and expenses. Whether or not the
Amalgamation is consummated, except as set forth in Section 8.5(b), Section
8.5(c) and Section 8.5(d), all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expense.

6.12. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. (a) Parent and
the Amalgamated Company jointly and severally shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the extent permitted under the Companys memorandum of
association and by-laws and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence
on the date of this Agreement, each present and former director, officer and
employee of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a)
of this Section, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify in writing Parent or the Amalgamated
Company, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent or the
Amalgamated Company of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if
such failure does not materially prejudice Parent or the Amalgamated Company.
In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
(whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent or the
Amalgamated Company shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and
neither Parent nor the Amalgamated Company shall be liable to such
Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Parties in connection with
the defense thereof, except that if Parent or the Amalgamated Company elects
not to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Parent or the
Amalgamated Company and the Indemnified Parties such that it would be
unethical or inappropriate for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Parties, on one hand, and Parent and  



 

21  Amalgamation Sub, on the other hand, the Indemnified Parties may retain
counsel satisfactory to them, and Parent or the Amalgamated Company shall pay
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably promptly as statements therefor are received; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and the Amalgamated Company shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (b) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Parties (in addition to any local counsel) unless the use of one
counsel for such Indemnified Parties would present such counsel with such a
conflict of interest, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the
defense of any such matter and (iii) neither Parent nor the Amalgamated
Company shall be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that neither Parent nor the Amalgamated Company shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of competent
jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination shall have
become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law. Parent may not agree to
any settlement of any such claim or action, other than solely for monetary
damages for which Parent shall be responsible hereunder, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, unless such settlement includes an explicit and
unconditional release from the party bringing such claim. In any action
hereunder as to which Parent has assumed the defense thereof, the Indemnified
Party shall continue to be entitled to participate in the defense thereof,
with counsel of its own choice, but Parent shall not be obligated hereunder
to reimburse the indemnified party of the costs or expenses thereof, except as
otherwise provided in this Section. If the indemnity provided for by this
Section is not available with respect to any Indemnified Party, then the
Amalgamated Company and the Indemnified Party shall contribute to the amount
payable in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect relative faults and
benefits.

(c) The Amalgamated Company shall maintain, and Parent shall cause the
Amalgamated Company to maintain, the Companys existing officers
and directors liability insurance for a period of six years after the
Effective Time ( _provided_ that coverage limits in the aggregate for the
entire six-year period are not less than the current annual limits, _provided_
,  _further_ , that if such coverage is unavailable, the Amalgamated Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain substantially equivalent
coverage) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Amalgamated Company be required to expend more than an amount per year
equal to 200% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such
insurance; _provided further_ ,  _however_ , that if the premiums for such
coverage exceed such amount, the Amalgamated Company shall purchase a policy
with the greatest coverage available for such 200% of the current annual
premiums paid by the Company. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or the
Amalgamated Company may obtain a "tail" policy of substantially equivalent
coverage and amounts containing terms no less favorable to such former
directors or officers covering events occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time for a period of not fewer than six (6) years after the Effective Time at
a cost not to exceed 200% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company
for the year ended December 31, 2005.

(d) If Parent or the Amalgamated Company or any of their respective successors
or assigns (i) shall consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Amalgamated Company shall
assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section.

(e) The provisions of this Section are intended to be for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their representatives.

6.13. _Guarantee_. Mattel hereby fully and unconditionally guarantees to the
Company the performance of all obligations hereunder of Parent, Amalgamation
Sub and any of their respective assignees permitted under Section 9.13 (the "
_Permitted Assignees_ ") and the due and punctual payment by Parent,
Amalgamation Sub and any of their respective Permitted Assignees in full of
any amounts payable by Parent, Amalgamation Sub and any of their respective
Permitted Assignees pursuant to this Agreement.

conditions set forth in Section 7.1(b) and Section 7.1(c) hereof, and
such conditions are capable of being satisfied on or prior to January 31,

consummated.

8.3.  _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Amalgamation may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time, by
action of the Board of Directors of the Company:

(a) if, prior to obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, (i) the Company is not
in material breach of any of the terms of this Agreement, and (ii) if
permitted by, and in compliance with, Section 6.2, the Board of Directors  



 

24  of the Company authorizes the Company to enter into a binding written
agreement concerning a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal; or

 

(b) if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Parent or Amalgamation Sub in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty shall have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement, such that Section 7.3(a) or 7.3(b) would not be satisfied and such
breach or condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured within 20 days
after written notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent.

8.4. _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and
the Amalgamation may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by
action of the Board of Directors of Parent if (a) the Board of Directors of

Company that they approve an Acquisition Proposal or failed to reconfirm its
recommendation of this Agreement within five business days after a written
request by Parent to do so, (b) there has been a breach of any

8.5. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. (a) In the event of termination
of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Amalgamation pursuant to this
Article VIII, this Agreement (other than as set forth in Section 9.1) shall
become void and of no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto
(or of any of its directors, officers, employees, agents, legal and financial
advisors or other representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , except as
otherwise provided herein, no such termination shall relieve any party hereto
of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or intentional breach
of this Agreement.

(b) Without limiting Parents rights under Section 8.5(c) or 8.5(d), the
Company shall pay Parent a termination fee of $6,940,764 (the " _Termination
Fee_ "), _plus_ up to an aggregate amount of $1,500,000 of all out-of-pocket
expenses of Parent and its Affiliates, including fees and expenses of
financial advisors, outside legal counsel, accountants, experts and
consultants incurred by Parent and its Affiliates or on their respective
behalf in connection with or related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby (the " _Parent Expenses_ ") in the event that this
Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.3(a), or (ii)
by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(b), if, solely with respect to the foregoing
clause (ii), (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company
or its shareholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention
to make an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company prior to such
termination and (B) within 12 months of such termination, the Company
consummates a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to
fifty percent (50%)). In the event of a Termination Fee and Parent Expenses
payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(i), such fee and expenses shall be paid to
Parent upon termination of this Agreement, and in the event of a Termination
Fee and Parent Expenses payable pursuant to Section 8.5(b)(ii), such fee and
expenses shall be paid to Parent upon the consummation of the definitive
agreement in connection with the applicable Acquisition Proposal.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.4(a),
then, without limiting Parents rights under Section 8.5(b) or 8.5(d), upon
termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent an amount equal
to the Parent Expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that if within 12 months of
such termination, the Company enters into or consummates a
definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (with all
percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to fifty
percent (50%)), then the Company shall also pay to Parent an amount equal to
the Termination Fee upon consummation of such definitive agreement (even if
such consummation occurs following such 12 month period).



 

25 (d) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.2(b), then, without limiting Parents rights under Section 8.5(b)
or 8.5(c), upon termination of this Agreement, the Company shall pay to Parent
an amount equal to the Parent Expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A)
an Acquisition Proposal shall have been made to the Company or its
shareholders or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make
an Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company prior to such termination
and (B) within 12 months of such termination, the Company enters into or
consummates a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
(with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal increased to
fifty percent (50%)), then upon the earlier of the execution or consummation
of such definitive agreement, the Company shall also pay to Parent an amount
equal to the Termination Fee.

(e) The Companys payment of the Termination Fee and Parent Expenses, as
applicable, shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and Amalgamation
Sub against the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, advisors or other representatives with respect
to the breach of any covenant or agreement giving rise to such payment. Parent
and the Company acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 8.5
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay promptly any amount due
pursuant to this Section 8.5 and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount
set forth in this Section 8.5, the non-prevailing party shall pay the
prevailing partys costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees
and expenses) in connection with such suit.

arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of
the provisions of this Agreement.

obligations hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , that Amalgamation Sub may only
assign its rights and obligations hereunder to a company incorporated and
governed by the laws of Bermuda.

9.14. _Specific Performance._ The parties agree that if any of the provisions

Agreement, in addition to any other remedy at law or equity.
