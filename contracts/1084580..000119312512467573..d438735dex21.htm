stock split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of stock, or any stock
dividend or stock distribution (other than the distribution contemplated by
_Section 5.15_) with a record date during such period, the Common Exchange
Ratio and Preferred Exchange Ratio will be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change.

 



5 (f) _Section 382 Limitation_.

 

(i) If, as a result of the conversion of New Jefferies Common Shares into the
right to receive Leucadia Common Stock pursuant to the Second Merger, any
Person who was not previously a "5-percent shareholder" would (x) become a
"5-percent shareholder" in respect of Leucadia or (y) be treated as owning 5%
or more of the outstanding shares of Leucadia Common Stock after the Second
Merger, in each case, as determined by the Leucadia Board of Directors in
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.382-2T(g)(k), Leucadia shall
cause the Exchange Agent to sell the minimum number of shares of Leucadia
Common Stock necessary that are otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement so that such Person would not be treated as (A) a "5-percent
shareholder" in respect of Leucadia or (B) owning 5% or more of
the outstanding shares of Leucadia Common Stock after the Second Merger ("
_Excess Leucadia Common Stock_ ").

(ii) Leucadia shall cause the Exchange Agent to execute the sale of any
Excess Leucadia Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange in round lots to
the extent practicable. Leucadia shall cause the Exchange Agent to use all
reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Excess Leucadia Common Stock
as promptly following the Second Effective Time as, in the Exchange Agents
reasonable judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining the best
execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions. Leucadia
shall cause the Exchange Agent to apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess
Leucadia Common Stock, and any amounts received from a Purported Holder (as
defined below) pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(iii)_, as follows: (A) first, an
amount up to the fair market value of the Excess Leucadia Common Stock,
calculated on the basis of the closing market price for Leucadia Common Stock
on the day before the Closing Date, shall be paid to the holder of
New Jefferies Common Shares that would otherwise be entitled to receive such
Excess Leucadia Common Stock (the " _Purported Holder_ ") and (B) second, any
remaining amounts shall be paid to the Leucadia Foundation or any one or
more organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code (and any
comparable successor provision) selected by the Leucadia Board of Directors.

(iii) Any delivery of Excess Leucadia Common Stock to a Purported Holder shall
be prohibited and treated as void _ab initio_. No employee or agent of
Leucadia shall record the issuance of any Excess Leucadia Common Stock to a
Purported Holder, and the Purported Holder shall not be recognized as a
shareholder of Leucadia for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Excess
Leucadia Common Stock. The Purported Holder shall not be entitled with
respect to such Excess Leucadia Common Stock to any rights of shareholders of
Leucadia, including without limitation, the right to vote such Excess Leucadia
Common Stock or to receive dividends or distributions, whether liquidating
or otherwise, in respect thereof, if any. Upon discovery by Leucadia that,
notwithstanding the above, a Purported Holder has received any Excess Leucadia
Common Stock, then, upon written demand by Leucadia, the Purported Holder
shall transfer or cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence
of ownership of the Excess Leucadia Common Stock within the Purported Holders
possession or control, together with any dividends or other distributions that
were received by the Purported Holder from Leucadia with respect to the
Excess Leucadia Common Stock (" _Prohibited Distributions_ "), to the Exchange
Agent (or any other agent appointed by Leucadia), and Leucadia shall cause the
Exchange Agent (or such other agent) to sell such Excess Leucadia Common
Stock in accordance with _Section 2.2(f)(ii)_. If the Purported Holder has
sold the Excess Leucadia Common Stock before receiving Leucadias demand to
surrender the Excess Leucadia Common Stock, the Purported Holder shall be
deemed to have sold the Excess Leucadia Common Stock on behalf of the Exchange
Agent (or such other agent), and shall be required to transfer to the Exchange
Agent (or such other agent) any Prohibited Distributions and the proceeds of
such sale, except to the extent that the Exchange Agent (or such other agent)
grants written permission to the Purported Holder to retain a portion of such
Prohibited Distributions or sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the
Purported Holder would have received from the Exchange Agent (or such other
agent) pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)(ii)_.

(g) _No Fractional Shares_.

(i) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Leucadia
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates,
no dividends or other distributions of Leucadia shall

 



6  relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of a
stockholder of Leucadia. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, each holder of Common Shares who would otherwise have been entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Leucadia Common Stock as a result of the
Second Merger (after taking into account all Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book Entry Shares delivered
by such holder) shall be entitled to receive, from the Exchange Agent in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.2(g)_, a cash payment in
lieu of such fractional shares representing such holders proportionate
interest, if any, in the proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent in one
or more transactions of Leucadia Common Stock as provided for below.

 

(ii) As promptly as practicable following the Second Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (A) the number of full shares of
Leucadia Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by Leucadia pursuant to
_Section 2.3(a)_ less (B) the aggregate number of full shares of Leucadia
Common Stock to be distributed to holders of New Jefferies Common Shares
pursuant to _Section 2.3(b)_ (such excess, the " _Excess Shares_ ").
Following the Second Effective Time, the Exchange Agent, as agent for the
holders of New Jefferies Common Shares, shall sell the Excess Shares at the
then-prevailing prices on the New York Stock Exchange, all in the manner
provided in _Section 2.2(g)(iii)_.

(iii) The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on
the New York Stock Exchange in round lots to the extent practicable. The
Exchange Agent shall use all reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the
Excess Shares as promptly following the Second Effective Time as, in the
Exchange Agents reasonable judgment, is practicable consistent with obtaining
the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market conditions.
Until the proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed to the holders
of New Jefferies Common Shares, the Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in
trust for the holders of New Jefferies Common Shares (the " _Common
Shares Trust_ "). Leucadia shall pay all commissions, transfer taxes and
other out-of-pocket transaction costs, including the expenses and
compensation, of the Exchange Agent incurred in connection with such sale of
the Excess Shares. The Exchange Agent shall determine the portion of the New
Jefferies Common Shares Trust to which each holder of New Jefferies Common
Shares shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate
proceeds comprising the Common Shares Trust by a fraction the numerator of
which is the amount of the fractional share interest to which such holder of
New Jefferies Common Shares is entitled (after taking into account all New
Jefferies Common Shares held at the Second Effective Time by such holder) and
the denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional share interests
to which all holders of New Jefferies Common Shares are entitled.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, no New
Jefferies Common Shares that are owned by New Jefferies or a wholly-owned
Subsidiary of New Jefferies, other than New Jefferies Common Shares that are
held in street name for the benefit of third parties, shall be entitled to
receive cash pursuant to this _Section 2.2(g)_ and no such shares will be
taken into account in determining the amount of cash to which any other
holder is entitled pursuant to this _Section 2.2(g)_.

(v) Fractional shares of Leucadia Mirror Preferred Stock may be issued in
exchange for New Jefferies Preferred Shares.

(h) _Treatment of Awards_. Jefferies and Leucadia shall take all requisite
action so that, as of the Second Effective Time, each right of any kind,
contingent or accrued, to receive New Jefferies Common Shares or benefits
measured in whole or in part by the value of a number of New Jefferies
Common Shares granted under the Jefferies Group, Inc. Incentive Compensation
Plan, the Jefferies Group, Inc. 1999 Directors Stock Compensation, or the
Jefferies Deferred Compensation Plan (together, the " _Jefferies Award Plans_
", and each such right, an " _Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall cease to
represent an Award with respect to New Jefferies Common Shares, and shall be
converted by virtue of the Transactions and without any action on the part of
the holder of that Award, into an award with respect to a number of shares of
Leucadia Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the aggregate number of New
Jefferies Common Shares subject to such Award, multiplied by the (ii) Common
Exchange

 



7  Ratio, which product shall be rounded down to the nearest whole share (as
converted, a " _Converted Stock-Based Award_ "). All Converted Stock-Based
Awards shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions set forth in the applicable Jefferies Award Plan (or any other
agreement to which such Converted Stock-Based Award was subject immediately
prior to the Second Effective Time), except as otherwise provided herein. The
exercise price (if any) per share of Leucadia Common Stock applicable to
Converted Stock-Based Awards shall be equal to (A) the aggregate exercise
price of such Award immediately prior to the Second Effective Time divided by
(B) the number of shares of Leucadia Common Stock for which such Converted
Stock-Based Award shall be exercisable as determined in accordance with the
first sentence of this paragraph, rounded down to the nearest cent. Prior to
the Second Effective Time, Jefferies and Leucadia shall make such amendments
and take such other actions with respect to the Jefferies Award Plans as shall
be necessary to effect the adjustment referred to in this _Section 2.2(h)_,
including notifying all participants in the Jefferies Award Plans of such
adjustment.

Section 2.3 _Exchange of New Jefferies Common Shares and New Jefferies

Subsidiaries is the common parent, within the meaning of Section 1504(a)(1)

maintenance and processing of personal information, including financial
information, collected, used, maintained or processed by Jefferies or its
Subsidiaries, except for any such non-compliance, default or violation that
has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Jefferies Material Adverse Effect. No claim is pending or,
to the Knowledge of Jefferies, threatened, with respect to the collection,
use, maintenance or processing of personal information, including financial

of the outstanding Common Shares on the record date for the determination of

sufficient votes to obtain the Jefferies

 



20  Stockholder Approval, the " _Jefferies Stockholder Approval Matters_ "). The

prohibit or restrict the ability of Jefferies to enter into this Agreement or
to consummate the Transactions or of the Jefferies stockholders party to the
Jefferies Voting Agreements to perform their respective obligations
thereunder.

42 Section 5.4 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) Each of Jefferies and Leucadia shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to take or cause to be taken such actions as may be required to be taken
under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any other federal securities Laws,
any applicable state securities or "blue sky" Laws and any stock exchange
requirements in connection with the Transactions, including in
connection with preparation and delivery of the Transaction SEC Filings. In
connection with the First Merger, the Second Merger, the Jefferies Meeting and
the Leucadia Meeting, Jefferies and Leucadia, as appropriate, shall prepare
and file with the SEC the Transaction SEC Filings, and Jefferies and
Leucadia, as appropriate, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond
to the comments of the SEC and have the Form S4 declared effective by the SEC
under the Securities Act and thereafter to cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to Jefferies stockholders and Leucadias stockholders, all as promptly
as reasonably practicable and use all commercially reasonable efforts to keep
the Form S4 effective as long as reasonably necessary to consummate the
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to the filing of the
Transaction SEC Filings, each party shall consult with the other party with
respect to such filings and shall afford the other party and
its Representatives reasonable opportunity to comment thereon. Each party
shall provide the other party with any information for inclusion in the
Transaction SEC Filings that may be required under applicable Law or that is
reasonably requested by each other party. Each party shall notify the other
party of the receipt of comments from the SEC and of any request from the SEC
for amendments or supplements to the Transaction SEC Filings or for additional
information, and will promptly supply to the other party copies of all
correspondence between such party or its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the
Transaction SEC Filings or the Transactions. Each of Jefferies and Leucadia
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve all SEC comments with
respect to the Transaction SEC Filings and any other required filings as
promptly as practicable after receipt thereof. Each of Jefferies and Leucadia
agree to correct any information provided by it for use in the Transaction
SEC Filings that shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect. Each party will promptly notify the other party if at any time prior
to the Jefferies Meeting or Leucadia Meeting any event should occur that is
required by applicable Law to be set forth in an amendment of, or a supplement
to, the Transaction SEC Filings. In such case, the parties will cooperate to
promptly prepare and file such amendment or supplement with the SEC to the
extent required by applicable Law and will mail such amendment or supplement
to Jefferies stockholders and Leucadias stockholders to the extent required
by applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to such filing, each
party shall consult with each other party with respect to such amendment or
supplement and shall afford each such party and its Representatives reasonable
opportunity to comment thereon. Notwithstanding the forgoing, no party shall
have any obligation to notify the other parties of any matters to the extent
that its board of directors or any committee thereof determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that to do so would
be inconsistent with the directors exercise of their fiduciary obligations
to their respective stockholders under applicable Law.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Jefferies shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the DGCL and the Jefferies
Charter and Jefferies Bylaws to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a

Meeting if Jefferies determines in good faith that the delay, postponement or
adjournment of the Jefferies Meeting is necessary or appropriate in order to
obtain sufficient votes to obtain the Jefferies Stockholder Approval or is
required by the fiduciary duties of the Jefferies Board of

 



43  Directors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to relieve
Jefferies of its obligation to submit this Agreement to its stockholders for a
vote unless this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its
terms prior to the Jefferies Meeting.

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, Leucadia shall (i)
take all action necessary in accordance with the NYBCL and Leucadias

good faith that the delay, postponement or adjournment of the Leucadia Meeting
is necessary or appropriate in order to obtain sufficient votes to obtain the
Leucadia Stockholder Approval or is required by the fiduciary duties of the
Leucadia Board of Directors. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be
deemed to relieve Leucadia of its obligation to submit this Agreement to
its shareholders for a vote unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
in accordance with its terms prior to the Leucadia Meeting.

(d) Each of Jefferies and Leucadia shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause the Jefferies Meeting and the Leucadia Meeting to be held on

Section 5.5 _Governmental Approvals; Third Party Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, and
except where a different standard of effort is provided for in this
Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall use (and cause its Affiliates to
use) its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in accordance with,
applicable Law) to take promptly, or cause to be taken promptly, all actions,
and to do promptly, or cause to be done promptly, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Transactions,
including (i) preparing and filing, as promptly as practicable, all
applications, notices, petitions, filings and other requests necessary to
obtain all required waivers, consents and approvals, including the Jefferies
Approvals and the Leucadia Approvals, from Governmental Entities, (ii) to the
extent not prohibited by applicable Law, providing information to the other
regarding itself, its Affiliates and its and their respective businesses as
may be reasonably requested by the other party in connection with obtaining
such waivers, consents and approvals, (iii) responding as promptly as
practicable to any inquiries or requests received from any Governmental Entity
for additional information or documentation, (iv) determining which filings
are required to be made with, or consents, permits, authorizations, waivers
or approvals are required to be obtained from, any third parties or other
Governmental Entities in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions, (v) subject to applicable
legal limitations and the instructions of any Governmental Entity, keep each
other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by Jefferies or Leucadia, as the case may be,
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party or any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions and (vi) executing and
delivering any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, Jefferies and Leucadia shall (i) promptly, but in no event
later than ten days after the date of this Agreement, make their

 



44  respective filings and thereafter make any other required submissions under
the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law and (ii) use reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done,
all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make

States Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction or any other Person
may assert under Antitrust Law with respect to the Transactions, and to avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the End Date). Jefferies and Leucadia shall permit counsel for
the other party reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in
good faith the views of the other party in connection with, the non-
confidential provisions of any proposed written communication to any
Governmental Entity with respect thereto. Each of Jefferies and Leucadia
agrees not to (x) participate in any substantive meeting or
discussion, either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate, (y)
extend any waiting period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent
of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed) or (z) enter into any agreement with any Governmental Entity not
to consummate the Transactions without the prior written consent of the other
party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the agreements of the parties
contained in this _Section 5.5_, if any administrative or judicial Action,
including any Action by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging any of the Transaction as violative of any Antitrust
Law, each of Jefferies and Leucadia shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest and
resist any such Action and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any
decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section 5.5_ shall
limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(a)_ or _7.1(c)_ so long as such party has, prior to such termination,
complied with its obligations under this _Section 5.5_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none
of Leucadia, Jefferies, or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
obligated to agree, and none of Jefferies, Leucadia or any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall agree without the other partys prior written consent, to
take any action or accept any condition, restriction, obligation or
requirement with respect to Leucadia, Jefferies, their respective Subsidiaries
or Affiliates or their and their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
assets if such action, condition, restriction, obligation or requirements (i)
would reasonably be expected to require Leucadia, Jefferies or their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to sell, license, transfer, assign,
lease, dispose of or hold separate any material business or assets or (ii)
would reasonably be expected to result in any material limitations on
Leucadia or Jefferies or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to own,
retain, conduct or operate all or a material portion of their respective
businesses or assets.

 

(e) Except where a different standard of effort is provided for in this
Agreement, each of the parties shall use (and shall cause its Affiliates to
use) its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, approvals and
waivers from, and send all notices to, third parties that are required in
connection with the Transactions, and each of the parties agree to cooperate
with each other in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ that none of the
parties or any of their respective Affiliates shall be obligated to incur any
charge, expense or fee, defend or participate in any litigation or offer or
grant any accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any third party in
connection with any such consent, approval or waiver.

Section 5.6 _Takeover Statute_. If any "fair price", "moratorium", "control
share acquisition" or other form of antitakeover Law shall become applicable
to any of the Transactions, each party hereto and the members of their
respective boards of directors shall, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, grant such approvals and take

 



45  such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of
such statute or regulation on the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.7 _Public Announcements_. Except to the extent permitted under
_Section 5.3_ or otherwise related to a Jefferies Takeover Proposal or a
Leucadia Takeover Proposal, as applicable, Jefferies and Leucadia shall
consult with and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment upon any press release or other public statement or comment
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
prior to the issuance of such press release or other public statement or
comment, except that in the case of statements or comments as may be required
by applicable Law or by the rules or regulations of the SEC or any applicable
national securities exchange, each party will use its reasonable best efforts
to give the other party notice and an opportunity to review any required
filing. Leucadia and Jefferies agree to issue a joint press release announcing
this Agreement.

Section 5.8 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Leucadia, New Jefferies Surviving LLC and the Jefferies Converted LLC
shall honor all of Jefferies and its Subsidiaries obligations to indemnify
(and any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current and former
directors and officers of Jefferies and any of its Subsidiaries, as well as
any other employees who have executed individual indemnity agreements as set
forth on _Section 5.8(a)_ of the Jefferies Disclosure Schedule (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") for acts or omissions by such Indemnified Parties
occurring prior to the Second Effective Time, to the extent that such
obligations of Jefferies and such Subsidiaries exist on the date of this
Agreement, and such obligations shall survive the First Merger and the Second
Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms from the Second Effective Time until the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations with respect to any claims against such
Indemnified Parties arising out of such acts or omissions. The certificate of
formation and limited liability agreement of each of New Jefferies Surviving
LLC and the Jefferies Converted LLC shall contain provisions no less favorable
with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
former and present officers and directors than are set forth in the Jefferies
Charter and the Jefferies Bylaws, as of the date of this Agreement, which
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified, except as
required by applicable Law, for a period of six years from the Second
Effective Time, in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any such Indemnified Parties.

 

(b) Jefferies may obtain at or prior to the Second Effective Time, prepaid
(so-called " _tail_ ") directors and officers liability insurance policies
in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Second Effective
Time for six years from the Second Effective Time covering each Indemnified
Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the prior written consent of
Leucadia, Jefferies may not expend for any 12-month period therefor in excess
of 300% of the amount paid by Jefferies for coverage for the 12-month period
beginning on December 1, 2011. If Jefferies does not obtain "tail" insurance
as contemplated by the immediately preceding sentence, then, for a period of
six years from the Second Effective Time, Leucadia, New Surviving LLC and the
Jefferies Converted LLC shall cause to be maintained in effect the current
policies of directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance maintained by Jefferies and its Subsidiaries with respect
to matters arising before the Second Effective Time; _provided_ ,  _however_
, that the Jefferies Converted LLC may substitute therefor policies of a
reputable insurance company containing terms with respect to coverage and
amounts not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the consummation
of the Transaction and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable
by, each of the Indemnified Parties.

(d) If Leucadia, New Jefferies Surviving LLC, the Jefferies Converted LLC or
any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its

 



46  properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Leucadia, New
Jefferies Surviving LLC or the Jefferies Converted LLC, as the case may be,
shall assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

Section 5.9  _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Leucadia, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
Jefferies operations prior to the Second Effective Time. Prior to the Second
Effective Time, Jefferies shall exercise, consistent with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Jefferies, directly

implied representation or warranty with respect to Jefferies or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to any other information provided or
made available to Leucadia or Merger Sub Two in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in _Article IV_ , none of Leucadia, Merger Sub Two or
any other Person on behalf of Leucadia or Merger Sub Two makes any other

notice of issuance, as promptly as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, and in any event prior to the Second Effective Time.

cause, effective as of the Second Effective Time, (a) the board of directors
of Leucadia to consist of 14 members, eight of whom shall be current directors

the Second Merger from each qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning

Winery Business on the date hereof (provided that such spinout shall not
reduce the book value of Leucadia by more than $197,000,000) to Leucadias
stockholders to be effected without Leucadia retaining any material liability

such notification shall only be effective on the date specified in such notice
or five Business Days after the notice is given, whichever is later. Rejection

assigns.

 

Section 8.9 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction will, as to that jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without
rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this
Agreement and without rendering invalid or unenforceable any terms in
any other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to
be unenforceable, it is the parties intent that such provision will be
interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

 

Section 8.10 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the exhibits and schedules hereto) constitutes the entire
agreement, and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to

5.8_, which is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such Persons, is not intended to and shall not confer
upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights or
remedies hereunder. No representation, warranty, inducement, promise,
understanding or condition not set forth in this Agreement has been made or
relied upon by any of the parties hereto.

 

Section 8.11 _Amendments; Waivers_. At any time prior to the Second Effective

this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or
waiver is in writing and signed, in the case of an amendment, by Jefferies,
Leucadia, New Jefferies, Merger Sub One and Merger Sub Two, or in the case of
a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; _provided_
, _however_ , that after receipt of the Jefferies Stockholder Approval, if any
such

 



56  amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law or in accordance with the rules
and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange require further approval of the
stockholders of Jefferies, the effectiveness of such amendment or waiver will
be subject to the approval of the stockholders of Jefferies; _provided_
_further_ , _however_ , that after the receipt of the Leucadia Stockholder
Approval, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable law or in
accordance with the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange
require further approval by the stockholders of Leucadia, the effectiveness of
such amendment or waiver will be subject to the approval of the stockholders
of Leucadia. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by Jefferies
or Leucadia in exercising any right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof
nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or
further exercise of any other right hereunder.

Section 8.12 _Headings_. Headings of the Articles and Sections of this
Agreement are for convenience of the parties only and will be given no
substantive or interpretive effect whatsoever. The table of contents to this
Agreement is for reference purposes only and will not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

Section 8.13 _Confidentiality_.

(a) Jefferies and Leucadia shall, and each shall cause their respective
Representatives to, keep confidential any non-public information relating to
the other party (" _Confidential Information_ "), except to the extent that

made to the disclosing partys Representatives who need to know such

omissions of their respective Representatives which, if they were the acts or

hereunder.

 

(b) In the event that Jefferies or Leucadia or any of their respective
Representatives are requested or required by Law or other applicable judicial
or governmental order to disclose Confidential Information, the disclosing
party will provide the other party with prompt notice of any such request or
requirement so that the other party may seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy or waive compliance with the terms of this _Section
8.13_. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, or that such other party waives compliance with the terms hereof,
the disclosing party may disclose only that portion of the Confidential
Information that is legally required to be disclosed.

CERTIFICATE OF

AMENDMENT OF THE

 

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION

 

UNDER SECTION 805 OF THE BUSINESS CORPORATION LAW

Pursuant to the provisions of Section 805 of the Business Corporation Law, the
undersigned hereby certifies:



     | 1. | The name of the Corporation is Leucadia National Corporation
(the "Corporation"). The name under which the Corporation was formed is
Talcott National Corporation. 
---|---|--- 



     | 2. | The date the Certificate of Incorporation was filed by the
Department of State was May 24, 1968. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 3. | An amendment of the Corporations Certificate of
Incorporation effected by this Certificate of Amendment to require the
delivery of cash rather than capital stock of the Corporation to any target
shareholder in an acquisition transaction if any person would become a "five
percent shareholder" or be treated as owning more than 5% of the Corporations
Common Stock for purposes of Section 382 of the tax code as a result of such
target shareholders receipt of the Corporations capital stock in the
acquisition transaction. 
---|---|--- 

To effect the foregoing, Article FOURTH is hereby amended and shall read in
its entirety as follows:

FOURTH: The aggregate number of shares of capital stock of all classes which
the Corporation shall have authority to issue is 606,000,000, divided into
6,000,000 shares, having a par value of $1 each, which are designated
Preferred Stock and are issuable in series, and 600,000,000 shares, having a
par value of $1 each, which are designated Common Stock.

No holder of shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation,
whether now or hereafter authorized or outstanding, shall have any pre-
emptive, preferential or other right to subscribe for or purchase any shares
of any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, whether now or
hereafter authorized or outstanding, or any bonds, notes, obligations,
options, warrants, rights or other securities which the Corporation may at any
time issue or sell, whether or not the same be convertible into or
exercisable for the purchase of any class or series of capital stock of the
Corporation, it being intended by this paragraph that all pre-emptive rights
of any kind applicable to the securities of the Corporation are eliminated.

The designations, relative rights, preferences and limitations of each class
of the Corporations capital stock and each series thereof, to the extent
fixed in the Corporations Certificate of Incorporation, and the authority
vested in the Board of Directors of the Corporation to establish and designate
series of the Preferred Stock and to fix variations in the relative rights,
preferences and limitations between such series, are as follows:

 

I.

PREFERRED STOCK

GENERAL PROVISIONS RELATING TO ALL SERIES

1\. The Preferred Stock shall consist of one class, may be issued from time to
time in one or more series, and the shares of any one series thereof may be
issued from time to time. All shares of the Preferred Stock of the same
series shall be identical in all respects, except that shares of any one
series issued at different times may differ as to the dates, if any, from
which dividends thereon may accumulate. All shares of Preferred Stock of all
series shall be identical in all respects set forth in sections 1 through 5
hereof (except as otherwise permitted in  such sections) and shall be of equal rank as set forth in sections 2 and 3
below. Subject to the foregoing, (i) the designations, relative rights,
preferences and limitations of the shares of each such series may differ from
those of any and all other such series authorized and/or outstanding and (ii)
the Board of Directors of the Corporation is hereby expressly granted
authority to establish and designate series and to fix with respect to any
such series, or alter in any one or more respects from time to time, by
resolution or resolutions adopted prior to the issuance of any shares of such
series, and by filing a certificate under Section 805 of the
Business Corporation Law, (a) the number of shares constituting such series
and the designation thereof, (b) the rate of dividends, (c) redemption terms
(including purchase and sinking funds provisions), (d) conversion rights into
any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation, (e) liquidation
preferences, (f) voting rights and (g) any other lawful rights, preferences
and limitations.

 

2\. Unless otherwise provided in the resolutions creating or altering a
series, the holders of Preferred Stock of each series shall be entitled to
receive, as and when declared by the Board of Directors, out of funds or other
assets of the Corporation legally available therefor, cumulative dividends at
the annual rate fixed by the Board of Directors with respect to such series,
and no more, payable in cash, on such dates in each year as the Board of
Directors may determine, such dividends with respect to each series to be
cumulative from the date or dates fixed by the Board of Directors with respect
to such series. The first dividend or distribution with respect to shares of
any particular series not issued on a dividend date may be fixed by the Board
of Directors at more or less than the regular periodic dividend or
distribution thereon. In the event Preferred Stock of more than one series is
outstanding, the Corporation in making any dividend payment upon Preferred
Stock shall make dividend payments ratably upon all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock of all series in proportion to the respective amounts
of dividends accrued and payable thereon to the date of such dividend
payment. If the dividends or distributions on any shares of Preferred Stock
shall be in arrears, the holders thereof shall not be entitled to any
interest, or sum of money in lieu of interest, thereon. In no event, so long
as any Preferred Stock shall be outstanding, shall any dividend whatsoever,
whether in cash, stock or otherwise, other than a dividend payable in stock of
the Corporation of a class junior to the Preferred Stock, be declared or
paid, or any distribution made, on any stock of the Corporation of a class
ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, nor shall any shares of any such junior
class of stock be purchased or acquired for a consideration by
the Corporation or be redeemed by the Corporation, nor shall any moneys be
paid to the holders of, or set aside or made available for a sinking fund for
the purchase or redemption of, any shares of any such junior class of stock
unless (i) all dividends and distributions on all outstanding shares of
Preferred Stock of all series for all past dividend periods shall have been
paid and all dividends payable on or before the date of such dividend,
distribution, purchase, acquisition, redemption, setting aside or making
available shall have been paid or declared and a sum sufficient for the
payment thereof set apart, and (ii) the Corporation shall have paid or set
aside all amounts, if any, theretofore required to be paid or set aside as
and for all matured purchase fund and sinking fund obligations, if any, for
the shares of Preferred Stock of all series or to satisfy any distributions
declared with respect to any shares of Preferred Stock of any series. The
holders of Preferred Stock shall not be entitled to participate in any
dividends payable on junior stock or to share in the earnings or profits of
the Corporation other than or in excess of that hereinabove provided.

 

3\. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation or winding-up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, the holders of each series of
Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive, before any distribution or
payment is made upon any stock ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, such
amount of cash, shares, bonds or other property (which amount may vary
depending on whether such dissolution, liquidation or winding-up is voluntary
or involuntary) to which each such outstanding series of Preferred Stock shall
be entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof together with an amount
in cash equal to all dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the date of such
distribution or payment, and shall be entitled to no further payment. If, upon
any such liquidation, dissolution or winding-up, the assets of the Corporation
distributable among the holders of the Preferred Stock shall be insufficient
to permit the payment in full to such holders of the amounts to which they are
respectively entitled, the assets so distributable shall be distributed among
the holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding ratably in proportion to
the amounts to which they are respectively entitled. For the purposes of this
Section 3, neither the voluntary sale, lease, exchange or transfer of all or
substantially all of the 

 



2  Corporations property or assets to, nor the consolidation or merger of the
Corporation with, one or more corporations, nor a reduction of the capital
stock or stated capital of the Corporation, shall be deemed to be a
dissolution, liquidation or winding-up, voluntary or involuntary.

4\. The Corporation, at the option of the Board of Directors, may, subject to
the provisions applicable to such series, redeem at any time or times, and
from time to time, all or any part of the shares of any series of Preferred
Stock subject to redemption by paying for each share such price or prices as
shall have been fixed by the Board of Directors prior to the issuance of such
series, plus an amount equal to dividends accrued and unpaid thereon to the
date fixed for redemption, plus premiums in the amounts, if any, so fixed
with respect to such series (the total amount per share so payable upon any
redemption of shares of any series of Preferred Stock being herein referred to
as the "redemption price"). Except as otherwise provided in the provisions
relating to a particular series of Preferred Stock, not less than 15 days nor
more than 60 days prior written notice shall be given to the holders of record
of the shares so to be redeemed, which notice shall be given by mail,
postage prepaid, addressed to such holders at their respective addresses as
shown on the books of the Corporation. Such notice shall specify the shares
called for redemption, the redemption price and the place at which, and the
date on which, the shares called for redemption will, upon presentation and
surrender of the stock certificates evidencing such shares, be redeemed. In
case of redemption of less than all of the outstanding Preferred Stock of any
one series, such redemption (unless otherwise stated in the provisions
relating to such series) may be made pro rata or the shares to be redeemed may
be chosen by lot, in such manner as the Board of Directors may determine. No
failure to deliver or mail such notice nor any defect therein or in the
mailing thereof shall affect the validity of the proceedings for the
redemption of any shares so to be redeemed.

If such notice of redemption shall have been duly given, and if on or before
the redemption date specified in such notice all funds necessary for such
redemption shall have been set aside so as to be available therefor, then,
notwithstanding that any certificate for the shares of such Preferred Stock
so called for redemption shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the
shares represented thereby shall, from and after the date fixed for
redemption, no longer be deemed outstanding, the right to receive dividends
thereon shall cease to accrue from and after the date of redemption so fixed,
and all rights with respect to such shares of Preferred Stock so called for
redemption shall forthwith at the close of business on such redemption date
cease and terminate, except the right of the holders thereof to receive the
amount payable upon redemption thereof, but without interest; provided,
however, that the Corporation may, after giving such notice of any such
redemption and prior to the redemption date specified in such notice, deposit
in trust, for the account of the holders of such Preferred Stock to be
redeemed, with a bank or trust company having an office in the Borough of
Manhattan, City, County and State of New York and having a capital, undivided
profits and surplus aggregating at least $50,000,000, all funds necessary for
such redemption, and, upon such deposit in trust, all shares of such Preferred
Stock with respect to which such deposit shall have been made shall no longer
be deemed to be outstanding, and all rights with respect to such shares of
such Preferred Stock shall forthwith cease and terminate, except (a) the right
of the holders thereof to receive the amount payable upon the redemption
thereof, but without interest, and (b) the right of the holders thereof to
exercise on or before the date fixed for redemption the rights, if any, not
having theretofore expired, which the holders thereof shall have to convert
the shares so called for redemption into, or exchange such shares for, shares
of stock of any other class or classes or of any other series of the same or
any other class or classes of stock of the Corporation.

 

Any funds so deposited which shall not be required for such redemption because
of the exercise of any right of conversion or exchange or otherwise
subsequent to the date of such deposit shall be returned to the Corporation
forthwith. Any interest accrued on any funds so deposited shall belong to the
Corporation and be paid to it from time to time. Any funds so deposited by
the Corporation and unclaimed at the end of six years from the date fixed for
such redemption shall be repaid to the Corporation, upon its request, after
which repayment the holders of such shares so called for redemption shall look
only to the Corporation for the payment of the redemption price thereof.

If at any time the Corporation shall have failed to pay dividends in full on
all series of Preferred Stock then outstanding, thereafter and until such
dividends, including all accrued and unpaid dividends, shall have been paid

 



3  in full, or declared and funds sufficient for the payment thereof set aside
for payment, the Corporation shall not redeem or purchase less than all of the
Preferred Stock at such time outstanding; provided, however, that nothing
shall prevent the Corporation from completing the purchase of shares of
Preferred Stock for which a purchase contract has been entered into, or the
redemption of any shares of Preferred Stock for which notice of redemption
has been given, prior to such default.

5\. Except as otherwise specifically provided with respect to a particular
series of Preferred Stock, as hereinafter in this section 5 provided, and as
required by law, the Preferred Stock shall have no voting rights.

Whenever dividends payable on the Preferred Stock shall be in default in an
aggregate amount equivalent to at least six quarterly dividends on any of the
shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding, the number of directors
constituting the Board of Directors of the Corporation shall be increased by
two, and the holders of the Preferred Stock, voting as a class (whether or not
otherwise entitled to vote for the election of directors), shall be entitled
to elect two directors of the Corporation to fill such newly-created
directorships. Such directors shall serve (subject to the last sentence of the
next paragraph of this section 5) until the next annual meeting of
shareholders and until their successors are elected and qualify. Whenever
such right of the holders of the Preferred Stock shall have vested, such right
may be exercised initially either at a special meeting of such holders called
as provided herein, or at any annual meeting of shareholders, and thereafter
at annual meetings of shareholders. The right of the holders of the Preferred
Stock, voting as a class, to elect members of the Board of Directors of the
Corporation as aforesaid shall continue until such time as the dividends
accumulated on the Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, at which time
the special right of the holders of the Preferred Stock so to vote separately
as a class for the election of directors shall terminate, subject to renewal
and divestment from time to time upon the same terms and conditions.

At any time after the voting power to elect two additional members of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation has become vested in the holders of the
Preferred Stock, the Secretary of the Corporation may, and upon the request of
the holders of record of at least 5% of the Preferred Stock then outstanding
addressed to him, shall, call a special meeting of the holders of Preferred
Stock for the purpose of electing such directors, to be held within 50 days
after the receipt of such request; provided, however, that the Secretary need
not call any such special meeting if the annual meeting of shareholders is to
convene within 90 days after the receipt by the Secretary of such request.
Such meeting shall be held at such place as shall be specified in the notice
and upon notice as provided in the By-Laws of the Corporation for the holding
of special meetings of shareholders. If such meeting shall not be so called
within 20 days after the receipt of such request (not including, however, a
request falling within the proviso of the second preceding sentence), then
the holders of record of at least 5% of the Preferred Stock then outstanding
may designate in writing one of their number to call such meeting, and the
person so designated shall call such meeting at the place and upon the notice
above provided, and for that purpose shall have access to the stock books of
the Corporation. At any such special or annual meeting at which the holders of
the Preferred Stock shall have the right to vote for the election of such two
directors as aforesaid, the holders of 33 1/3% of the then outstanding
Preferred Stock present in person or represented by proxy shall be sufficient
to constitute a quorum of said class for the election of such two directors
and for no other purpose, and the vote of the holders of a plurality of the
Preferred Stock so present at any such meeting at which there shall be such a
quorum shall be sufficient to elect two directors. Whenever the holders of the
Preferred Stock shall be divested of such voting right hereinabove provided,
the directors so elected by the Preferred Stock shall thereupon cease to be
directors of the Corporation and thereupon the number of directors shall be
reduced by two.

 

Every shareholder entitled to vote at any particular time in accordance with
the foregoing two paragraphs shall have one vote for each share of Preferred
Stock held of record by him and entitled to vote.

6\. As used in connection with any series of Preferred Stock, the terms
"junior stock", "junior class of stock" and "stock ranking junior to the
Preferred Stock" shall mean and refer to the Common Stock and any other class
or series of stock of the Corporation hereafter authorized which shall rank
junior to the Preferred Stock with respect to the declaration and payment of
dividends thereon and the distribution of amounts with respect thereto payable
in the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
the Corporation.

 



4 II.

COMMON STOCK

Subject to all of the rights of the Preferred Stock, dividends may be paid
upon the Common Stock as and when declared by the Board of Directors out of
funds and other assets legally available for the payment of dividends. The
Board of Directors may declare a dividend or distribution upon the Common
Stock in shares of any class or series of capital stock of the Company.

In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or other winding-up of the
Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary, and after the holders of the
Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full the amounts to which they
respectively shall be entitled, or an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate
amount to which such holders shall be entitled shall have been deposited in
trust with a bank or trust company having its principal office in the Borough
of Manhattan, City, County and State of New York, having a capital, undivided
profits and surplus aggregating at least $50,000,000, for the benefit of the
holders of the Preferred Stock, the remaining net assets of the Corporation
shall be distributed pro rata to the holders of the Common Stock.

 

Except as otherwise expressly provided with respect to the Preferred Stock and
except as otherwise may be required by law, the Common Stock shall have the
exclusive right to vote for the election of directors and for all other
purposes and each holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to one vote for
each share held.

"Person" means an individual, corporation, estate, trust, association,

"Prohibited Distributions" means any dividends or other distributions that
were received from the Corporation by a Purported Transferee or Purported
Holder with respect to Excess Securities.

 

"Prohibited Transfer" means any purported Transfer of Corporation Securities
to the extent that such Transfer is prohibited and void under this Part III
of Article FOURTH.

 



5 "Restriction Release Date" means the earlier of December 31, 2024, the
repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Code") (and any comparable successor provision) ("Section 382"), or the

include the creation or grant of an option (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulation ss.1.382-2T(h)(4)(v)). A Transfer shall not include an issuance or

"Treasury Regulation ss.1.382-2T" means the temporary income tax regulations
promulgated under Section 382, and any successor regulations. References to
any subsection of such regulations include references to any successor
subsection thereof.

(b) Restrictions.

(i) Any attempted Transfer of Corporation Securities prior to the Restriction
Release Date, or any attempted Transfer of Corporation Securities pursuant to
an agreement entered into prior to the Restriction Release Date, shall be
prohibited and void _ab initio_ to the extent that, as a result of
such Transfer (or any series of Transfers of which such Transfer is a part),
either (1) any Person or group of Persons shall become a Five-Percent
Shareholder, or (2) the Percentage Stock Ownership interest in the Corporation
of any Five-Percent Shareholder shall be increased; provided, however, that
nothing herein contained shall preclude the settlement of any transaction
entered into through the facilities of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. in
the Corporation Securities. 

(ii) If, as a result of an Acquisition Issuance prior to the Restriction
Release Date, any Person or group of Persons would become a Five-Percent
Shareholder, then, notwithstanding anything in the agreement governing the
terms of the relevant acquisition to the contrary, the Corporation shall not
deliver to the Person that would otherwise be entitled to receive
the Corporation Securities in such Acquisition Issuance (the "Purported
Holder") the minimum number of Corporation Securities otherwise deliverable in
the Acquisition Issuance such that such Person or group of Persons shall not
become a Five-Percent Shareholder ("Excess Issued Securities"). Any and all
such Excess Issued Securities shall instead be delivered to the Agent for sale
in accordance with paragraph (d)(ii) of this Article FOURTH. Any attempted or
purported delivery of Excess Issued Securities in violation of this clause
(ii) shall be void _ab initio_.

(c) Certain Exceptions. The restrictions set forth in paragraph (b) of this
Part III of Article FOURTH shall not apply to (1) an attempted Transfer if the
transferor or the transferee obtains, or (2) a delivery of Excess Issued
Securities if the Purported Holder or the Corporation obtains, the approval
of the Board of Directors of the Corporation. Any such approval must expressly
waive the applicability of the restrictions set forth in this Part III of
Article FOURTH. As a condition to granting its approval, the Board of
Directors may, in its discretion, require an opinion of counsel selected by
the Board of Directors that the Transfer or delivery of Excess Issued
Securities shall not result in the application of any Section 382 limitation
on the use of the Tax Benefits.

(d) Treatment of Excess Transferred Securities and Excess Issued Securities.

(i) No employee or agent of the Corporation shall record any delivery of
Excess Issued Securities to a Purported Holder or any Prohibited Transfer,
and the Purported Holder and the purported transferee of such a Prohibited
Transfer (the "Purported Transferee") shall not be recognized as a shareholder
of the Corporation for any purpose whatsoever in respect of the Excess Issued
Securities or the Corporation Securities which are the subject of the
Prohibited Transfer (the "Excess Transferred Securities", and together with
the Excess Issued 

 



6  Securities, the "Excess Securities"). The Purported Transferee and the
Purported Holder shall not be entitled with respect to such Excess Securities
to any rights of shareholders of the Corporation, including without
limitation, the right to vote such Excess Securities and to receive dividends
or distributions, whether liquidating or otherwise, in respect thereof, if
any. Once the Excess Securities have been acquired in a Transfer that is not
a Prohibited Transfer, the Corporation Securities shall cease to be Excess
Securities.

(ii) If the Board of Directors determines that a Transfer of Corporation
Securities constitutes a Prohibited Transfer or that Excess Issued Securities
have been delivered to a Purported Holder, then, upon written demand by the
Corporation, the Purported Transferee or Purported Holder shall transfer or
cause to be transferred any certificate or other evidence of ownership of the
Excess Securities within the Purported Transferees or Purported Holders
possession or control, together with any Prohibited Distributions, to an
agent designated by the Board of Directors (the "Agent"). The Agent shall
promptly sell to a buyer or buyers, which may include the Corporation, the
Excess Securities transferred to it pursuant to the preceding sentence or
paragraph (b)(ii) of this Article FOURTH, in one or more arms-length
transactions (over the New York Stock Exchange, if possible); provided,
however, that the Agent shall effect such sale or sales in an orderly fashion
and shall not be required to effect any such sale within any specific time
frame if, in the Agents discretion, such sale or sales would disrupt the
market for the Corporation Securities or otherwise would adversely affect the
value of the Corporation Securities. If the Purported Transferee or Purported
Holder has sold the Excess Securities before receiving the Corporations
demand to surrender the Excess Securities to the Agent, the Purported
Transferee or Purported Holder shall be deemed to have sold the Excess
Securities on behalf of the Agent, and shall be required to transfer to the
Agent any Prohibited Distributions and the proceeds of such sale, except to
the extent that the Agent grants written permission to the
Purported Transferee or Purported Holder to retain a portion of such
Prohibited Distributions or sales proceeds not exceeding the amount that the
Purported Transferee or Purported Holder would have received from the Agent
pursuant to paragraph (d)(iii) of this Article FOURTH if the Agent rather
than the Purported Transferee or Purported Holder had sold the Excess
Securities.

 

(iii) The Agent shall apply any proceeds of a sale by it of Excess Securities,
and any amounts received by the Agent from a Purported Transferee or
Purported Holder pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of this Article FOURTH, as
follows: (1) first, in the case of Excess Transferred Securities, such amounts
shall be paid to the Agent to the extent necessary to cover its costs
and expenses incurred in connection with its duties hereunder; (2) second,
any remaining amounts shall be paid to the Purported Transferee or Purported
Holder, up to either (i) the amount paid by the Purported Transferee for the
Excess Securities, or (ii) the fair market value, calculated on the basis of
the closing market price for Corporation Securities on the day before the
Acquisition Issuance or attempted Transfer, of the Excess Securities at the
time of the Acquisition Issuance or attempted Transfer to the Purported
Transferee by gift, inheritance, or similar Transfer, which amount or fair
market value shall be determined in the discretion of the Board of Directors;
and (3) third, any remaining amounts, subject to the limitations imposed by
the following proviso, shall be paid to the Leucadia Foundation; provided,
however, that (x) if the Leucadia Foundation shall have terminated prior to
its receipt of such amounts, such remaining amounts shall be paid to one or
more organizations qualifying under Section 501(c)(3) of the Code (and any
comparable successor provision) ("Section 501(c)(3)") selected by the Board of
Directors, and (y) to the extent that the receipt of such amounts could
result in the Leucadia Foundation or any other organization qualifying under
Section 501(c)(3) becoming a Five-Percent Shareholder, then such remaining
amounts may be paid to one or more other organizations qualifying under
Section 501(c)(3) selected by the Board of Directors. The recourse of any
Purported Transferee or Purported Holder in respect of any Prohibited Transfer
or delivery of Excess Issued Securities shall be limited to the amount payable
to the Purported Transferee or Purported Holder pursuant to clause (2) of the
preceding sentence. In no event shall the proceeds of any sale of Excess
Securities pursuant to this Part III of Article FOURTH inure to the benefit of
the Corporation. 

(iv) If the Purported Transferee or Purported Holder fails to surrender the
Excess Securities or the proceeds of a sale thereof to the Agent within
thirty business days from the date on which the Corporation makes a demand
pursuant to paragraph (d)(ii) of this Article, then the Corporation shall
institute legal proceedings to compel the surrender.

 



7 (v) The Corporation shall make the demand described in paragraph (d)(ii) of
this Part III of Article FOURTH within thirty days of the date on which the
Board of Directors determines that the attempted Transfer would result in
Excess Transferred Securities or that a Purported Holder received Excess
Issued Securities; provided, however, that if the Corporation makes such
demand at a later date, the provisions of this Part III of Article FOURTH
shall apply nonetheless.

(e) Bylaws, Legends, etc.

(i) The Bylaws of the Corporation shall make appropriate provisions to
effectuate the requirements of this Part III of Article FOURTH.

(ii) All certificates representing Corporation Securities issued after the
effectiveness of this Part III of Article FOURTH shall bear a conspicuous
legend as follows:

THE TRANSFER OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS
PURSUANT TO PART III OF ARTICLE FOURTH OF THE CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF
LEUCADIA NATIONAL CORPORATION REPRINTED IN ITS ENTIRETY ON THE BACK OF THIS
CERTIFICATE.

(iii) The Board of Directors of the Corporation shall have the power to
determine all matters necessary to determine compliance with this Part III of
Article FOURTH, including without limitation (1) whether a new Five-Percent
Shareholder would be required to be identified in certain circumstances, (2)
whether a Transfer is a Prohibited Transfer, (3) the Percentage Stock
Ownership in the Corporation of any Five-Percent Shareholder, (4) whether an
instrument constitutes a Corporation Security, (5) the amount or fair market
value due to a Purported Transferee or Purported Holder pursuant to clause
(2) of paragraph (d)(iii) of this Part III of Article FOURTH, (6) whether an
issuance of Corporation Securities is an Acquisition Issuance, (7) the number
of Excess Issued Securities with respect to any Purported Holder, and (8) any
other matters which the Board of Directors determines to be relevant; and the
good faith determination of the Board of Directors on such matters shall be
conclusive and binding for all the purposes of this Part III of Article
FOURTH.
