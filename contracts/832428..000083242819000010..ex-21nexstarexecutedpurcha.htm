unknown, not expressly assumed by Buyer under Section 2.3(a) (herein referred
to as "Excluded Liabilities") and, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 2.3(a), none
of the following shall be "Assumed Liabilities" for purposes of this
Agreement:



(i) (A) all Taxes (other than any Prorated Taxes or Transfer Taxes) of Seller,
Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, for any Tax
period,

(B) any Prorated Taxes for the portion of any Straddle Period prior to the
Closing Date (determined in accordance with Section 6.1), and (C) any Transfer

(ii) other than as set forth in Section 6.2, any of the liabilities or
obligations under the benefit or compensation agreements, plans or
arrangements sponsored or maintained by Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Affiliates (including, without limitation, all Employee Plans);



(iii) any intercompany payables of the Business owing to Seller, Tribune or
any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable;



(iv) any liabilities or obligations of Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, under this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or the Seller Ancillary Agreements (except as set forth in Section
6.2(c));



(v) any liabilities or obligations, including forfeiture expenses, arising
from any complaints with the FCC in respect of events that occurred prior to
the Closing; and



(vi) all liabilities and obligations arising with, or relating to, the
operation of the Stations, including the owning or holding of the Purchased

Section 2.4. Closing Date. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, if all
of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than the condition set forth
in Section 7.1(c)) are satisfied or, if legally permissible, waived (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied (or validly
waived) at the Closing, but subject to such satisfaction or waiver) as of the
Merger Closing Date, the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets provided
for in Section 2.1 (the "Closing") shall take place at 10:00 a.m., Eastern
Time, on the Merger Closing Date, substantially concurrently with the
consummation of the Merger, at the offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601
Lexington Avenue, New York, New York 10022; provided, that if all of the
conditions set forth in Article VII are not satisfied or, if legally
permissible, waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied (or validly waived) at the Closing, but subject to such
satisfaction or waiver) as of the Merger Closing Date, then the Closing shall
be consummated on the date that is two (2) Business Days following the
satisfaction or, to the extent legally permissible, waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII, or such other time as may be determined by mutual
agreement of Seller and Buyer; provided further, that if the Marketing Period
has not ended on the last date the Closing shall be required to occur pursuant to the foregoing,
the Closing shall occur instead on the earlier of (a) the second (2nd)
Business Day immediately following the day that the Marketing Period expires
and (b) any Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by
Buyer on no less than three (3) Business Days' prior written notice to Seller.
The date on which the Closing occurs in accordance with this Section 2.4 shall
be referred to herein as the "Closing Date".





Section 2.5. Purchase Price. The purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the
"Purchase Price") shall be equal to Five Hundred Eighty Million Dollars
($580,000,000), subject to adjustment as provided in this Agreement. Buyer
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Purchase Price at the Closing by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the account or account(s)
designated by Seller.



Section 2.6. Proration and Adjustments.



(a)The Purchase Price shall be (i) decreased by the aggregate amount of all
Assumed Capital Lease Obligations as of the Cutoff Time and (ii) increased or
decreased, as applicable, by the net amount due to Buyer or Seller, as
applicable, pursuant to the prorations to be made pursuant to Section 2.6(b).
The prorations and adjustments to be made pursuant to this Section 2.6 are
referred to herein as the "Closing Date Adjustments."



(b)All income and expenses arising from the Business, including, without
limitation, Assumed Liabilities and prepaid expenses, Prorated Taxes (but
excluding accounts receivable of Seller, Tribune or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, as applicable), annual regulatory fees payable to the FCC, power
and utilities charges, and rents and similar prepaid and deferred items shall
be prorated between Seller and Buyer in accordance with GAAP to reflect the
principle that Seller (on behalf of itself and Tribune) shall be entitled to
all income and be responsible for all expenses arising from the Business
through the Cutoff Time and Buyer shall be entitled to all income and be
responsible for all expenses arising from the Business after the Cutoff Time.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.6 to the contrary, (i) except as
set forth herein, with respect to Trade Agreements for the sale of time for
goods or services assumed by Buyer, if at the Cutoff Time, the Trade
Agreements have an aggregate negative balance (i.e., the amount by which the
value of air time the Stations are obligated to provide after the Cutoff Time
exceeds the fair market value of corresponding goods and services to be
received by the Stations after such date), there shall be no proration or
adjustment, unless the aggregate negative balance of the Stations' Trade
Agreements exceeds $100,000, in which event only such excess shall be treated
as prepaid time sales of the Stations, and adjusted for as a proration in
Buyer's favor, (ii) there shall be no proration under this Section 2.6 to the
extent there is an aggregate positive balance with respect to the Stations'
Trade Agreements, (iii) there shall be no proration under this Section 2.6 for
Program Rights agreements except to the extent that any payments or
performance due under such Program Rights agreements relate to a payment
period that straddles the Cutoff Time, in which case the amount payable in the
payment period will be prorated based on the number of days in such period and
(iv) there shall be no proration for the obligations of Buyer set forth in
Section 6.2(c) of this Agreement.



(c)At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
estimate all Closing Date Adjustments pursuant to this Section 2.6 and shall
deliver a statement of its estimates to Buyer (which statement shall set forth
in reasonable detail the basis for those estimates). At the Closing, the net
amount due to Buyer or Seller, as applicable, as a result of the estimated
Closing Date Adjustments shall be applied as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to
Seller a statement of any adjustments to Seller's estimate of the Closing Date
Adjustments, and no later than the close of business on the thirtieth (30th)
day after the delivery of such statement (the "Payment Date"), Buyer shall pay to Seller, or Seller shall pay to Buyer, as
the case may be, any amount due as a result of the adjustment (or, if there is
any good faith dispute, the undisputed amount). Except with respect to items
that Seller notifies Buyer that it objects to prior to the close of business
on the date that is at least one (1) Business Day prior to the Payment Date,
the adjustments set forth in Buyer's statement shall be final and binding on
the parties effective at the close of business on the Payment Date. If Seller
disputes Buyer's determinations or Buyer disputes Seller's determinations, the
parties shall consult with regard to the matter and an appropriate adjustment
and payment shall be made as agreed upon in writing by the parties within
thirty (30) days after the Payment Date. If such thirty (30) day period
expires, and the dispute has not been resolved, then the parties shall select
BDO USA, LLP or, if such firm is unable to serve in such capacity, a mutually
acceptable, nationally recognized independent accounting firm that does not
then have a relationship with Seller or Buyer (the "Independent Accountant"),
to resolve the disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto as
promptly as practicable. The determination by the Independent Accountant on
the matter shall be binding. If an Independent Accountant is engaged pursuant
to this Section 2.6, the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall
be borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as such parties may prevail
on the resolution of the disagreement, which proportionate allocation also
will be determined by the Independent Accountant and be included in the
Independent Accountant's written report, and an appropriate adjustment and
payment shall be made within three (3) Business Days of the resolution by the
Independent Accountant, and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to
cause such resolution to be rendered within thirty (30) days after such
submission.



Section 2.7. Closing Date Deliveries.



(a)At the Closing, Seller shall deliver, or cause Tribune to deliver, as
applicable, to Buyer (i) duly executed counterparts of a bill of sale and
assignment and assumption agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit A
(the "Bill of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement"), providing for
the conveyance of all of the Purchased Assets (other than the Owned Real
Property and the Station Licenses) and the assumption of all of the Assumed
Liabilities, (ii) an assignment of the Station Licenses from Seller or
Tribune, as applicable, substantially in the form of Exhibit B (the
"Assignment of Station Licenses"), assigning to Buyer the Station Licenses and
all other assignable Governmental Authorizations issued by the FCC primarily
related to the Stations, (iii) duly executed counterparts of a transition
services agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit C (the "Transition
Services Agreement"), (iv) special or limited warranty deeds (in the customary
form for such jurisdiction) conveying to Buyer the Owned Real Property, (v)
all of the documents and instruments required to be delivered by Seller
pursuant to Article VII, (vi) specific assignment and assumption agreements
duly executed by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, relating to any agreements
included as Purchased Assets that Buyer or Seller have determined to be
reasonably necessary to assign such agreements to Buyer and for Buyer to
assume the Assumed Liabilities thereunder, (vii) a duly executed certificate
of non- foreign status that meets the requirements set forth in Treasury
Regulations Section 1.1445- 2(b)(2), (viii) a duly executed counterpart of the
Option Agreement, substantially in the form of Exhibit D (the "Option
Agreement"), and (ix) such other documents and instruments as are reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



(b)At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller (i) the Purchase Price in
accordance with Section 2.5, (ii) duly executed counterparts to (A) the Bill
of Sale and Assignment and Assumption Agreement and (B) the Transition
Services Agreement, (iii) all of the documents and instruments required to be
delivered by Buyer pursuant to Article VII, (iv) specific assignment and
assumption agreements duly executed by Buyer relating to any agreements
included as Purchased Assets that Buyer or Seller have determined to be
reasonably necessary to assign such agreements to Buyer or for Buyer to assume
the Assumed Liabilities thereunder, (v) a duly executed counterpart of the
Option Agreement, and (vi) such other documents and instruments as are reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.



Section 2.8. Further Assurances.



(a)From time to time following the Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, to Buyer such other instruments of
conveyance and transfer as Buyer may reasonably request or as may otherwise be
necessary to effectively convey and transfer to, and vest in, Buyer, and put
Buyer in possession of, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets.



(b)Without limiting Section 5.2(g), to the extent that any Station Agreement
or other Contract included as a Purchased Asset cannot be assigned without
consent and such consent is not obtained prior to the Closing, (i) this
Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same if an attempted
assignment would constitute a breach thereof, (ii) Seller shall use reasonable
best efforts to provide to Buyer the benefits of any such Contract, (iii) to
the extent that Buyer actually receives the benefits of any such Contract,
Buyer shall perform or discharge on behalf of Seller all obligations and
liabilities under such Contract that would constitute Assumed Liabilities if
such Contract were effectively assigned to Buyer and (iv) Seller and Buyer
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent (provided that Seller, Buyer and
their respective Affiliates shall not have any obligation to offer or pay any
consideration in order to obtain any such consent, nor shall Buyer have any
obligation to amend, modify or otherwise alter the terms of any such
Contract). In addition to Buyer's obligations pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, as to any Station Agreement or other Contract included as a
Purchased Asset that is not effectively assigned to Buyer as of the Closing
Date but is thereafter effectively assigned to Buyer, Buyer shall, from and
after the effective date of such assignment, assume, and shall thereafter pay,
perform and discharge as and when due, all Assumed Liabilities of Seller,
Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries arising under such Contract in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.



(c)From time to time following the Closing, Buyer shall execute and deliver,
or cause to be executed and delivered, to Seller such other undertakings and
assumptions as Seller may reasonably request or as may be otherwise necessary
to effectively evidence Buyer's assumption of and obligation to pay, perform
and discharge the Assumed Liabilities.



(d)Seller shall, and shall cause Tribune and their respective Affiliates to,
promptly pay or deliver (without right of set off) to Buyer (or its designated
Affiliates) any monies or checks in connection with, arising out of, or
relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities that
have been sent to Seller or Tribune or any of their respective Affiliates
after the Closing by customers, suppliers or other contracting parties of the
Business or the Purchased Assets to the extent such monies or checks are not
Excluded Assets. If, following the Closing, Buyer, Seller or Tribune becomes
aware that Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Affiliates owns or holds
any asset or right that constitutes a Purchased Asset but which has not been
transferred to Buyer in connection with the consummation of the transactions
hereunder, such party shall promptly inform the other party of that fact.
Thereafter, at the request of Buyer, Seller or Tribune shall execute, or cause
the relevant Affiliate of Seller or Tribune to execute, such documents as may
be reasonably necessary to cause the transfer of any such asset or right to
Buyer or any other entities designated by Buyer for no additional
consideration, and Buyer shall do all such things reasonably necessary to
facilitate such transfer.



(e)Buyer shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, promptly pay or
deliver (without right of set off) to Seller or Tribune or any of their
respective Affiliates any monies or checks to the extent they are not due to the Business or a Purchased Asset (or any other
business of Buyer or any of its Affiliates) or are in respect of an Excluded
Asset or Excluded Liability hereunder that have been sent to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates after the Closing by customers, suppliers or other contracting
parties of Seller or Tribune or any of their respective Affiliates. If,
following the Closing, Buyer, Seller or Tribune becomes aware that Buyer or
any of its Affiliates owns or holds any asset or right that is not a Purchased
Asset and that was owned by Seller or Tribune or any of their respective
Affiliates immediately prior to the Closing, such party shall promptly inform
the other party of that fact. Thereafter, at the request of Seller or Tribune,
Buyer shall execute, or cause the relevant Affiliate of Buyer to execute, such
documents as may be reasonably necessary to cause the transfer of any such
asset or right to Seller or Tribune or such other Person designated by Seller
or Tribune for no consideration, and Seller or Tribune shall do all such
things reasonably necessary to facilitate such transfer.





Section 2.9. Allocation of Purchase Price. Buyer and Seller agree that the
fair market value of the Purchased Assets will be appraised by
PricewaterhouseCoopers or another accounting or appraisal firm mutually agreed
upon by the parties (the "Appraisal"). All costs and expenses of the
accounting or appraisal firm in preparing the Appraisal shall be borne by
Buyer. Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of the Appraisal and an allocation
statement with its proposed allocations of the applicable portions of the
Purchase Price (and any other applicable amounts treated as consideration for
U.S. federal income tax purposes) in accordance with the Appraisal and Section
1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder (and any
similar provisions of state, local, or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate). From and
after the date hereof, Seller shall cooperate with the Buyer, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by Buyer, in connection with matters relating to
the Appraisal and such allocations. If Seller does not notify the Buyer prior
to the close of business on the date that is thirty (30) days after the date
of receipt by Seller of the Appraisal and such allocation statement that it
disputes any of Buyer's allocations, the allocations set forth in Buyer's
allocation statement shall be final and binding on the parties and the parties
shall complete and timely file any necessary Tax forms, and their respective
income Tax Returns, in accordance with such allocations. If Seller notifies
Buyer within such thirty (30) day period that it disputes any of Buyer's
allocations, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to finalize such
disputed allocation(s) no later than thirty (30) days after the date of
receipt by Buyer of such notice from Seller. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
agree on such allocation(s) within such thirty (30) day period, then the
parties shall hire and consult with the Independent Accountant to resolve the
disagreement and make a determination with respect thereto as promptly as
practicable. The determination by the Independent Accountant on the matter
shall be binding. If an Independent Accountant is engaged pursuant to this
Section 2.9, the fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by Seller and Buyer in inverse proportion as such parties may prevail on
the resolution of the disagreement which proportionate allocation also will be
determined by the Independent Accountant and be included in the Independent
Accountant's written report, and an appropriate adjustment and payment shall
be made within three (3) Business Days of the resolution by the Independent
Accountant, and the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such
resolution to be rendered within thirty (30) days after such submission (the
final allocation after resolution of all disputes, if any, is referred to
herein as, the "Final Allocation"). The parties shall file all applicable Tax
Returns consistent with such Final Allocation and not take any position
contrary thereto in such Tax Returns or otherwise. The parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to update the Final Allocation in accordance
with the allocation methodology utilized in this Section 2.9 following any
adjustment to the Purchase Price pursuant to this Agreement, and the parties
shall report consistently with such Final Allocation, as adjusted, on all Tax
Returns (or timely amend already filed Tax Returns to reflect such adjusted
Final Allocation) and not take any position contrary thereto in such Tax
Returns or otherwise, unless otherwise required pursuant to a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any similar provision of
applicable state, local or foreign Law). 



Section 2.10. Withholding. Buyer and its designees shall be entitled to
withhold and deduct from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as such Person is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law; provided, that, except with
respect to any withholding required as a result of Seller's failure to comply
with Section 2.7(a)(vii), Buyer shall, prior to such withholding on any
payment to Seller, provide written notice to Seller of its intent to withhold
and provide Seller with the reasonable opportunity to provide such forms or
other evidence as may reduce, eliminate or mitigate such withholding. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld in accordance with applicable Law, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding were
made.

all FCC regulatory fees due in respect of each Station and (iv) have completed
or caused to be completed the construction of all facilities or changes
contemplated by any of the Station Licenses or construction permits issued to

Schedule or as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

whether personal, real or mixed, wherever located, that are used or held for use by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, or any of their respective

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that: (A) nothing contained in this Agreement
shall give Buyer or any of its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, the right
to control or direct the operations of Seller or Tribune, as applicable, prior
to the Closing, (B) prior to the Closing, Seller or Tribune, as applicable, or

Stations and (C) notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, no consent of Buyer shall be required with respect to any matter
set forth in this Section 5.1 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the extent
that the requirement of such consent would violate any applicable Law.





Section 5.2. Efforts.



(a)As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days hereafter, Seller, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates, as applicable, shall file and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement) to cause Tribune to file, with the FCC the necessary FCC
Applications requesting its consent to the Assignment of the Station Licenses
as contemplated by this Agreement. Seller shall, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement) to cause Tribune to, and Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, cooperate in the preparation of such applications and will diligently
take, or cooperate in the taking of, all necessary, desirable and proper
steps, to provide any additional information required by the FCC and shall use
reasonable best efforts to obtain promptly the FCC Consent; provided, however,
that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Seller and Tribune and
their respective Affiliates may take various actions related to obtaining
necessary approvals for the Merger and to consummate the Merger, including,
amending the FCC Applications in a manner which may affect the timing of FCC
action with respect to the FCC Applications but that would not otherwise
adversely affect Buyer's interests in the transaction, and such actions shall
not be deemed a violation of this obligation. Seller, on the one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall bear the cost of FCC filing fees relating to
the FCC Applications equally. Buyer and Seller shall (including, in the case
of Seller, by using reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce
its rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to) oppose any
petitions to deny or other objections filed with respect to the FCC
Applications to the extent such petition or objection relates to any such
party. Neither Seller nor Buyer shall, and each shall cause its Affiliates not
to, take (and, in the case of Seller, shall use its reasonable best efforts
(including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to
prevent Tribune and its Affiliates from taking) any intentional action that
would, or intentionally fail to take such action the failure of which to take
would, reasonably be expected to have the effect of preventing or materially
delaying the receipt of the FCC Consent; provided, however, that the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that Seller and its Affiliates and Tribune may
take various actions related to obtaining necessary approvals for the Merger
and to consummate the Merger, including, amending the FCC Applications in a
manner which may affect the timing of FCC action with respect to the FCC
Applications but that would not otherwise adversely affect Buyer's interests
in the transaction, and such actions shall not be deemed a violation of this
obligation. The parties agree that they will cooperate to amend the FCC
Applications as may be necessary or required to obtain the timely grant of the
FCC Consent. As may reasonably be necessary to facilitate the grant of the FCC
Consent, in the event that in order to obtain the FCC Consent in an
expeditious manner, it is necessary for Buyer or any of its Affiliates to enter into a customary
assignment, assumption, tolling, or other similar arrangement with the FCC to
resolve any complaints with the FCC relating to the Stations, Buyer shall
enter, or cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to enter, into such a customary
assignment, assumption, tolling or other arrangement with the FCC. If the
Closing Date shall not have occurred for any reason within the original
effective period of the FCC Consent, and neither party hereto shall have
terminated this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, Seller and the Buyer shall
jointly request extensions of the effective period of the FCC Consent until
the Closing Date occurs or this Agreement is otherwise terminated; provided,
however, no such extension of the FCC Consent shall limit the right of either
party hereto to exercise such party's rights under Article IX.



(b)As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, but in any event no later
than ten (10) Business Days thereafter, to the extent required by applicable
Laws, Seller and Buyer shall file (and in the case of Seller, shall use its
reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the
Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune and its Affiliates to file), and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to file (if necessary), with the FTC and the
Antitrust Division of the DOJ any notifications and other information required
to be filed with such commission or department under the HSR Act, or any rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and shall request early termination of the
waiting period thereunder. Each of Seller and Buyer shall file (and in the
case of Seller, shall use its reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to
enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune and its
Affiliates to file), and shall cause their respective Affiliates to file, as
promptly as practicable such additional information as may be reasonably
requested to be filed by such commission or department. Buyer shall bear 100%
of the cost of any filing fees payable under the HSR Act in connection with
the notifications and information described in this Section 5.2(b).



(c)Subject to the terms and conditions herein, Seller shall, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the
Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to, and Buyer shall, use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, including by using reasonable
best efforts to (i) as applicable to Buyer or Seller, obtain and maintain all
necessary, proper or advisable consents, approvals, waivers and authorizations
of, actions or nonactions by, and making of all required filings, in
consultation with each other, of all documentation to effect all necessary,
proper or advisable filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents with any
Governmental Authority or any other Third Party required by such party in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
cooperate with each other in (A) determining which filings are necessary,
proper or advisable to be made prior to the Closing with, and which consents,
approvals, permits, notices or authorizations are required to be obtained
prior to the Closing from, Governmental Authorities or Third Parties in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and related
agreements, and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby and (B) timely making all necessary filings and timely seeking all
consents, approvals, permits, notices or authorizations; provided, however,
that the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that Seller or Tribune may take
such actions as are reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with
obtaining all necessary approvals for the Merger and to consummate the Merger,
including amending the FCC Applications (which may affect the matters referred
to in clause (ii) above), and such actions shall not be deemed a violation of
this obligation, provided that any amendment to the FCC Applications does not
adversely affect Buyer's interests in the transaction beyond affecting the
timing of FCC action with respect to the FCC Applications.

 (d)In furtherance of and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, (i) take promptly any and all
steps necessary to (x) obtain the DOJ Consent and approval of the transactions
by the FTC as required under the HSR Act and the DOJ Final Judgment and (y)
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any
Competition Laws or any communications or broadcast Laws (including the
Communications Act) that may be required by any U.S. federal, state or local
antitrust, competition or communications or broadcast Governmental Authority,
or by the FCC or similar Governmental Authority, in each case with competent
jurisdiction or by the DOJ Final Judgment, so as to enable the parties to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, (ii) vigorously contest (including by means of litigation) (x)
any actions, arbitrations, litigations, suits or other civil or criminal
proceedings brought, or threatened to be brought, by any Governmental
Authority or any other Person seeking to enjoin, restrain, prevent, prohibit
or make illegal the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or seeking damages or to impose any terms or conditions in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) any Order that enjoins,
restrains, prevents, prohibits or makes illegal the consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or imposes any damages, terms or conditions
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (iii) take any and
all actions necessary to resolve any objections any Governmental Authority may
assert under any applicable Law with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and to obtain any clearance required under the HSR Act, any
DOJ Final Judgment or the Communications Act or to resolve any objection by
any other Third Party relating to the obtaining of any consent, approval,
waiver or authorization required from such Third Party in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including agreeing to and making
divestitures, entering into hold separate arrangements, terminating, assigning
or modifying Contracts (or portions thereof) or other business relationships,
accepting restrictions on business operations and entering into commitments
and obligations). Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, take any and all actions necessary in order to
ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-action, consent or approval of the
FTC, the DOJ, any authority enforcing applicable Competition Laws or any
communications or broadcast Laws (including the Communications Act), any state
attorney general or other Governmental Authority, (y) no decree, judgment,
injunction, temporary restraining order or any other order in any suit or
proceeding, and (z) no other matter relating to any Competition Laws or any
communications or broadcast Laws (including the Communications Act) would
preclude consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
the Termination Date.



(e)Buyer understands that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the identity of Buyer, are subject to the prior approval of the DOJ
and that Seller is entering into this Agreement to obtain DOJ approval for the
DOJ Final Judgment in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Buyer,
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof (to the extent Buyer has not
already completed the following activities), will (i) prepare and furnish all
necessary information and documents reasonably requested by the DOJ, (ii) take
all actions necessary to demonstrate to the DOJ that Buyer is an acceptable
purchaser of the Purchased Assets and that Buyer will compete effectively
using the Purchased Assets, and (iii) reasonably cooperate with Seller in
obtaining all DOJ approvals, including the DOJ Consent and all required DOJ
approvals under the Merger Agreement. Each party shall promptly notify the
other party of any communication (including oral communications) it or any of
its Affiliates receives from the DOJ relating to the matters that are the
subject of this Agreement and consult with each other in advance of any
proposed communication by the receiving party to the DOJ. Buyer shall take all
actions necessary to obtain, and agrees to take all reasonable actions that
Seller reasonably requests in order to assist Seller in obtaining, DOJ
approvals for Buyer, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Merger.
Seller and Buyer shall promptly notify each other upon the occurrence (or
reasonably impending occurrence) of any of the following events: (i) Buyer is
not (or will not be) preliminarily approved by the DOJ or other necessary
Governmental Authority as a purchaser of the Purchased Assets hereunder; (ii) the DOJ Staff informs Seller or Buyer that the DOJ Staff will
not recommend approval of Buyer as purchaser of the Purchased Assets
hereunder; or (iii) the DOJ Staff informs Seller or Buyer that the DOJ Staff
will require the transfer to Buyer hereunder of any asset other than the
Purchased Assets or that the DOJ Staff will prohibit the transfer to Buyer
hereunder of any such Purchased Asset. Each of Buyer and Seller agree to
consider in good faith and discuss and reasonably cooperate with each other
any changes, amendments, modifications or waivers to this Agreement requested
by DOJ.



(f)Buyer shall, as promptly as practicable but in no event later than two (2)
Business Days following the date hereof, sign the Acknowledgment of
Applicability referred to in Section 3.3.



(g)Seller and Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to
(including, in the case of Seller, by using reasonable best efforts (including
by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune
and its Affiliates to) use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain
all consents and amendments from the parties to the Station Agreements which
are required by the terms thereof or this Agreement for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
neither Seller, Buyer, Tribune nor any of their respective Affiliates shall
have any obligation to offer or pay any consideration in order to obtain any
such consents or amendments, including, with respect to Seller, Tribune or any
of their respective Affiliates, any obligation to amend, modify or otherwise
alter the terms of any Contract with any such party that is not included in
the Purchased Assets or, insofar as any Multi-Station Contract relates to
Other Stations, the terms thereof relating to Other Stations; and provided,
further, that the parties acknowledge and agree that such Third Party consents
are not conditions to the Closing, except for the third party consents set
forth on Schedule 5.2(g) (the "Required Consents").



(h)Buyer agrees that, between the date of this Agreement until the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article
IX, except as contemplated by this Agreement, it shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, without the prior written
consent of Seller, (i) acquire any rights, assets, business or Person or merge
or consolidate with any other Person or enter into any binding share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction with another Person, (ii)
restructure, reorganize or completely or partially liquidate, (iii) make any
loan, advance or capital contribution to, or investment in, any other Person,
in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iii), that would reasonably be
expected to materially delay, impair or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or propose, announce an
intention, enter into any agreement or otherwise make a commitment to take any
such action or (iv) take any other action that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay, or to impede or prevent, the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
except for Buyer's agreements to acquire broadcast stations for which
applications are either pending before the FCC or approved by the FCC as of
the date of this Agreement and listed in Section 5.2(h) of the Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates and each Buyer
Attributable Party not to, directly or indirectly, acquire or agree to acquire
(including pursuant to any agreement to make such an acquisition even if such
agreement contains provisions that expressly preclude Buyer from taking
possession of any Barred Station) any interest that would be considered
"attributable" under the rules, regulations and policies of the FCC (including
but not limited to 47 C.F.R. 73.3555) in, or otherwise acquire (x) any
television broadcast station in any Market in which Buyer owns, operates, has
entered into any agreement to acquire or has any Cooperative Agreement with a
television broadcast station, in any Market in which any Station is located;
(y) any television broadcast station where such acquisition would result in
Buyer exceeding the ownership limitations set forth in the FCC's national
audience reach limitation contained in 47 C.F.R. Section 73.3555(e); or (z)
any television broadcast station, MVPD or related asset, business or Person or
division thereof that would reasonably be expected to materially delay, or to
impede or prevent, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The television broadcast
stations described in clauses (x), (y) and (z) of this Section 5.2(h) shall be
referred to herein as "Barred Stations".





Section 5.3. Public Announcements. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not and Seller and its Affiliates shall not,
and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce
its rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune and its Affiliates not
to, issue or cause the publication of any press release or other public
statement relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby without the prior written consent of the other party, unless such party
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that it is required by
applicable Law to issue or cause the publication of any press release or other
public announcement with respect to this Agreement, in which event such party
shall provide, on a basis reasonable under the circumstances, an opportunity
to the other party to review and comment on such press release or other
announcement in advance, and shall give reasonable consideration to all
reasonable comments suggested thereto.



Section 5.4. Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Seller and Buyer shall
promptly notify and provide copies to the other of (a) any material written
notice from any Person alleging that the approval or consent of such Person is
or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
(c) any Proceeding or investigation, commenced or, to its Knowledge,
threatened against, Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Buyer or any of its Affiliates, as the case may be, that would be reasonably
likely to (i) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or (ii) result in the failure of any condition to the
Closing set forth in Article VII to be satisfied, or (d) the occurrence of any
event which would or would be reasonably likely to (i) prevent or materially
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) result
in the failure of any condition to the Closing set forth in Article VII to be
satisfied; provided, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
5.4 shall not

(x)affect or be deemed to modify any representation, warranty, covenant,
right, remedy, or condition to any obligation of any party hereunder or (y)
update any section of the Disclosure Schedule.



Section 5.5. Access to the Business.



(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier to occur of
the Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article IX, upon reasonable advance notice and subject to applicable Law,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement) to cause Tribune and its Subsidiaries to, afford to Buyer, its
Affiliates and its officers, agents, control persons, employees, consultants,
professional advisers (including attorneys, accountants and financial
advisors) ("Representatives") reasonable access during normal business hours,
to all of the properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records, officers and
employees concerning the Business and the Purchased Assets, including the
right to inspect such properties and make copies of such records, and, during
such period Seller shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the
Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune and its Subsidiaries to, furnish to Buyer
all other information concerning the Business and the Purchased Assets as
Buyer may reasonably request; provided that Seller may restrict the foregoing
access and the disclosure of information to the extent that, in its good faith
judgment, (i) any Law applicable to Seller, Tribune or any of their respective
Subsidiaries requires it to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties
or information, (ii) the information is subject to confidentiality obligations
to a Third Party, (iii) disclosure of any such information or document could
result in the loss of attorney-client privilege or (iv) such access would
unreasonably disrupt the operations of the Business. Seller shall use reasonable best
efforts to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under
circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.



(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.5(a),
Buyer shall comply with, and shall cause its Representatives to comply with,
all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
January 11, 2019 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), by and between Seller,
Tribune and The E.W. Scripps Company, which agreement shall remain in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.



Section 5.6. Multi-Station Contracts. Section 5.6 of the Disclosure Schedule
contains a list as of the date hereof of each Contract which is included in
the Purchased Assets and to which any Other Station is party, or has rights or
obligations thereunder (any such Contract, a "Multi-Station Contract"). The
rights and obligations under the Multi-Station Contracts that are assigned to
and assumed by Buyer (and included in the Purchased Assets and Assumed
Liabilities, as the case may be) shall include only those rights and
obligations under such Multi-Station Contracts that are applicable to the
Stations. The rights of each Other Station with respect to such Contract and
the obligations of each Other Station to such Contract shall not be assigned
to and assumed by Buyer (and shall be Excluded Assets and Excluded
Liabilities, as applicable). For purposes of determining the scope of the
rights and obligations of the Multi-Station Contracts, the rights and
obligations under each Multi-Station Contract shall be equitably allocated
among (1) the Stations, on the one hand, and (2) the Other Stations, on the
other hand, in accordance with the following equitable allocation principles:



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

any allocation set forth in the Multi-Station Contract shall control; 

 

| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

if there is no allocation in the Multi-Station Contract as described in clause 

(a)hereof, then any reasonable allocation previously made by Seller or
Tribune, as applicable, in the ordinary course of business shall control; or



(c) if there is no reasonable allocation as described in clause (b) hereof,
then reasonable accommodation (to be determined by mutual good faith agreement
of Seller and Buyer) shall control.



Subject to any applicable third-party consents, such allocation and assignment
with respect to any Multi-Station Contract shall be effectuated, as mutually
agreed by Seller and Buyer, by termination of such Multi-Station Contract in
its entirety with respect to the Stations and the execution of new Contracts
with respect to the Stations or by an assignment to and assumption by Buyer of
the rights and obligations related to the Stations under such Multi-Station
Contract. The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain any such new
Contracts or assignments to, and assumptions by, Buyer in accordance with this
Section 5.6; provided, that, completion of documentation of any such
allocation under this Section 5.6 is not a condition to the Closing.





Section 5.7. Debt Financing Cooperation. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall,
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its reasonable best efforts
(including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to
cause Tribune and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
provide such customary cooperation as is reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided that such
requested cooperation does not (a) require Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to take any action that would violate any Laws or
would result in a violation or breach by Seller Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, or default under, any Contract to which such Person
is a party as of the date hereof or (b) result in any officer, manager or director of Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries incurring
any personal liability), including by using commercially reasonable efforts
to: (i) [reserved], (ii) furnish to Buyer as promptly as reasonably
practicable the Required Information, (iii) provide upon the reasonable
request of Buyer such information reasonably necessary to prepare a
confidential information memorandum (including a version that does not include
material non-public information (provided Seller shall not be required to
determine whether any information provided by Seller constitutes material non-
public information for the Debt Financing)) and other customary materials
reasonably required to complete the syndication, including a customary
authorization letter, (iv) assist Buyer in the preparation of (A) customary
materials for rating agency and investor presentations (including "roadshow"
or investor meeting slides), registration statements, offering memoranda,
prospectuses, private placement memoranda, and other customary marketing
materials and (B) definitive documentation for the Debt Financing, (v)
cooperate to facilitate the due diligence efforts of the Debt Financing
Sources relating to the Business, to the extent customary and reasonable and
not unreasonably interfering with the business of Seller, Tribune and their
respective Subsidiaries, (vi) facilitate the release of any Liens on the
Purchased Assets and the termination of all guarantees (if any) in connection

applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering rules and
regulations including the USA PATRIOT and beneficial ownership regulations, to
the extent reasonably requested by Buyer at least ten (10) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, (1) no such cooperation shall be required to the extent that it
would require Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries to take
any action that in the good faith judgment of Seller unreasonably interferes
with the ongoing business operation of Seller, Tribune and/or their respective
Subsidiaries or would require any directors, officers or employees to attend
any bank meeting, rating agency presentation, roadshows or other marketing
activities (other than, by any station managers who will continue to be
employed by Buyer after the Closing), (2) none of Seller, Tribune or any of
their respective Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or other
fee or incur any other liability or obligation in connection with the Debt
Financing, (3) none of Seller, Tribune or any of their respective Subsidiaries
shall be required to do anything that would cause the representation or
warranty of Seller in this Agreement to be breached or any condition to
Closing to fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this
Agreement by Seller and (4) none of Seller, Tribune or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or their respective director, officer or employee shall be
required to execute or deliver or have any liability or obligation under any
loan agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document
(including any certificates, legal opinions or pledge or security documents)
related to the Debt Financing. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Seller,
reimburse Seller for all reasonable and invoiced out-of- pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by Seller, Tribune or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation of Seller and
its Affiliates contemplated by this Section 5.7. All non-public or other
confidential information provided by Seller, Tribune or any of their
respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this Agreement will be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Buyer will be
permitted to disclose such information to any Debt Financing Sources or
prospective Debt Financing Sources and other financial institutions and
investors that may become parties to the Debt Financing and to any
underwriters, initial purchasers, lead arrangers or placement agents in
connection with the Debt Financing (and, in each case, to their respective
counsel and auditors) so long as such Persons (x) agree to be bound by the
Confidentiality Agreement as if parties thereto or other confidentiality
obligations that are substantially similar to those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement or (y) are subject to customary confidentiality
arrangements, or other confidentiality undertakings reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and of which Buyer is a beneficiary. 

Section 5.8. Interim Reports.



(a) Within forty-five (45) days after the end of each calendar month during
the period from the Balance Sheet Date through the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its
rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to, provide to Buyer, with
respect to the Business and the Stations, the unaudited statement of
operations for such month ended. Such unaudited statements of operations shall
be prepared on the same basis as the Financial Statements.



(b) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement) to cause Tribune to the extent permitted pursuant to the Merger
Agreement, provide to Buyer bi-weekly roll-up pacing reports for the Stations
promptly following the end of every other week during the period from the date
hereof through the Closing.



Section 5.9. Title Commitments; Surveys. Buyer shall have the responsibility
to obtain, if it so elects at its sole option and expense, (a) commitments for
owner's and lender's title insurance policies on the Owned Real Property and
commitments for lessee's and lender's title insurance policies for real
property that is leased pursuant to a Real Property Lease (collectively, the
"Title Commitments") evidencing a commitment to issue an ALTA title insurance
policy insuring good, marketable and indefeasible fee simple (or leasehold, if
applicable) title to each parcel of the Real Property contemplated above for
such amount as Buyer directs, and (b) an ALTA survey on each parcel of Real
Property (the "Surveys"). Seller shall, and, to the extent permitted under the
Merger Agreement, shall use its reasonable best efforts (including by seeking
to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to,
reasonably cooperate with Buyer in obtaining such Title Commitments and
Surveys; provided that neither Seller nor Tribune shall be required to incur
any cost, expense or other liability in connection therewith, provided,
further, that the parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer's receipt of such
Title Commitments and Surveys is not a condition to the Closing. If the Title
Commitments or Surveys reveal any Lien on the title or Real Property other
than Permitted Liens, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of such
objectionable matter promptly after Buyer becomes aware that such matter is
not a Permitted Lien, and Seller agrees to, and, to the extent permitted under
the Merger Agreement, shall use its reasonable best efforts (including by
seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to remove such objectionable matter.
Notwithstanding the following, it is expressly understood and agreed that
Seller's obligations pursuant to this Section 5.9 are not conditions to the
consummation of the Closing and any failure by Seller to remove any such
objectionable matter shall not delay the Closing.



Section 5.10. Phase I Environmental Assessments. Prior to Closing Buyer shall
have the right, at its sole cost and expense, to engage an environmental
consulting firm to conduct a Phase I Environmental Assessment and Compliance
Review, as such terms are commonly understood ("Phase I Environmental
Assessment") with respect to any and all Owned Real Property, provided that
(a) any such Phase I Environmental Assessment shall be conducted only (i)
during regular business hours, (ii) with no less than five (5) Business Days
prior written notice to Seller, (iii) in a manner which will not unduly
interfere with the operation of the Business and (iv) not involve any use or
operation of equipment or any sampling or testing of environmental medial and
(b) in respect of the Owned Real Property of the Tribune Business, Buyer and
its consultants shall not be permitted to take any action on such Owned Real
Property in connection with the conduct of any such Phase I Environmental
Assessment that is prohibited by the Merger Agreement. Any damage to the Owned
Real Property caused by Buyer and its consultants in conducting any such Phase I Environmental Assessment shall be repaired by
Buyer at its sole cost and expense.

(a)Employment. At least three (3) weeks prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
use commercially reasonable efforts, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts (including by seeking to enforce its rights under the Merger
Agreement) to cause Tribune to, deliver to Buyer an updated Section 3.15(a) of
the Disclosure Schedule that contains: (i) a list of all full-time, part- time
and per diem Employees as of a then-recent date and (ii) each such Employee's
(A) job title, (B) date of hire and (C) rate of compensation as of such date.
As of or before the Closing, Buyer or one or more of its Affiliates shall
offer employment to each Employee who (i) is not then on authorized leave of
absence, sick leave, short or long term disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights ("Active
Employees"); or (ii) is then on authorized leave of absence, sick leave, or
short term disability leave, military leave or layoff with recall rights and
who returns to active employment immediately following such absence and within
six (6) months of the Closing Date, or such later date as required under
applicable Laws ("Inactive Employees"). For the purposes hereof, all Active
Employees and Inactive Employees who accept an offer of employment from Buyer
and commence employment on the applicable Employment Commencement Date are
hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Transferred Employees," and the
"Employment Commencement Date" as referred to herein shall mean (x) as to
those Transferred Employees who are Active Employees, the Closing Date, and
(y) as to those Transferred Employees who are Inactive Employees, the date on
which the Transferred Employee begins employment with Buyer or any of its
Affiliates. Buyer shall employ at-will those Transferred Employees who do not
have Employment Agreements with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, and shall
provide each Transferred Employee initially and for at least one (1) year
after the Closing Date, (i) the base salary or other base cash compensation
that was provided to such Transferred Employees immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) cash incentive compensation opportunities (including short-term
annual incentive compensation but excluding equity or equity-based
compensation) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the aggregate
total cash incentive compensation opportunities provided to such Transferred
Employee (but excluding equity or equity-based compensation opportunities)
immediately prior to the Closing, (iii) severance and any other termination
pay and benefits plans, practices and policies that are no less favorable than
such plans, practices and policies that were applicable to such Transferred
Employee immediately prior to the Closing and (iv) other employee benefits
that are substantially similar in the aggregate to those provided to similarly
situated employees of Buyer as of immediately prior to the Closing. The
initial terms and conditions of employment for those Transferred Employees who
have Employment Agreements with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, shall be as
set forth in such Employment Agreements, which shall, to the extent permitted
under the applicable agreements, be assigned to and assumed by Buyer or one or
more of its Affiliates, as directed by Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Buyer shall cause to be maintained through December 31 of the year in which
the Closing Date occurs those annual (or other short-term) cash incentive
award programs covering the Transferred Employees substantially in the form as
in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 6.2(b)-(h), below, the compensation, benefits, and other
terms and conditions of employment for Transferred Employees who are covered
by a Collective Bargaining Agreement shall be as initially set by Buyer,
subject to negotiations with the labor union representing the respective
Transferred Employees; provided, however that the terms and conditions of
employment for those Transferred Employees who are covered by the Collective
Bargaining Agreement set forth on Section 6.2(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be provided in accordance with such Collective Bargaining Agreement,
subject to negotiations with the labor union representing such Transferred
Employees.



(b)Service Credit. For purposes of determining eligibility to participate,
level of benefits, vesting and benefit accrual (other than benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan) under any plan maintained by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, recognize or
cause to be recognized for purposes of eligibility, level of benefits, vesting
and benefit accruals each Transferred Employee's service with Seller or
Tribune, as applicable, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent
recognized by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, as service with Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to the same extent such service was recognized immediately
prior to the Closing, except that such service need not be recognized to the
extent such recognition would result in the duplication of benefits for the
same period of service.



(c)Payment of Bonuses. To the extent Seller would otherwise have been required
pursuant to Section 6.4(d) of the Merger Agreement to make any bonus payments
in respect of any Transferred Employee had such Transferred Employee remained
employed by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, following the Closing and as of the applicable payment date, Buyer
shall make such payments to all such Transferred Employees as and when
required to be paid pursuant to Section 6.4(d) of the Merger Agreement and
otherwise perform all covenants of Seller thereunder in respect of such
Transferred Employees, in each case, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein.



(d)401(k) Plan. Buyer shall cause a tax-qualified defined contribution plan
established or designated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates ("Buyer's 401(k)
Plan") to accept rollover contributions from the Transferred Employees of any
account balances distributed to them by the existing tax-qualified defined
contribution plan established or designated by Seller or Tribune, as
applicable, or any of their respective Affiliates ("Seller's 401(k) Plan").
Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, as applicable, to, allow any such
Transferred Employees' outstanding plan loans under Seller's 401(k) Plan to be
rolled into Buyer's 401(k) Plan. The distribution and rollover described
herein shall comply with applicable Laws, and Buyer and Seller shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, make all filings and take any
actions required of each such Person by applicable Laws in connection
therewith.



(e)Welfare Plans. Seller shall retain responsibility for and continue to pay
all medical, life insurance, disability and other welfare plan expenses and
benefits for each Transferred Employee with respect to claims incurred under
the terms of the Employee Plans by such Employees and their covered dependents
prior to the Employment Commencement Date. Expenses and benefits with respect
to claims incurred by Transferred Employees and their covered dependents on or
after the Employment Commencement Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer
and its Affiliates. With respect to any welfare benefit plans maintained by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates in which the Transferred Employees are eligible
to participate on or after the Employment Commencement Date, to the extent
permitted by Law, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to (i) cause
there to be waived any eligibility requirements or pre-existing condition
limitations and (ii) give effect, in determining any deductible and maximum
out-of-pocket limitations, amounts paid by such Transferred Employees (and
their covered dependents) under the Employee Plans.



(f)Vacation. Buyer shall assume as of the Closing all liabilities for unpaid,
accrued vacation of each Transferred Employee as of such Transferred
Employee's Employment Commencement Date, giving service credit under the Paid
Time Off ("PTO") policy of Buyer for service with Seller or Tribune, as
applicable, and shall permit Transferred Employees to use their vacation
entitlement accrued as of Closing in accordance with the PTO policy of Buyer
as of the Closing.



(g)Sick Leave. Buyer shall grant credit to Transferred Employees under its PTO
policy for all unused sick leave accrued by Transferred Employees in
accordance with Buyer's PTO policy as of Closing.

Payroll Matters. 

 

(i) Seller and Buyer shall follow the "standard procedures" for preparing and
filing Internal Revenue Service Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statements), as
described in Revenue Procedure 2004-53 for Transferred Employees. Under this
procedure, (A) Seller shall provide all required Forms W-2 to (x) all
Transferred Employees reflecting wages paid and taxes withheld by Seller or
Tribune, as applicable, prior to the Employment Commencement Date, and (y) all
other employees and former employees of Seller or Tribune, as applicable, who
are not Transferred Employees reflecting all wages paid and taxes withheld by
Seller or Tribune, as applicable, and (B) Buyer (or one of its Affiliates, as applicable,) shall provide all
required Forms W-2 to all Transferred Employees reflecting all wages paid and
taxes withheld by Buyer (or one of its Affiliates) on and after the Employment
Commencement Date.



(ii) With respect to garnishments, tax levies, child support orders, and wage
assignments in effect with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, on the Employment
Commencement Date for Transferred Employees and with respect to which Seller
has notified Buyer in writing, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
honor such payroll deduction authorizations with respect to Transferred
Employees and shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, continue to make
payroll deductions and payments to the authorized payee, as specified by a
court or order which was filed with Seller or Tribune, as applicable, on or
before the Employment Commencement Date, to the extent such payroll deductions
and payments are in compliance with applicable Laws, and Seller will continue
to make such payroll deductions and payments to authorized payees as required
by Laws with respect to all other employees of the Business who are not
Transferred Employees. Seller shall, as soon as practicable after the
Employment Commencement Date, provide Buyer with such information in the
possession of Seller as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and necessary for
Buyer or its Affiliates to make the payroll deductions and payments to the
authorized payee as required by this Section 6.2(i).



(j)WARN Act. Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take any
action on or after the Closing that would cause any termination of employment
of any employees by Seller or Tribune, as applicable, that occurs before the
Closing to constitute a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" under the Worker
Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988, as amended (the "WARN Act") or any
similar state or local Laws, or to create any liability to Seller or any of
its Affiliates for any employment terminations under applicable Laws. Buyer
shall be responsible for all liabilities with respect to any amounts
(including any severance, fines or penalties) payable under or pursuant to the
WARN Act or any similar state or local Laws with respect to any Employees who
do not become Transferred Employees as a result of the failure of Buyer to
extend offers of employment or continued employment as required by Section 6.2
or in connection with events that occur from and after the Closing, and Buyer
shall reimburse Seller for any such amounts.



(k)ERISA Section 4204. With respect to the Stations, Seller or Tribune or any
of their Subsidiaries, as applicable, employs Employees who are members of the
collective bargaining units listed on Section 6.2(k)(1) of the Disclosure
Schedule and who are subject to the collective bargaining agreements listed on
Section 6.2(k)(2) of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "CBAs").
Pursuant to the CBAs, Seller or Tribune or any of their Subsidiaries, as
applicable, is obligated to contribute to the multiemployer pension plans
listed on Section 6.2(k)(3) of the Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the
"Multiemployer Pension Plans"). Seller and Buyer intend by the provisions that
follow to comply with the requirements of Section 4204 of ERISA with respect
to the Multiemployer Pension Plans in connection with the acquisition of the
Purchased Assets. Buyer shall have an obligation to contribute to each
Multiemployer Pension Plan with respect to the operations related to the
Purchased Assets for substantially the same number of contribution base units
for which Seller or Tribune or any of their Subsidiaries, as applicable, had
an obligation to contribute to each Multiemployer Pension Plan with respect to
the operations related to the Purchased Assets. Except as set forth below,
Buyer shall provide to each Multiemployer Pension Plan, for a period of five
(5) plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the Closing
Date, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety
for purposes of Section 412 of ERISA, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or
similar financial institution satisfactory to the Multiemployer Pension Plan,
in an amount equal to the greater of: (i) the average total annual
contribution to such Multiemployer Pension Plan required to be made by Seller
or Tribune or any of their Subsidiaries, as applicable, with respect to the operations related to the Purchased Assets
for the three (3) plan years preceding the plan year in which the Closing
occurs; or (ii) the annual contribution that Seller or Tribune or any of their
Subsidiaries, as applicable, was required to make to each such Multiemployer
Pension Plan with respect to the operations related to the Purchased Assets
for the last plan year before the plan year in which the Closing occurs. If
Buyer withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal from any
Multiemployer Pension Plan during the first five (5) plan years following the
Closing, Seller or Tribune or any of their Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
be secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to such
Multiemployer Pension Plan with respect to the operations related to the
Purchased Assets if the liability of Buyer with respect to the Multiemployer
Pension Plan is not paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, but only
to the extent Buyer and Seller inform the applicable Multiemployer Pension
Plan in writing of their intent that this Agreement be covered by Section 4204
of ERISA and satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR §4204.11 and the applicable
Multiemployer Pension Plan, if (i) the amount of the bond or escrow for a
particular Multiemployer Pension Plan is de minimis as defined under
Department of Labor Regulation §4204.12 or (ii) Buyer otherwise meets the "net
income test" or the "net tangible asset test" under Department of Labor
Regulation §4204.13(a), taking into account the special rule when more than
one plan is covered by the test as set forth in 29 CFR §4204.13(b), then Buyer
shall not be obligated to post such bond or establish such escrow. For
purposes of this Section 6.2(k), Seller agrees that if so requested by Buyer,
it will cooperate with Buyer to notify the applicable Multiemployer Pension
Plan, in writing, of their intent that this Agreement be covered by Section
4204 of ERISA and, if applicable, to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR
§4204.11 and the applicable Multiemployer Pension Plan.



(l)Without limiting the generality of Section 10.8, nothing in this Section
6.2, express or implied, is intended to confer on any Person (including any
Transferred Employees and any current or former employees of Seller or Tribune
or any of their Affiliates, as applicable, other than the parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities (including any third-party beneficiary rights)
under or by reason of this Section 6.2. Accordingly, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Section 6.2, the parties expressly acknowledge and
agree that this Agreement is not intended to create a Contract between Buyer,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and any
employee of Seller or Tribune or any of their Affiliates on the other hand,
and no employee of Seller or Tribune or any of their Affiliates may rely on
this Agreement as the basis for any breach of Contract claim against Buyer,
Seller or any of their respective Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 6.2
shall constitute an amendment to or modification of any Employee Plan or other
compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement.



Section 6.3. [Omitted].



Section 6.4. Use of Names. Seller is not conveying ownership rights or
granting Buyer a license to use any of the Retained Names and Marks and, after
the Closing, Buyer shall not and shall not permit any of its Affiliates to use
in any manner the Retained Names and Marks or any word that is similar in
sound or appearance to such names or marks. In the event Buyer violates any of
its obligations under this Section 6.4, Seller may proceed against Buyer in
law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a court may deem
appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this Section 6.4 would
cause Seller irreparable harm, which may not be adequately compensated for by
money damages. Buyer therefore agrees that in the event of any actual or
threatened violation of this Section 6.4, Seller shall be entitled, in
addition to other remedies that it may have, to a temporary restraining order
and to preliminary and final injunctive relief against Buyer or any such
Affiliate of Buyer to prevent any violations of this Section 6.4, without the
necessity of posting a bond.

 Section 6.5. Receivables. Within twenty (20) Business Days after the end of
the calendar month in which the Closing occurs, Seller will deliver to Buyer a
written statement (the "Seller's Statement") setting forth the outstanding
advertising accounts receivable of the Business as of the Cutoff Time (the
"Accounts Receivable"). Buyer will use reasonable best efforts to collect the
Accounts Receivable in the same manner and with the same diligence that Buyer
uses to collect its own accounts receivable, including account reconciliation
procedures, for a period of one-hundred eighty (180) calendar days following
the Closing Date (the "Collection Period"). Buyer will not be obligated to,
and without the prior written consent of Seller will not, institute
litigation, employ any collection agency, legal counsel or other Third Party,
or take any other extraordinary means of collections or pay any expenses to
Third Parties to collect the Accounts Receivable. All amounts collected by
Buyer after the Closing from an account debtor of the Business will be applied
first to the Accounts Receivable of such account debtor in the order of their
origination, unless the account debtor disputes such Accounts Receivable in
writing or designates payment of a different accounts receivable in writing.
If during the Collection Period a dispute arises with regard to an account
included among the Accounts Receivable, Buyer shall promptly advise Seller
thereof and may (or, if requested by Seller in writing, shall) return that
account to Seller. Buyer shall pay to Seller, as soon as reasonably
practicable but in any event within thirty (30) calendar days after the end of
each month during the Collection Period, the actual receipt of the proceeds of
the Accounts Receivable collected by Buyer during such month. At the end of
the Collection Period, collection of any remaining Accounts Receivable shall
be returned to Seller.

Section 6.6. Access to Records after the Closing.



(a)For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Seller and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
of the Business transferred to Buyer hereunder to the extent that such access
may reasonably be required by Seller in connection with matters relating to or
affected by the operations of the Business prior to the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Buyer upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Seller shall be solely responsible for any
costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 6.6(a). If Buyer
shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six (6) year period, it shall, prior to such disposition,
give Seller a reasonable opportunity, at Seller's expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as Seller may select.



(b)For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer and its
Representatives shall have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Business which Seller may retain after the Closing Date. Such
access shall be afforded by Seller upon receipt of reasonable advance notice
and during normal business hours. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any
costs and expenses incurred by it pursuant to this Section 6.6(b). If Seller
shall desire to dispose of any of such books and records prior to the
expiration of such six (6) year period, it shall, prior to such disposition,
give Buyer a reasonable opportunity, at Buyer's expense, to segregate and
remove such books and records as Buyer may select.



Section 6.7. No Solicitation.



(a)From the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing and the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with Article IX, Seller shall not, and shall
not authorize or permit any of its Affiliates or any of its Representatives to

rights under the Merger Agreement) to cause Tribune and its Affiliates not
to), directly or indirectly, (i) encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or
continue inquiries regarding an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
concerning a possible Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other
instruments (whether or not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller
shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated, and shall cause its
Affiliates and all of their respective Representatives to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. For purposes hereof, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person (other than Buyer or any of its
Affiliates) relating to the direct or indirect disposition, whether by sale,
merger or otherwise, of all or any material portion of the Business or the
Purchased Assets, but specifically excludes the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.



(b)From the Closing Date until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates to, solicit, hire or attempt to hire for employment any Transferred
Employee, without the prior written consent of Buyer, provided that (i) Seller
and its Affiliates may solicit and hire any such Transferred Employee who has
been terminated by Buyer or any of its Affiliates, (ii) Seller and its
Affiliates may solicit and hire any such Transferred Employee whose employment
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates has been terminated by such Transferred
Employee at any time after the six-month anniversary of such termination and
(iii) nothing in this sentence shall prohibit Seller or any of its Affiliates
from engaging in general solicitation that is not directed specifically to any
such Transferred Employees or hiring any person who responds to any such
general solicitation; provided, that Seller and its Affiliates shall not be
prohibited from (A) soliciting any employees employed at the Station with the
call sign "WPIX" following the exercise of Seller's option to acquire WPIX
pursuant to the Option Agreement or (B) hiring any employees employed at the
Station with the call sign "WPIX" effective as of the closing of Seller's
acquisition of WPIX pursuant to the Option Agreement.



(c)From the Closing Date until the twelve (12) month anniversary of the
Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of its
Affiliates to, solicit, hire or attempt to hire for employment any individual
employed by Seller, Tribune or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date,
without the prior written consent of Seller, provided that (i) Buyer and its
Affiliates may solicit and hire any such individual who has been terminated by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) Buyer and its Affiliates may solicit
and hire any such individual whose employment with Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries has been terminated by such individual at any time after the six-
month anniversary of such termination and (iii) nothing in this sentence shall
prohibit Buyer or any of its Affiliates from engaging in general solicitation
that is not directed specifically to any such individual or hiring any person
who responds to any such general solicitation.

(a)Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to Buyer the
Required Information by July 1, 2019. Subject to the definition thereof, the

material respects (subject, in the case of the unaudited quarterly financial

INDEMNIFICATION



Section 8.1. Indemnification by Seller. From and after the Closing and subject

to Section 10.1, Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Group
Members from and against any and all Losses and Expenses imposed upon, or
incurred or suffered by, any Buyer Group Member as a result of or arising out
of:



(a) any breach by Seller of, or any other failure of Seller to perform, any of
its covenants, agreements or obligations pursuant to this Agreement;



| 
---|--- 

(b)

|

any of the Excluded Liabilities; or 

 

(c) any failure or inability of Seller in any material respect to cause
Tribune and its Subsidiaries to take, or not take, any action in compliance
with the covenants set forth in Section 5.1.



Section 8.2. Indemnification by Buyer. From and after the Closing and subject
to Section 10.1, Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Group
Members from and

against any and all Losses and Expenses imposed upon, or incurred or suffered
by, any Seller Group Member as a result of or arising out of:



(a)any breach by Buyer of, or any other failure of Buyer to perform, any of
its covenants, agreements or obligations in this Agreement; or



(b)any of the Assumed Liabilities and, except for claims in respect of which
Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer Group Members pursuant to Section 8.1,
Buyer's (or any successor's or assignee's) operation of the Business and/or
the ownership and/or use of the Purchased Assets after the Closing Date.



Section 8.3. Notice of Claims; Determination of Amount.



(a)Any party seeking indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnified Party") shall
give promptly to the party or parties, as applicable, obligated to provide
indemnification to such Indemnified Party (the "Indemnitor") a written notice
(a "Claim Notice") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to
the claim for indemnification hereunder and shall include in such Claim Notice
(if then known) the amount or the method of computation of the amount of such
claim, and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any certificate
delivered hereunder upon which such claim is based. Subject to Section 10.1,
the failure of any Indemnified Party to give the Claim Notice promptly as
required by this Section 8.3 shall not affect such Indemnified Party's rights under this Article VIII
except to the extent such failure is actually and materially prejudicial to
the rights and obligations of the Indemnitor.



(b)In calculating any Loss or Expense there shall be deducted (i) any
insurance recovery actually received in respect thereof, (ii) any recovery in
respect thereof which is obtained from any other third Person (and no right of
subrogation shall accrue hereunder to any such insurer or other third Person)
and (iii) any Tax benefit realized by the Indemnified Party arising from any
such Loss or Expense.



(c)After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the amount of
indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be entitled under this
Article VIII shall be determined: (i) by the written agreement between the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final Order of any court of
competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any other means to which the Indemnified
Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The judgment or decree of a court shall
be deemed final when the time for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no
appeal shall have been taken or when all appeals taken shall have been finally
determined. The Indemnified Party shall have the burden of proof in
establishing the amount of Losses and Expenses suffered by it.



Section 8.4. Third Person Claims.



(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 8.3, in order
for a party to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim or demand made by
any third Person against the Indemnified Party, such Indemnified Party must
notify the Indemnitor in writing, and in reasonable detail, of the third
Person claim promptly, but in any event within ten (10) days, after receipt by
such Indemnified Party of written notice of the third Person claim, which
notification must include a copy of the written notice of the third Person
claim that was received by the Indemnified Party (the "Third Person Claim
Notice"). Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnitor,
promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, after the
Indemnified Party's receipt thereof, copies of all notices and documents
(including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the
third Person claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should a party be
physically served with a complaint with regard to a third Person claim, the
Indemnified Party must notify the Indemnitor with a copy of the complaint
promptly, but in any event within five (5) Business Days, after receipt
thereof and shall deliver to the Indemnitor promptly, but in any event within
seven (7) Business Days, after the receipt of such complaint copies of notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the third Person claim. Subject to Section 10.1, the failure of
any Indemnified Party to promptly provide a Third Person Claim Notice as
required by this Section 8.4 shall not affect such Indemnified Party's rights
under this Article VIII except to the extent such failure is actually and
materially prejudicial to the rights and obligations of the Indemnitor.



(b)In the event of the initiation of any legal proceeding against the
Indemnified Party by a third Person, the Indemnitor shall have the sole and
absolute right after the receipt of a Third Person Claim Notice, at its option
and at its own expense, to be represented by counsel of its choice and to
control, defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any loss, liability or damage
indemnified against hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party
may participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at its
expense. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such proceeding,
claim or demand. Prior to the time the Indemnified Party is notified by the
Indemnitor as to whether the Indemnitor will assume the defense of such
proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall take all actions
reasonably necessary to timely preserve the collective rights of the parties
with respect to such proceeding, claim or demand, including responding timely
to legal process. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to defend such proceeding, claim or demand (or fails
to confirm its election) within fifteen (15) days after the giving by the
Indemnified Party to the Indemnitor of a Third Person Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel, reasonably acceptable to the Indemnitor,
at the expense of the Indemnitor, and control the defense of, or otherwise
deal with, such proceeding, claim or demand. Regardless of which party assumes
the defense of such proceeding, claim or demand, the parties agree to
cooperate with one another in connection therewith. Such cooperation shall
include providing records and information that are relevant to such
proceeding, claim or demand, and making each parties' employees and officers
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or
respond to legal process. Whether or not the Indemnitor assumes the defense of
such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any
liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such
proceeding, claim or demand without the Indemnitor's prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The Indemnitor shall not consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any
judgment arising from, any such proceeding, claim or demand without the
Indemnified Party's prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such settlement or
judgment (i) relates solely to monetary damages for which the Indemnitor shall
be responsible and (ii) includes as an unconditional term thereof the release
of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect to such proceeding,
claim or demand, in which event no such consent shall be required. After any
final judgment or award shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board
or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction and the time in which to
appeal therefrom has expired, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall arrive at a mutually binding
agreement with respect to each separate matter alleged to be indemnified by
the Indemnitor hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnitor notice of any sums due and owing by it with respect to such matter
and the Indemnitor shall pay all of the sums so owing to the Indemnified Party
by wire transfer, certified or bank cashier's check within fifteen (15) days
after the date of such notice.



(c)The party that has assumed the control or defense of any such proceeding,
claim or demand made by a third Person against the other party shall (i)
provide the other party with the right to participate in any meetings or
negotiations with any Governmental Authority or other third Person and
reasonable advance notice of any such meetings or negotiations, (ii) provide
the other party with the right to review in advance and provide comments on
any draft or final documents proposed to be submitted to any Governmental
Authority or other third Person, and (iii) keep the other party reasonably
informed with respect to such proceeding, demand or claim, including providing
copies of all documents provided to, or received from, any Governmental
Authority or any other third Person in connection with such proceeding, demand
or claim. Buyer Group Members, on the one hand, and Seller Group Members, on
the other hand, covenant and agree to maintain the confidence of all such
drafts and comments provided by the other.



(d)To the extent of any inconsistency between this Section 8.4 and Section
6.1(c) with respect to Taxes, the provisions of Section 6.1(c) shall control.





Section 8.5. Limitations; Subrogation; Exclusive Remedies.



(a)In any case where the Indemnified Party recovers from third Persons any
amount in respect of a matter with respect to which the Indemnitor has
indemnified it pursuant to this Article VIII, the Indemnified Party shall
promptly pay over to the Indemnitor the amount so recovered (after deducting
therefrom the full amount of the Expenses incurred by it in procuring such
recovery), but not in excess of any amount previously so paid by the
Indemnitor to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such matter. 

(b)In the case where the Indemnitor makes any payment to the Indemnified Party
in respect of any Loss, the Indemnitor shall, to the extent of such payment,
be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Party against any third Person
in respect of the Loss to which such payment relates. The Indemnified Party
and the Indemnitor shall execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.



(c)Except for remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law, claims
arising from common law fraud with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth herein, and injunctive and provisional relief, if the
Closing occurs, this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy for breaches
of this Agreement (including any covenant, obligation, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant
to this Agreement) or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement, including any claims arising under any Environmental Laws.



Section 8.6. No Special Damages; Mitigation. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the parties hereto shall have
any liability under any provision of this Article VIII (i) for any punitive or
exemplary damages, except to the extent such damages are actually awarded to a
third Person and (ii) any multiple, consequential, special or indirect
damages, including loss of future profits, revenue or income, damages based on
any multiple of revenue or income, diminution in value or loss of business
reputation or opportunity or statutory damages relating to the breach or
alleged breach, except to the extent such damages were reasonably foreseeable
or to the extent such damages are actually awarded to a third Person. Each of
the parties agrees to take all commercially reasonable steps to mitigate their
respective Losses and Expenses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses and
Expenses that are indemnifiable hereunder, including using its reasonable best
efforts to obtain insurance proceeds in respect thereof.



Section 8.7. Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification
payments made under this Agreement shall be treated for Tax purposes only as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law.



ARTICLE IX TERMINATION



Section 9.1. Termination.



| 
---|--- 

(a)

|

This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

 

| 
---|--- 

(i)

|

by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer; 

 

(ii) by Seller, if a breach or failure to perform any of the covenants or
agreements of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall have occurred, or there
shall be any inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer
contained in this Agreement, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy
either individually or in the aggregate would, if occurring or continuing on
the Closing Date, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.3 to be satisfied, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy if
curable, is not cured by, on or before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date
or (ii) thirty (30) days following Buyer's receipt of written notice from
Seller of such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy, or which by its
nature or timing cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that Seller shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(a)(ii)
if Seller is then in breach of any of its covenants or agreements contained in
this Agreement or any of the representations or warranties of Seller contained
in this Agreement shall be inaccurate, and, in any such case would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2 to be satisfied;



(iii) by Buyer, if a breach or failure to perform any of the covenants or
agreements of Seller contained in this Agreement shall have occurred, or there
shall be any inaccuracy of any of the representations or warranties of Seller
contained in this Agreement, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy
either individually or in the aggregate would, if occurring or continuing on
the Closing Date, give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section
7.2 to be satisfied, and such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy if
curable, is not cured by, on or before the earlier of (i) the Termination Date
or (ii) thirty (30) days following Seller's receipt of written notice from
Buyer of such breach, failure to perform or inaccuracy, or which by its nature
or timing cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date; provided, however,
that Buyer shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(a)(iii) if Buyer is then in breach of any of its covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or any of the representations or
warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall be inaccurate, and, in
any such case would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
Section 7.3 to be satisfied;

jurisdiction shall have issued a final and nonappealable Order permanently
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the sale of the
Purchased Assets contemplated hereby;



(v) by Seller or Buyer if the Closing shall not have been consummated on or
before March 30, 2020 (the "Termination Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 9.1(a)(v) shall not
be available to any party if the failure of the Closing to occur by such date
shall be due to the failure of such party to perform or observe the covenants
and agreements of such party set forth in this Agreement;



(vi) by Seller if the DOJ states conclusively to Seller and Buyer that it will
not provide DOJ Consent pursuant to the DOJ Final Judgment; or



(vii) by Seller or Buyer upon the valid termination of the Merger Agreement

(other than pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i)) shall give written notice of such

terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(a), all further obligations of the parties
under this Agreement (other than Section 5.3, this Article IX and Article X,
and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement, which, in each
case, shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding such termination)
shall be terminated without further liability of any party; provided that
nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this
Agreement.

provisions of this Article IX, all filings, applications and other submissions
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as to which termination has occurred shall, to the extent
practicable, be withdrawn from the Governmental Authority or other Person to

ARTICLE X MISCELLANEOUS



Section 10.1. Survival.



(a)None the representations or warranties of the parties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall
survive the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
9.1, as the case may be; provided, however, that claims for common law fraud
with respect to the representations and warranties set forth herein shall not
be subject to such limitation or any other limitation contained in this
Agreement.



(b)None of the covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties contained
in this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the Closing, except to the
extent such covenants, agreements and obligations contemplate performance
after the Closing, in which case each such covenant, agreement and obligation
shall survive until performed.



(c)No claim may be brought under this Agreement unless written notice
describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to the claim is given on
or prior to the last day of the applicable survival period. In the event such
notice is given, the right to indemnification with respect thereto shall
survive the applicable survival period until such claim is finally resolved
and any obligations with respect thereto are fully satisfied.



Section 10.2. Amendment and Modification. Subject to applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented in any and all respects by
written agreement of Seller and Buyer at any time whether prior to or after
the Closing with respect to any of the terms contained herein. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, none of the Debt Financing Provisions may be
amended, modified or waived in a manner adverse to the Debt Financing Sources
without the prior consent of the Debt Financing Sources.



Section 10.3. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Closing, subject to
applicable Law, Buyer on the one hand, or Seller on the other hand, may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement of the other party or (c) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement.
Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights, nor shall
any single or partial exercise by any party of any of its rights under this
Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.



Section 10.4. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein, all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense. Section 10.5. Disclosure Schedule References. All capitalized terms not
defined in the Disclosure Schedule to this Agreement (the "Disclosure
Schedule") shall have the meanings assigned to them in this Agreement. The
Disclosure Schedule shall, for all purposes in this Agreement, be arranged in
numbered and lettered parts and subparts corresponding to the numbered and
lettered sections and subsections contained in this Agreement. Each item
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an exception to or, as
applicable, disclosure for the purposes of, the representations and warranties
(or covenants, as applicable) to which it makes express reference and shall
also be deemed to be disclosed or set forth for the purposes of every other
part in the Disclosure Schedule relating to the representations and warranties
(or covenants, as applicable) set forth in this Agreement to the extent a
cross-reference within the Disclosure Schedule is expressly made to such other
part in the Disclosure Schedule, as well as to the extent that the relevance
of such item as an exception to or, as applicable, disclosure for purposes of,
such other section of this Agreement is reasonably apparent from the face of
such disclosure. The listing of any matter on the Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission by Seller or Buyer, as applicable, or
to otherwise imply, that any such matter is material, is required to be
disclosed by Seller or Buyer under this Agreement or falls within relevant
minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this Agreement. No
disclosure in the Disclosure Schedule relating to any possible breach or
violation by Seller or Buyer of any Contract or Law shall be construed as an
admission or indication that any such breach or violation exists or has
actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of any matter in the
Disclosure Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.



Section 10.6. Notices. All notices and other communications hereunder shall be
in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, by facsimile
(with confirmation of transmission), by email (with confirmation of receipt)

Section 10.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement, it
being understood that each party hereto need not sign the same counterpart.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto.
Signatures delivered electronically or by facsimile shall be deemed to be
original signatures.



Section 10.8. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred
to herein), the Disclosure Schedule, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Seller
Ancillary Agreements and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements (a) constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between Seller and Buyer with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and (b) are not intended to and do not confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the
parties, their respective successors and permitted assigns, and the Buyer
Group Members and Seller Group Members pursuant to Article VIII.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debt Financing Sources shall be third-party
beneficiaries of each of the Debt Financing Provisions.



Section 10.9. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other authority to be invalid,
void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect
and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as the
economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby, taken as
a whole, is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any party hereto.
Upon such a determination, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.





Section 10.10. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties
hereto, in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise),
without the prior written consent of the other party, and any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, Buyer shall be permitted to collaterally assign its rights
and remedies under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to any Debt
Financing Source in respect of the Debt Financing, but no such assignment
shall relieve any such assignor of its obligations under this Agreement or any
of the Ancillary Agreements. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to
the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.



Section 10.11. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, without
giving effect to conflicts of laws principles that would result in the
application of the Law of any other state; provided, however, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties to this Agreement agrees
that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing
or the performance thereof shall be governed by the laws of the State of New
York.



Section 10.12. Enforcement; Exclusive Jurisdiction.



(a)The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement shall be
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, including the obligations to consummate the
Closing, the Seller Ancillary Agreements and the Buyer Ancillary Agreements,
in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction over such matter is vested in the federal courts, any
federal court located in the State of Delaware without proof of actual damages
or otherwise (and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties'
rights in this Section 10.12 are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby and each party hereby waives any objections to any remedy
referred to in this Section 10.12.



(b)In addition, each of the parties (i) consents to submit itself, and hereby
submits itself, to the personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or,
if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction, any state court of
the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction, in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue
in any such court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court other than the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware and any federal court located in the State of Delaware, or, if neither of such courts has subject matter jurisdiction,
any state court of the State of Delaware having subject matter jurisdiction,
and (iv) consents to service of process being made through the notice
procedures set forth in Section 10.6.



(c)Notwithstanding the foregoing Section 10.12(a) or Section 10.12(b), each of
the parties agrees that it will not bring or support any action of any kind or
description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or
otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including but not limited to any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance of the
transactions related thereto, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York located in the County of New York (and
appellate courts thereof), and makes the agreements, waivers and consents set
forth in Section 10.12(b) mutatis mutandis but with respect to the courts
specified in this Section 10.12(c).



Section 10.13. Waiver of Jury Trail. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT
HEREBY KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY ACTION
AGAINST THE DEBT FINANCING SOURCES ARISING OUT OF, OR RELATING TO, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE DEBT FINANCING.



Section 10.14. [Omitted].



Section 10.15. Confidential Nature of Information. Each party agrees that it
will treat in confidence all documents, materials and other information which
it shall have obtained regarding the other party or parties during the course
of the negotiations leading to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether obtained before or after the date of this
Agreement), the investigation provided for herein and the preparation of this
Agreement and other related documents, and, in the event the transactions
contemplated hereby shall not be consummated, each party will return to the
other party or parties all copies of nonpublic documents and materials which
have been furnished in connection therewith. Without limiting the right of
either party to pursue all other legal and equitable rights available to it
for violation of this Section 10.15 by the other party, it is agreed that
other remedies cannot fully compensate the aggrieved party for such a
violation of this Section 10.15 and that the aggrieved party shall be entitled
to injunctive relief to prevent a violation or continuing violation hereof.



Section 10.16. Disclaimer of Warranties. Neither Seller nor Tribune makes any
representations or warranties with respect to any projections, forecasts or
forward-looking information provided to Buyer. There is no assurance that any
projected or forecasted results will be achieved. EXCEPT AS TO THOSE MATTERS
EXPRESSLY COVERED BY THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE
SELLER ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS AND THE CERTIFICATES DELIVERED BY SELLER PURSUANT
TO SECTION 7.2, SELLER IS SELLING THE BUSINESS AND THE PURCHASED ASSETS ON AN
"AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS AND SELLER DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
REPRESENTATIONS AND GUARANTIES WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. SELLER MAKES NO
REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY AS TO MERCHANTABILITY, SUITABILITY OR FITNESS FOR
ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NO IMPLIED WARRANTIES WHATSOEVER. Buyer
acknowledges that neither Seller nor any of its representatives nor any other
Person has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, as to the
accuracy or completeness of any memoranda, charts, summaries or schedules
heretofore made available by Buyer or its representatives or Affiliates or any other information which
is not included in this Agreement or the Schedules hereto, and neither Seller
nor any of its representatives nor any other Person will have or be subject to
any liability to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any other Person resulting
from the distribution of any such information to, or use of any such
information by, Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer or any of their agents,
consultants, accountants, counsel or other representatives. In making its
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
Buyer and its Affiliates have relied solely on (a) the results of their own
independent investigation and (b) the representations and warranties of Seller
expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement and the Seller
Ancillary Agreements. Buyer and its Affiliates expressly and specifically
disclaim that they are relying upon or have relied upon any representation or
warranty of any kind or nature, whether express or implied, not included in
this Agreement or any Seller Ancillary Agreement that may have been made by
any Person, and acknowledge and agree that Seller expressly and specifically
disclaims any such other representations and warranties.



Section 10.17. Non-Recourse Against Debt Financing Sources; Waiver of Certain
Claims. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the parties hereto hereby agree that, subject to the rights of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates under any commitment letters and any definitive agreements
entered into in connection with the Debt Financing, no Debt Financing Source
shall have any liability to Seller or any of its Affiliates or any other
Person relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any of the Ancillary
Agreements or the Debt Financing, or any document related thereto (including
any willful breach thereof), or the failure of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby to be consummated), whether at law or equity, in contract or
in tort or otherwise, and neither Seller nor any of its respective Affiliates
shall have any rights or claims whatsoever against any of the Debt Financing
Sources under this Agreement, any of the Ancillary Documents or in connection
with the Debt Financing, whether at law or equity, in contract or in tort, or
otherwise. Seller hereby agrees, on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, that
none of the Debt Financing Sources shall have any liability or obligations to
Seller or any of its Affiliates relating to this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Agreements or any of the transactions contemplated herein or therein
(including with respect to the Debt Financing). Seller and its Affiliates
hereby waive any and all claims and causes of action (whether at law, in
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Debt Financing Sources
that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, any of the
Ancillary Agreements, any financing commitment or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby (including the Debt Financing). This Section
10.17 is intended to benefit and may be enforced by the Debt Financing Sources
and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of Seller.
