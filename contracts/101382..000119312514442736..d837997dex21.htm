CONSIDERATION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES

 

3.01. _Effect on Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the Merger and
without any action by the Company or any holder of Company Common Stock:

(a) _Company Common Stock_.

 

(1) Each Exchangeable Share as of the Effective Time will be converted into
and constitute the right to receive the " _Per Share Consideration_ ", which
equals the number of Shares equal to the sum of (x) the Exchange Ratio _PLUS_
(y) the Estimated Per Share Equity Adjustment Amount, _it being understood_
that the addition of a negative Estimated Per Share Equity Adjustment Amount
to the Exchange Ratio shall reduce the Per Share Consideration by the absolute
value of such negative Estimated Per Share Equity Adjustment Amount.

 

(2) Shares of Company Common Stock held in treasury by the Company shall be
cancelled (and, for clarity, no Per Share Consideration shall be payable in
respect of such shares).

(3) Shares of Company Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will
automatically be cancelled and will cease to exist; holders of Company Common
Stock will cease to be, and will have no rights as, stockholders of the
Company; and certificates that represented shares of Company Common
Stock prior to the Effective Time will be deemed for all purposes to
represent only the right to receive, without interest, the Per Share
Consideration.

 

(b) At and after the Effective Time, there will be no transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock on the stock transfer books of the Company or the
Surviving Company, and shares of Company Common Stock presented to the
Surviving Company or Purchaser will be cancelled and exchanged in accordance
with this ARTICLE III.

the Shares issuable to holders of Old Certificates under this ARTICLE III.

 



17 (b) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to each Shareholder a
form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Old Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of such certificates to the Exchange Agent) containing
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Old Certificates in
exchange for the Per Share Consideration.

 

(c) At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, each
Shareholder shall deliver each of his Old Certificates, with a duly completed
and validly executed letter of transmittal in the form, and in accordance with
the instructions, provided by the Exchange Agent, to the Exchange Agent.

 

(d) If any New Certificate is to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Old Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it will
be a condition to the exchange that the person requesting the exchange (i) pay
any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of the New
Certificate in a name other than the name of the registered holder of the
surrendered Old Certificate or (ii) establish to the satisfaction of Purchaser
(or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) that any such Taxes have been paid
or are not applicable.

 

(e) Promptly following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to deliver the New Certificates to the Shareholders in
accordance with this ARTICLE III.

3.03. _Fractional Shares_. No fractional Shares shall be issued to
any Shareholder in connection with this Agreement or as a result of the
Merger. Any such fractional Share due to a Shareholder shall be rounded up or
down to the nearest whole number of Shares.

changes (or the board of directors of Purchaser sets a related record date
that will occur before the Effective Time for a change in) the number or kind
of Shares outstanding by way of a stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, reclassification, reorganization or similar transaction, the
Exchange Ratio will be adjusted proportionately to account for such change.

3.05. _Estimated Per Share Equity Adjustment Amount_. At least ten (10)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to
Purchaser: (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Business Day that is (x) the
last Business Day of a calendar month preceding the calendar month in which
the Closing is scheduled to occur pursuant to Section 2.02 and (y) at least
twenty (20) days prior to the Closing Date (the " _Reference Date
Balance Sheet_ "), prepared in accordance with GAAP and on a basis consistent
with the accounting practices and policies used in the preparation of the
Company Financial Statements; and (ii) a certificate setting forth the
Companys projection, based on the Reference Date Balance Sheet, of the
Stockholders Equity as of the Closing Date,

 



18  consistent with the Companys past practices in preparing projections and
reflecting the methodology described in Section 3.06(a) below (the "
_Estimated Equity Amount_ "). The Company shall afford Purchaser and its
Representatives the opportunity to review all work papers and documentation
used by the Company in preparing the Reference Date Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Equity Amount.

 

3.06. _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable, but no later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be prepared and delivered to the
Sellers Representative a proposed final consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing Date
(the " _Closing Date Balance Sheet_ "), and a certificate based on such
Closing Date Balance Sheet setting forth Purchasers calculation of the
Stockholders Equity as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Final Equity Amount_ ", and together with the Closing Date Balance Sheet,
the " _True-Up Statement_ "). The Closing Date Balance Sheet shall be prepared
in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis that is consistent with the
preparation of the Company Financial Statements, including the use of the
same accounting principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods, with
consistent classifications, judgments, inclusions, exclusions and valuation
and estimation methodologies, that were employed in the preparation of
the Reference Date Balance Sheet, to the extent consistent with GAAP. For
clarity, and in accordance with GAAP, the Closing Date Balance Sheet shall (i)
to the extent completed as of the close of business on the Closing Date,
reflect the sale of the Designated Securities provided for in Section 6.10,
the transfer of the Pension Plan provided for in Section 6.11(a)(1), the
transfer of the Key Man Policies and related payment of cash provided for in
Section 6.11(a)(2), the transfer of the Company deferred compensation plan,
and the trust established in connection with such deferred compensation plan,
provided for in Section 6.11(a)(3), and the Companys payment or accrual of
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of the
Merger as provided for in Section 10.01 (including all fees payable to the
Companys financial advisor), (ii) not reflect transaction-related entries,
accruals or adjustments, such as purchase accounting adjustments, vendor or
funding termination penalties, management change-in-control or retention
payments, and employee severance costs, and (iii) include the same line items
reflected in the Reference Date Balance Sheet, to the extent consistent with
GAAP. In calculating the accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the
Closing Date Balance Sheet, the net unrealized gain (loss) on securities will
be determined using the same valuation agent and methodology used by the
Company in preparing the Company Financial Statements, to the extent
consistent with GAAP. Purchaser shall afford the Sellers Representative and
its Representatives the opportunity to review all work papers and
documentation used by Purchaser in preparing the True-Up Statement.

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the determination of the
True-Up Statement shall be final and binding on the parties hereto, unless,
within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Sellers Representative of such
True-Up Statement, the Sellers Representative shall notify Purchaser in
writing of its disagreement with any amount included therein or omitted
therefrom (each dispute, an " _Objection_ "), in which

 



19  case, if the parties are unable to resolve the Objections within ten (10)
Business Days of the receipt by Purchaser of notice of such disagreement, such
unresolved Objections shall be determined by a nationally recognized
independent accounting firm selected by mutual agreement between the Sellers
Representative and Purchaser (the " _Accounting Referee_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event the fees of the Accounting Referee as estimated

requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
covenants contained in ARTICLE IV or ARTICLE VI or one or more representations
or warranties contained in this ARTICLE V. The inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Letter as an exception to a representation or warranty will not by

to Purchaser and Merger Sub as follows:

qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign corporation in
each jurisdiction where the ownership or leasing of its assets or property or
the conduct of its business requires such qualification, except for any
failure to be so qualified that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the
Company. The Company has Previously Disclosed and made available to Purchaser
a complete and correct copy of the Companys Constituent Documents, each as
amended to the date hereof, and such Constituent Documents are in full force
and effect.

 



25 (2) Each Shareholder has full power, authority and legal capacity to enter
into this Agreement, to perform his obligations hereunder and to effect the

any preemptive rights). The Company does not have any Rights issued or
outstanding, any shares of Company Common Stock reserved for issuance or any
commitment to authorize, issue or sell any Company Common Stock or any Rights.

Common Stock, free and clear of any Liens or Adverse Rights, and
no authorization for any such Lien or Adverse Right has been given and (ii)
control one hundred percent (100%) of the voting power of the Company required
to vote on, or give its written consent to, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Common Stock other than the Shareholders commitments in Section 2.04.

bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations may be redeemed by it or any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have

outstanding equity securities of (and all the voting power in respect of)
each of its Subsidiaries free and clear of Liens or any Adverse Rights, and
all such equity securities have been duly authorized and are validly issued
and outstanding, fully paid and non-assessable (except, in the case
of Meridian Bank, National Association, as provided in 12 U.S.C. § 55 or
comparable state law in the case of Meridian Bank Texas). No equity securities
of any Company Subsidiary are or may become required to be issued (other than
to the Company or one of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) by reason of any
Right or otherwise. There are no Contracts, commitments, arrangements or
understandings by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is or may

control of the Company or its Subsidiaries or accountants (including all means
of access thereto and therefrom), except for any non-exclusive ownership and

(" _Owned Intellectual Property_ ") or is used by the Company or one or more
of its Subsidiaries pursuant to a valid, written license agreement ("
_Licensed_

 



32   _Intellectual Property_ "). All of the Companys and its Subsidiaries
rights to the Company Intellectual Property shall survive the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unchanged. Consummation of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not create
any rights authorizing third parties to use any Intellectual Property owned by
Purchaser or Purchasers Subsidiaries. The Company or its relevant Subsidiary
exclusively owns all right, title and interest in and to the Owned
Intellectual Property, free and clear of all Liens. The Owned Intellectual
Property is subsisting, valid and enforceable, and is not subject to any
outstanding order, judgment, decree or agreement materially and adversely
affecting the Companys use thereof or its rights thereto. The Company has
Previously Disclosed all Owned Intellectual Property that is
Registered and/or material to the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

(2) The conduct of the respective businesses of the Company and its
Subsidiaries does not, and in the past six (6) years has not, infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of any

Property right or, to the Sellers Knowledge, any rights of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries in any Licensed Intellectual Property.

used or held by the Company and its Subsidiaries, and, to the Companys
Knowledge, such Trade Secrets have not been used, disclosed to or discovered
by any person except pursuant to valid and appropriate non-disclosure and/or
license agreements which have not, to the Sellers Knowledge, been breached.
All Intellectual Property developed under Contract to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has been validly assigned to the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary or is otherwise owned by the Company or the applicable
Company Subsidiary.

(4) The IT Assets are in good working condition; have been properly
maintained by technically competent personnel in accordance with standards set
by the manufacturers or otherwise in accordance with standards prudent in the
industry to ensure proper operation, monitoring and use; operate and perform
in all material respects in accordance with their documentation and functional
specifications and otherwise as required by the Company and its Subsidiaries
in connection with their respective businesses; and have not materially
malfunctioned or failed within the past three (3) years. To the Sellers
Knowledge, the IT Assets do not contain any "time bombs", "Trojan horses",
"back doors", "trap doors", "worms", viruses, bugs, faults or other devices
or effects that (i) enable or assist any person to access without
authorization the IT Assets, or (ii) otherwise significantly adversely affect
the functionality of the IT Assets. 

 



33 (5) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has established and is in
compliance with a written information security program that includes
administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to safeguard the
security, confidentiality, and integrity of transactions and data. To the
Sellers Knowledge, no person has gained unauthorized access to the IT
Assets. The Company and its Subsidiaries have implemented backup, security and
disaster recovery technology and safeguards consistent with industry
practices. The Company and its Subsidiaries take reasonable measures, which
are adequate to comply with all Applicable Law and its contractual and privacy
commitments, to protect the confidentiality of customer financial and other
data. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has taken

the data and information necessary to the conduct of its business without
material disruption to, or material interruption in, the conduct of its
business.

 

(6) The Company has Previously Disclosed each item of Open Source Software
that is licensed or otherwise used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
The conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently
conducted does not violate any license terms applicable to any item of such
Open Source Software. No software contained in the Owned
Intellectual Property contains, is derived from, is distributed with or is
being or was developed using Open Source Software that is licensed under any
terms that impose or could impose a requirement or condition that any software
contained in the Owned Intellectual Property or part thereof: (i) be
disclosed or distributed in source code form; (ii) be licensed for the purpose
of making modifications or derivative works; or (iii) be redistributable at no
charge.

 

(u) _Taxes_.

 

(1) At all times since January 1, 1999 through the Closing Date, the Company

comparable provision of Applicable Law (the " _S Election_ ") and such S
Election has never been terminated or revoked. Since January 1, 2003, the
Company has not had any incorporated subsidiaries that were not "qualified
subchapter S subsidiaries" within the meaning of Section 1361(b)(3)(B) of the
Code and each such subsidiary was a qualified subchapter S subsidiary at all
times from either its incorporation or its acquisition by the Company through
the Closing Date. The S Election or the status of each incorporated subsidiary
as a qualified subchapter S subsidiary has not been the subject of any audit,
challenge or proceeding with any Governmental Entity. Since January 1, 2003,
the Company has not had any Subsidiary that was not incorporated that was not
disregarded as separate from its owner for federal Tax purposes and each such
Subsidiary was so disregarded at all times from either its formation or its
acquisition by the Company through the Closing Date. The Company has not been
required to recognize any net built-in gains of the Company and its
Subsidiaries within the meaning of Section 1374 of the Code other than (i)
$2,915,229 recognized due to an adjustment under Section 481(a) of the Code

 



34  due to a conversion from cash to accrual basis accounting and (ii)
$70,466,070 recognized in 2002. The net built-in gains described in clauses
(i) and (ii) of the preceding sentence were properly included in the Tax
Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries and all Taxes thereon were
properly and timely paid. Neither the Company nor any qualified subchapter S
subsidiary of the Company has, in the past ten (10) years, acquired assets
from another corporation in a transaction in which the Tax basis for the
acquired assets was determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the Tax
basis of the acquired assets in the hands of the transferor.

extensions of time within which to file) by or with respect to the Company

and accurate in all material respects. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is currently the beneficiary of any extension of time within
which to file any Tax Return.

or any of its Subsidiaries (whether or not shown to be due on the Tax Returns

(5) All deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of any audit or
examination by any Governmental Entity of the Tax Returns referred to in

the Companys Knowledge, no issues have been raised by any Governmental
Entity, or are expected to be raised by any directors or officers of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary based upon personal contact with any agent
of any Governmental Entity, in connection with any audit or examination of any
Tax Return and no such issues are currently pending.

 

(6) There are no pending, or threatened in writing, audits, examinations,
investigations or other Proceedings in respect of Taxes, Tax Returns or Tax
matters, in each case, with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
No written claim has been made within the past three (3) years by any
Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries does not file Tax Returns that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is or may be subject to any Tax imposed by that jurisdiction.

obligated to withhold from amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent
contractor, creditor, stockholder, customer, client, account holder, or other
third party have been withheld and paid over to the proper Governmental Entity
in a timely manner, to the extent due and payable.

 

(10) The Company and its Subsidiaries (i) collect and maintain appropriate IRS
Forms W-9 and W-8 and other required Tax forms, that are accurate and valid
in all material respects with respect to each customer, client, creditor or
other party in accordance with Applicable Law and (ii) have complied with all
material Tax information reporting requirements.

matters have been requested or given by any Tax authority or by any of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries which are currently in effect.

(12) The Company has made provisions in accordance with GAAP, in the Company
Financial Statements, for all non-income Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries that accrued on or before the end of the most recent period
covered by the Company Financial Statements.

 

(13) As of the date hereof, no Seller nor any Company Subsidiary has taken or
agreed to take any action or has any reason to believe that any conditions
exist that could prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 

(14) No Liens for Taxes exist with respect to any of the Companys assets or

Lien for Taxes upon such assets or properties.

 

(15) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required, as a

Subsidiaries.

(3) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code has been determined by the IRS to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code and, to the Sellers Knowledge, nothing has occurred that would

(including any contingent Liability) under, any "multiemployer plan" within

officer, employee, director, or independent contractor of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any material increase in severance
pay, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or materially increase
the amount of compensation due to any such employee, director, officer or

merge, materially amend, terminate or transfer the assets of any Company Plan
on or following the Effective Time, or (vi) give rise to the payment of any

individual with the right to, a gross-up, indemnification, reimbursement or
other payment for any excise or additional Taxes, interest, fines, fees or
penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code or due
to the failure of any payment to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

mechanics, workmens, repairmens, warehousemens, carriers or similar Liens
arising in the ordinary course, (iv) zoning, entitlement, building and
other land-use regulations imposed by Governmental Entities which are not
violated by the current use and operation of such property or which can be
insured over, (v) covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements and other

the risk of a complete loss of such Shareholders investment in such
securities.

and to provide Purchaser (or its Representatives) with financial or other
information (including audited financial information) with respect to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary on a timely basis as may be necessary or
desirable for Purchaser to include or incorporate in any Purchaser SEC Filings
or as may be needed in connection with any capital markets activities
conducted by Purchaser.

6.03. _Shareholder Covenants_.

 

(a) From the date hereof through the Closing, except as expressly provided in
this Agreement or as otherwise consented to in writing in advance by
Purchaser, each Seller agrees not to (i) Transfer any shares of Company Common
Stock controlled by him, (ii) exercise any of his voting rights with respect
to the Company to the extent such exercise would be contrary to the
provisions of this Agreement or would cause the Sellers to violate the
provisions of this Agreement, (iii) create any Lien or other Adverse Right in
respect of shares of Company Common Stock controlled by him, (iv) take any
action or fail to take any action that would cause or would be likely to
cause a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the Company or (v) take,
offer, propose or authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of, the
foregoing actions or inactions.

(b) Without the prior written consent of Purchaser, no Shareholder may
Transfer any Shares during the period commencing at the Closing and ending
six (6) months after the Closing Date. In the event of any purported Transfer
by any Shareholder of any Shares in violation of the provisions of this
Section 6.03, such purported Transfer shall be void and of no force or
effect, and Purchaser shall not give effect to such Transfer. Each Shareholder
also acknowledges that any Shares received pursuant to this Agreement shall be
subject to restrictions on sale imposed by the Securities Act, and
such Shareholder agrees to comply with any such restrictions.

6.04. _Regulatory Applications; Third-Party Consents_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers and Purchaser and the Companys and Purchasers
respective Subsidiaries will cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
prepare as promptly as practicable all documentation, to (i) make all filings,
and obtain all consents, approvals, permits and other authorizations of all
Governmental Entities, necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ ");
(ii) make all filings and to obtain all consents, approvals, permits and other
authorizations of all Governmental Entities necessary to consummate any
Related Transactions; and (iii) obtain all Required Third-Party Consents. Each
of the Company and Purchaser will have the right to review in advance, and to
the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject
to Applicable Law

 



54  relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all material
written information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals and the Required Third-
Party Consents, other than any information which is otherwise confidential. In
exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as
promptly as practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the
other party with respect to obtaining all material permits, consents,
approvals and authorizations of all third parties and Governmental Entities
necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and
each party will keep the other party apprised of the status of material
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) Each party will, upon request but subject to applicable confidentiality
requirements, furnish the other parties with all information concerning
itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and such other
matters as may be reasonably necessary, proper, desirable or advisable in
connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf
of such other party or any of its Affiliates with or to any third party or
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement:

 

(1) No Seller (nor any Company Subsidiary) shall amend, modify, supplement or
waive the terms and conditions of any Material Contract without the prior
written consent of Purchaser, nor shall any Seller or any Company Subsidiary,
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, pay or commit to pay to any
person whose consent, waiver or approval is being sought any cash or other
consideration, make any accommodation or commitment to incur any Liability or
other obligation to such person in connection with such consent, waiver or
approval; and

 

(2) Nothing shall require Purchaser to, and each Seller and Company Subsidiary
shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, agree to, take any
action or commit to take any action in connection with, or agree to any
condition on, or request with respect to, any Requisite Regulatory Approval or
Required Third-Party Consent that would (i) have any Material Adverse Effect
or (ii) constitute a Burdensome Condition.

6.05. _Press Releases_. Each Seller will consult with Purchaser
before issuing any press release, written employee communication or other
written stockholder communication with respect to the Merger or this Agreement
and will not issue any such communication or make any such public statement
without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser will consult with, and consider in
good faith the views of, the Company before issuing any press release, written
employee communication or other written stockholder communication with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such
communication or make any such public statement without prior consultation in
good faith with the Company. The Company and Purchaser will cooperate to
develop all public communications of the Company with respect to the Merger
or this Agreement and will make appropriate members of management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably
requested by the other party. 

 



55 6.06. _Acquisition Proposals_. Each Seller agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Representatives and Affiliates not to, and the Company will cause
its Subsidiaries Representatives and Affiliates not to, in each case directly
or indirectly, solicit or encourage, or engage in any negotiations concerning,
or provide any Confidential Information in connection with, or have any
discussions with any person relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make or implement an
Acquisition Proposal. Each Seller will immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any of the foregoing actions relating to an Acquisition Proposal
and will use its commercially reasonable efforts to enforce any
confidentiality or similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. The
Sellers Representative will within one (1) Business Day advise Purchaser
following receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and the substance thereof
(including the identity of the person making such Acquisition Proposal and, if
applicable, copies of any related written requests, expressions of interest,
proposals or offers, including proposed letters of intent, agreements or other
documents), and will keep Purchaser apprised of any related developments on a
current basis.

 

6.07. _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. The Company will not take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be subject to
requirements imposed by any Takeover Law and will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated hereby from, or if necessary challenge the validity
or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect.

6.08. _Access; Information_.

 

(a) Each Seller agrees that upon reasonable notice and subject to Applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information, it will (and the Company will
cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Purchaser, and Purchasers Representatives,
such access during normal business hours throughout the period before the
Effective Time to the books, records (including Tax Returns and work papers
of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other information
as Purchaser may reasonably request and, during such period, it will furnish
promptly to Purchaser (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed by it pursuant to the requirements of Applicable Law
respecting banking or securities, and (ii) all other information concerning
the business, properties and personnel of it as Purchaser may reasonably
request. Neither Purchaser nor any Seller will be required to afford access
or disclose information that would jeopardize attorney-client privilege. To
the extent possible, the parties will make appropriate substitute arrangements
in circumstances where the previous sentence applies. 

(b) No investigation by Purchaser of the business and affairs of any Seller,
pursuant to this Section 6.08 or otherwise, will affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to Purchasers obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



56 (c) Each party shall hold, and shall cause its respective Affiliates
and Representatives to hold, in strict confidence, except to the extent
necessary to discharge obligations pursuant to Section 6.04 or unless
compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or, based on the
advice of its counsel, by other requirements of Applicable Law or the
applicable Governmental Entity, all non-public records, books, contracts,
instruments, computer data and other data and information (each, whether oral
or written and collectively, " _Confidential Information_ ") concerning
Purchaser, in the case of the Sellers, and concerning the Company, in the case
of Purchaser, furnished to it by or on behalf of Purchaser, in the case of the
Sellers, or the Sellers, in the case of Purchaser, or, in each case, any
Affiliate or Representative thereof or otherwise in connection with the Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby and any related integration or
transition planning, _it_ _being_ _understood_ that each party and its
respective Affiliates and Representatives will use reasonable best efforts to
preserve the confidential treatment of such Confidential Information (except
to the extent that such Confidential Information can be shown to have
been (i) previously known by such party on a non-confidential basis, (ii)
independently developed by a party or its Representatives without use of
Confidential Information, (iii) in the public domain through no fault of such
party or (iv) later lawfully acquired from other sources, which are not
prohibited from disclosing such information by a known contractual, legal,
agency or fiduciary obligation, by the party to which it was furnished), and
shall not release or disclose such Confidential Information to any other
person, except its Representatives who (i) in its judgment need to know such
information for the purpose of evaluating, negotiating, or consummating the
Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) are informed by it of
the confidential nature of such information, and (iii) agree or are required
by internal policies or fiduciary or other legal obligations to keep such
information confidential, and, to the extent permitted above, any
Governmental Entity.

(d) At any time upon Purchasers written request, but in any event after the
Closing, each Seller shall destroy or cause to be destroyed, all Confidential
Information concerning Purchaser (and, following the Closing, all Confidential
Information concerning the Company) in the possession of such Seller or any of
its Affiliates and Representatives, and, if requested by Purchaser, the
Sellers Representative will deliver a certificate certifying compliance with
this provision on behalf of each of the Sellers. To the extent permitted by
Applicable Law, each party will notify the other party promptly upon becoming
aware that any of the Confidential Information has been disclosed to or
obtained by a third party (other than as permitted by this Section 6.08). If
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to its terms, each party agrees to
promptly destroy all Confidential Information in its and its Affiliates
possession and, if requested by another party, will deliver a certificate of a
senior officer (or the Sellers Representative, as applicable)
certifying compliance with this provision.

(e) Subject to its confidentiality obligations under this Section 6.08, each
party and each of its respective Representatives (i) may retain Confidential
Information of the other parties to the extent consistent with its compliance
or record-retention policies or procedures or any legal requirement or
standard and (ii) is not obligated to destroy any Confidential Information of
the other parties that may be contained in its electronic back-up systems
established for archival or disaster-recovery purposes.

 



57 (f) Except for the provisions of Section 6 thereof regarding non-
solicitation, which will survive according to its terms, the Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby terminated in its entirety and shall be of no further
force or effect.

 

6.09. _Supplemental Indentures_. At or before the Effective Time, Purchaser
will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, by or on
behalf of Purchaser, one or more supplemental indentures and other instruments
required for the due assumption of the Companys outstanding debt, guarantees,
securities, and (to the extent informed of such requirement by the Company)
other agreements to the extent required by the terms of such debt, guarantees,
securities or other agreements.

6.10.  _Designated Securities_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, or
shall cause any applicable Company Subsidiaries to, sell, liquidate or
otherwise dispose of any Designated Securities such that no Designated
Securities shall be held by the Company or any Company Subsidiary as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
obligated to take the actions required by this Section 6.10, (i) unless and
until the Company shall be satisfied that the conditions to the obligation of
the parties to consummate the Merger will be satisfied or waived on or before
the Closing Date, and (ii) in no event until two (2) days prior to the Closing
Date.

 

6.11. _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Shareholders and/or the Company
(including its Subsidiaries), as appropriate, shall take (or cause to be
taken) all actions reasonably determined by Purchaser to be necessary or
appropriate to (i) terminate, effective immediately prior to the Effective
Time, any Company Plans or the Companys (or any Company
Subsidiarys) participation in and liability for benefits under such plans
which will not be retained by Purchaser, (ii) amend any Company Plans intended
to be retained by Purchaser, or (iii) provide substantiation of the foregoing
or that other actions have been completed that are required to maintain
compliance with Applicable Law, including ERISA and the Code. Without limiting
the foregoing, the Sellers agree to take the following actions that are
intended to cause an entity that is neither the Company nor, immediately
after the Effective Time, an ERISA Affiliate of the Company to assume, retain,
or otherwise accept responsibility for the following benefit plans or programs
(the " _Retained Benefit Obligations_ "):

 

(1) To transfer sponsorship of the Marquette Financial Companies Pension
Account Plan (the " _Pension Plan_ ") prior to the Effective Time to an
entity that is neither the Company nor, immediately after the Effective Time,
an ERISA Affiliate of the Company, and to include in such transfer
documentation provisions reasonably acceptable to Purchaser indemnifying the
Company and its ERISA Affiliates (determined immediately after the Effective
Time) and their respective successors) from any Liability with respect to the
Pension Plan;

 



58 (2) To take all actions necessary or appropriate to transfer to an entity
that will not be an Affiliate of the Company immediately following the Merger
all right, title, and interest in and to each of those key man life insurance
policies identified in Section 6.11(a)(2) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter
(the " _Key Man Policies_ "), as well as those deferred compensation
agreements and obligations associated with such key man life insurance
policies, in exchange for a cash payment to the Company equal to the net book
value (defined as cash surrender value less deferred compensation
obligations) of the Key Man Policies, and to absolve, relieve and indemnify
the Company and its Subsidiaries (and respective successors) from any
Liability with respect to the Key Man Policies and related
deferred compensation agreements;

(3) To take all actions necessary or appropriate to (i) transfer to an entity
that will not be an Affiliate of the Company immediately following the Merger
the Company deferred compensation plan effective as of July 1, 1996 and the
trust established in connection with such deferred compensation plan, (ii)
require such transferee entity to administer the plan and the trust following
transfer in accordance with their respective terms and Applicable Law and
(iii) absolve, relieve and indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries (and
respective successors) from any Liability with respect to such trust and such
deferred compensation plan; and

(4) To take all actions necessary or appropriate to absolve, relieve and
indemnify the Company and its Subsidiaries (and respective successors) from
any Liability with respect to post-retirement medical coverage.

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries agree to provide group medical coverage
to their employees until the Effective Time in a manner reasonably expected
to avoid triggering a Tax or penalty under Section 4980H of the Code.

(c) Where applicable and except to the extent that it would result in
duplication of benefits, each Continuing Employee will receive full credit for
service with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries for purposes of determining
eligibility to participate and vesting under each employee benefit plan,
program, policy or arrangement to be provided by Purchaser to such Continuing
Employees to the same extent such service was recognized under the applicable
benefit plan immediately preceding the Effective Time. Purchaser shall
provide, or cause to be provided, severance in accordance with Schedule C
(such schedule to include (i) terms requiring the terminated employee to agree
to non-solicitation and non-disclosure covenants and (ii) such other terms
as Purchaser may reasonably determine) to each Continuing Employee whose
employment is terminated by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries without
"cause" (within the meaning set forth in Schedule C) within twelve (12) months
after the Closing Date, is subject to the execution, delivery and non-
revocation of a release of claims in favor of Purchaser and the Affiliates of
Purchaser.

 

(d) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall create any right of
an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who remains in the
employment of Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries following the Effective
Time (a " _Continuing Employee_ ") to employment or continued employment for
any specified period, of any nature or kind whatsoever, with Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries or create any third-

 



59  party beneficiary rights in any current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor of Purchaser, the Company or their
respective Subsidiaries in respect of employment or any other matter. Nothing
in this Agreement is intended to be, or shall be construed as, an amendment to
any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, policy or agreement.

 

(e) To the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the applicable
plan or arrangement, Purchaser shall amend any defined contribution plan
sponsored by Purchaser, as necessary, so that any Continuing Employee with an
outstanding participant loan under the defined contribution plan sponsored by
the Company or an ERISA Affiliate shall have the opportunity to elect an in-
kind rollover of the participant loan to Purchasers plan, provided that such
loan is determined to be in compliance with ERISA and the Code.

 

6.12. _Title Surveys and Environmental Assessments_.

 

(a) At Purchasers written request, the Company shall cause a Phase I
environmental assessment (" _Phase I Assessment_") to be performed (at
Purchasers expense) covering any property owned by the Company and specified
in Purchasers request. Any Phase I Assessment shall be prepared by an
environmental engineering firm mutually acceptable to the parties and shall
assess with a reasonable degree of certainty the presence or absence of any
Hazardous Materials and the potential costs in connection with any remedial
action with respect to any Hazardous Materials found on, under, at or within
the applicable property. The Company will provide Purchaser with a copy of any
Phase I Assessment performed. If any Phase I Assessment finds that any actions
are necessary to contain, clean up or remediate any Hazardous Materials, or
to bring any property of the Company into compliance with applicable
Environmental Laws or Applicable Law respecting zoning and building, the
parties shall discuss in good faith the appropriate manner of addressing such
findings.

 

(b) At Purchasers written request, the Company shall obtain title insurance
(at Purchasers expense) covering any property owned by the Company and
specified in Purchasers request. The Company will provide Purchaser a copy of
any title insurance policy obtained, including any report listing exceptions
from any such title insurance policy. If any requested title insurance cannot
be obtained, or can only be obtained with exceptions not customarily included
in title insurance available in the region where the property is located, the
parties shall discuss in good faith the appropriate manner of addressing such
inability to obtain customary insurance.

6.13. _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns and Amendments_.

 

(1) Purchaser shall timely prepare and file or cause to be filed with the
appropriate authorities all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Company
and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date, other than income and franchise
Tax Returns described in Section 6.13(a)(2) below. All such Tax Returns that

 



60  pertain to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be prepared on a basis consistent
with the past practice of the Company (except as otherwise required by
Applicable Law) and in a manner that does not distort Taxable income as
between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Tax periods beginning after the Closing
Date and the portion of any Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date
(a " _Post-Closing Tax Period_ ") (e.g., by deferring income or accelerating
deductions). Purchaser shall furnish a copy of any Tax Returns pertaining to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period to the Sellers Representative for its review and
comment at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Returns, including extensions. Purchaser shall take into account any
reasonable comments provided at least fifteen (15) business days prior to the
due date for filing such Tax Returns. Except as required by Applicable Law,
Purchaser shall not amend (and shall not permit any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) to amend) any income Tax Return
of the Company or its Subsidiaries relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(2) The Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, shall cause the
timely preparation and filing (or will provide to Purchaser for timely filing)
with the appropriate authorities all income and franchise Tax Returns required
to be filed by the Company and its Subsidiaries for Tax periods ending on or
before the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis
consistent with the past practice of the Company (except as otherwise required
by Applicable Law) and in a manner that does not distort Taxable income as
between Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Post-Closing Tax Periods (e.g., by
deferring income or accelerating deductions). The Sellers Representative, on
behalf of the Sellers, shall furnish such Tax Returns to Purchaser for
its review and filing at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date,
including extensions, for filing such Tax Returns. Seller shall take into
account any reasonable comments provided by Purchaser at least fifteen (15)
business days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return. Purchaser
shall timely file such Tax Returns as furnished, or otherwise approved in
writing, by Seller, except as otherwise required by Applicable Law. Purchaser
and the Shareholders agree to cause the Company to file all Tax Returns for
any Tax period including the Closing Date on the basis that the relevant Tax
period ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date, unless the
relevant Governmental Entity will not accept a Tax Return filed on that
basis.

(b) _Proration of Taxes_.

 

(1) With respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes that shall be treated as
attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as follows: (i)
to the extent such Tax is calculated on a basis other than income, profit,
receipts, or gains, such as property Tax, such Tax shall be prorated based on
the number of days in such Tax period up to and including the Closing Date,
except that any increase in Taxes that would not have occurred but for the
transactions

 



61  contemplated by this Agreement shall not be taken into account and (ii) to
the extent such Tax is measured by income or receipts or otherwise not
described in clause (i), above, such Tax shall be allocated based on a
closing of the books on the Closing Date with respect to the Company.

(2) In the case of Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period,
the portion of any such Taxes that shall be treated as attributable to a Post-
Closing Tax Period shall be all such Taxes other than the Taxes attributable
to a Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to Section 6.13(b)(1) hereof.

(c) _Cooperation_. Each of the Sellers, the Sellers Representative and
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, officers, employees, agents, auditors and Representatives
reasonably to cooperate, in preparing and filing all Tax Returns, including
maintaining and making available to each other all records necessary in
connection with Taxes and in resolving all disputes and audits with respect to
all Tax periods relating to Taxes. Purchaser and the Sellers recognize that
each of the Shareholders and their respective Affiliates will need access,
from time to time, after the Closing Date, to certain accounting and Tax
records and information held by the Company to the extent such records and
information pertain to events occurring prior to the Closing Date; therefore,
Purchaser agrees to, and agrees to cause the Surviving Company to (i) use
their respective best efforts to properly retain and maintain such records
until such time as the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders,
agrees that such retention and maintenance is no longer necessary, and (ii)
allow each of the Shareholders and their respective agents and Representatives
(and agents or Representatives of any of their respective Affiliates), at
times and dates mutually acceptable to the parties, to inspect, review and
make copies of such records as such Shareholder may deem necessary or
appropriate from time to time, such activities to be conducted during normal
business hours and at such Shareholders expense. In the event that a
Governmental Entity determines that the Company at any time prior to the
Closing Date failed to qualify as an S-corporation, the Sellers shall take
such curative measures as reasonably requested by Purchaser in order to
mitigate any adverse consequences relating to such a failure.

(d) _Shareholders  Liability for Taxes_. The Shareholders shall jointly and
severally indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates
from, against, and in respect of any Losses incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, any such indemnified party based upon, arising out of, with
respect to or by reason of: (i) Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries
with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) any breach of or inaccuracy in
any representation, warranty or covenant contained in Section 5.02(u) and this
Section 6.13 ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that for purposes of this Section
6.13(d), in determining the amount of any Losses in respect of a breach of any
such representation or warranty, any qualifications relating to materiality
(including Material Adverse Effect) or Knowledge contained in any such
representation or warranty shall be disregarded); (iii) Transfer Taxes for
which the Shareholders are responsible pursuant to Section 6.13(f); (iv)
without duplication, Taxes directly or indirectly arising from, related to or
attributable to the breach or nonperformance of any covenant or agreement of
the Sellers contained in this Agreement; and (v) without limitation on clauses
(i) through (iv)

 



62  of this Section 6.13(d), any Taxes attributable to failure to properly
withhold Tax from any payment and/or failure to pay any amount required to be
withheld to a Governmental Entity, or to properly report any Tax item to a
Governmental Entity, in each case, to the extent such failure (A) arises as a
result of reliance by Purchaser, the Surviving Company or the Company
Subsidiaries on the Tax forms, client information and information reporting
methodologies maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of the Closing
Date and (B) occurs prior to the first (1st) anniversary of the Closing Date,
in each case except to the extent such Taxes were taken into account in
calculating the Estimated Equity Amount or Final Equity Amount to which the
Shareholders are entitled.

 

(e) _Procedures Relating to Indemnification of Tax Claims_.

 

(1) If a claim shall be made by any Governmental Entity, which, if successful
might result in an indemnity payment by the Shareholders to Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates under Section 6.13(d) (a " _Tax Claim_ "), Purchaser shall
promptly notify the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, of
such Tax Claim in writing and in reasonable detail. Failure to provide such
notice shall not limit the right of Purchaser and its Affiliates to be
indemnified under Section 6.13(d), except to the extent the Shareholders
ability to participate as to such Tax Claim is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby.

(2) With respect to any Tax Claim with respect to income or franchise Taxes
relating to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date, the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, shall control all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) and,
without limiting the foregoing, may in its sole discretion pursue or forego
any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with
any Governmental Entity with respect thereto, and shall either, in its sole
discretion, pay the Tax claimed and sue for a refund on behalf of the
Shareholders where Applicable Law permits such refund suits, or contest the
Tax Claim in any permissible manner; _provided_ that (i) Purchaser may at its
own expense participate in the Proceedings related to such Tax Claim, (ii)
the Shareholders shall keep Purchaser reasonably and timely informed with
respect to the commencement, status and nature of such Tax Claim, (iii) the
Shareholders shall consider any reasonable comments proposed by
Purchaser that are related to the defense of such Tax Claim and (iv) the
Shareholders shall not settle, compromise or dispose of such Tax Claim without
the consent of Purchaser, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

 

(3) With respect to any Tax Claim relating to a Straddle Period, Purchaser
shall have the right to control all Proceedings and may make any decisions in
connection with any Tax Proceeding related to such Straddle Period; _provided_
, _however_ , that (i) the Sellers Representative on behalf of each
Shareholder may at the Shareholders expense participate in the Proceedings
related to such Tax Claim, if permitted by the Governmental Entity, (ii)
Purchaser shall keep the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the

 



63  Shareholders, reasonably and timely informed with respect to the
commencement, status and nature of such Tax Claim, and (iii) Purchaser shall
not settle, compromise or dispose of such Tax Proceeding without the prior
written consent of the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

(4) With respect to any Tax Claim not described in Section 6.13(e)(2) or (3),
Purchaser shall have the right to control all Proceedings and may make any
decisions in connection with such Tax Claim; _provided_ that (i) Purchaser
shall not settle, compromise or dispose of a Tax Claim with respect to a Pre-
Closing Tax Period for which the Shareholders may be liable under this
Section 6.13 without consent of the Sellers Representative, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and (ii) Purchaser shall
not settle, compromise or dispose of such Tax Claim in a manner that would
either (x) shift income from a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or (y) shift deductions from a Pre-Closing Tax Period to a Post-Closing
Tax Period, without the consent of the Sellers Representative, on behalf of
the Shareholders, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

(5) Purchaser and the Company and each of their respective Affiliates shall
cooperate with the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, in
contesting any Tax Claim, which cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon any request of the Sellers Representative) the provision to the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, of records and information that
are reasonably relevant to such Tax Claim, and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information or explanation of
any material provided hereunder or to testify at proceedings relating to such
Tax Claim.

(f) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, value-added,
registration and other such Taxes (including all applicable real estate
transfer or gains Taxes) and related fees (including any penalties, fines,
interest and additions to Tax) incurred in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the
Shareholders and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser, and the Shareholders shall
file all appropriate Tax Returns as may be required with respect to such
Taxes. The Shareholders and Purchaser shall cooperate in timely making all Tax
Returns as may be required to be filed in the preceding sentence.

 

(g) _FIRPTA Matters_. At the Closing, each Shareholder shall deliver to
Purchaser a customary certificate reasonably acceptable to Purchaser and in
conformation with the Treasury Regulations under Section 1445 of the Code to
the effect that such Shareholder is not a foreign person.

 



64 (h) _Survival; Interaction with ARTICLE VII_. The representations
and warranties in Section 5.02(u) and the indemnification obligations
pursuant to this Section 6.13 shall survive the Closing until sixty (60) days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including
any extensions thereof) relevant to each particular item, including any
indemnification obligation arising from a breach of the representations and
warranties; _provided_ that if notice of indemnification under Section
6.13(e)(1) is provided to the indemnifying party prior to any such expiration
date, any obligation to indemnify for any claim described in such notice shall
continue indefinitely until such claim is finally resolved. Indemnification
for Losses with respect to the matters set forth in Section 6.13(d) shall be
governed solely by this Section 6.13 and the provisions of ARTICLE VII (other
than Section 7.01(a)(2)) shall not be applicable to indemnification with
respect to Taxes.

 

(i) _Amounts Payable_. As more specifically described in the following
sentence, the Shareholders shall pay all amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 6.13 promptly following receipt from Purchaser of a claim for a Loss
that is the subject of indemnification hereunder. In any event, the
Shareholders shall pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for which it is liable
hereunder no later than ten (10) Business Days following any Final
Determination of such Loss and the indemnifying partys liability therefor. A
" _Final Determination_ " shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute
have reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction
shall have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment or (iii)
an arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable
determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit
thereto. Except as otherwise required by Applicable Law, all payments made by
the Shareholders in respect of any claim pursuant to Section 6.13(d) shall be
treated as adjustments to the consideration for the Merger for Tax purposes.

6.14.  _Further Assurances_. The parties agree that, from time to time,
whether before, on or after the Closing Date, each of them will execute and
deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such
other action as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes and
intents of this Agreement.

6.15. _Sellers Representative_.

 

(a) Each of the Sellers hereby irrevocably appoints James O. Pohlad as its
representative (the " _Sellers Representative_ ") for all purposes under this
Agreement, including for the purposes of making or accepting any notice,
request, election, proposal, waiver or consent under or in respect of, or
amendment or modification to this Agreement (including pursuant to Section
10.03). Purchaser shall be entitled in its sole discretion to rely absolutely
upon and act in accordance with, without any Liability to any party for having
relied or acted thereon, notices, including requests, elections, proposals,
waivers, consents, amendments or information, issued by the Sellers
Representative. Service of any notice or other communication to the Sellers
Representative shall be deemed to constitute valid service or notice thereof
to each of the Sellers and notice or other communications from the Sellers
Representative shall be deemed to constitute valid service or notice from each
of the Sellers. The Sellers Representative shall be obliged to keep the
Sellers fully informed. Each Seller ratifies and confirms everything done in
such Sellers name by the Sellers Representative under this Agreement and
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser against all Liabilities in
respect of actions taken 

 



65  by the Sellers Representative and actions taken by Purchaser in reliance on
this Section 6.15 or on actions taken by the Sellers Representative. For
clarity, a decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers
Representative shall be deemed a decision, act, consent or instruction of all
the Sellers and will be final and binding upon each Seller, and Purchaser may
fully and unquestionably rely upon any such decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers Representative.

(b) Each of the Shareholders hereby duly appoints the Sellers
Representative as its attorney with full power to execute, complete and
deliver in the name and on behalf of such Seller all documents necessary to
give effect to the provisions of this Agreement, including the exercise of
power to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from
Purchaser and/or the Exchange Agent relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions and other matters contemplated hereby (except to the extent that
this Agreement expressly contemplates that any such notice or communication
shall be given or received by such holders individually), (ii) authorize the
payment to Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, payment
in satisfaction of indemnification claims by Purchaser or any other Purchaser
Indemnified Party pursuant to ARTICLE VII and Section 6.13 (including by not
objecting to such claims), (iii) agree to, object to, negotiate, resolve,
enter into settlements and compromises of, demand litigation of, and comply
with orders of courts with respect to (x) indemnification claims by Purchaser
or any other Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to ARTICLE VII and Section
6.13 or (y) any dispute between any Purchaser Indemnified Party and any
Seller, in each case relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iv) execute and deliver amendments, modifications,
waivers and consents, or otherwise waive or refrain from exercising any right
of any Seller, in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, and (v) take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The appointment in this Section 6.15(b) is
irrevocable and is given to secure the performance of the obligations of each
Seller under this Agreement.

 

(c) In the event of death or incapacity of the Sellers Representative, the
Sellers agree that Robert C. Pohlad shall be deemed for all purposes under
this Agreement as the Sellers Representative. If Robert C. Pohlad is unable to
serve as the Sellers Representative, the Sellers agree to appoint a successor
from their number within thirty (30) days after the date of the Sellers
Representatives death or incapacity.

6.16. _Conversion into Limited Liability Companies_. Prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall have converted, or shall have caused to be converted,
each of its corporate Subsidiaries (other than Meridian Bank, National
Association, Meridian Bank Texas and Marquette Capital Trusts I, II, III and
IV) into a Delaware limited liability company that is disregarded as an
entity separate from its owner for U.S. federal income Tax purposes.

6.17. _Non-Competition and Non-Solicitation_

(a) During the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
(2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Non-Competition Period_ "), the
Shareholders

 



66  shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly,
engage in the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (any such
business, a " _Competing Business_ ") in the Designated Markets; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitations of this Section 6.17(a) shall not apply to
control of up to ten percent (10%) of the outstanding securities of any entity
(i) the securities of which are listed and traded on a nationally recognized
securities exchange or market and (ii) that is engaged in the Competing
Business, as long as the Shareholders and/or their respective Affiliates do
not otherwise control such entity; _provided further_ , that the restrictions
set forth in this Section 6.17(a) shall not apply to (x) Marquette Capital,
LLC, Marquette Capital Fund I, LP, Marquette Capital Fund II, LP, Marquette
Capital Partners, LLC, and Marquette Capital Partners II, LLC, in each case,
to the extent such entities are engaged in a Competing Business as of the date
hereof, or (y) the activities of Affiliates of the Shareholders set forth in
Section 6.17 of the Sellers Disclosure Letter.

(b) During the Non-Competition Period, the Shareholders shall not, and shall
cause their Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment
or hire any Continuing Employee; _provided_ that this Section 6.17(b) shall
not prohibit (i) solicitation by means of a general purpose advertisement not
specifically targeted at the Continuing Employees or hiring any Continuing
Employee as a result of such general purpose advertisement or (ii) hiring any
Continuing Employee who was terminated by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
after the Closing Date.

 

(c) During the Non-Competition Period, the Shareholders shall not, and shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i) use any
information regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to solicit or
engage in other efforts directed to or targeted at any customer or customers
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to providing services
similar to those provided to such customers by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary as of the Closing Date or (ii) use such information to take any
other actions that are designed to induce any customer of the Company or
of any Company Subsidiary to transfer any portion of such customers
relationships with Purchaser to a similar business of a Shareholder or any of
their respective Affiliates; _provided_ that nothing in this Section 6.17(c)
shall be construed as limiting the ability of the Shareholders and their
Affiliates to respond to unsolicited requests by customers of the Company or
of any Company Subsidiary.

 

(d) Each of the Shareholders acknowledges that (i) as between the Shareholders
and the Company, the Company owns all trademarks, service marks, trade dress,
trade names, and domain names consisting of or incorporating the terms set
forth in Section 6.17(d) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter (collectively, the "
_Company Marks_ "), and (ii) no Shareholder has any rights, or is acquiring
any rights, to use the Company Marks after the Closing Date. No Shareholder
may use any Company Marks after the Closing Date, except that the Shareholders
may at all times after the Closing Date retain records and other historical
or archived documents containing or referencing the Company Marks.

 



67 (e) Each of the Shareholders understands and acknowledges that (i) it
would be difficult to calculate damages to Purchaser from any breach of the
obligations of the Shareholders under this Section 6.17, (ii) injury to
Purchaser from any such breach would be irreparable and impossible to measure
and (iii) the remedy under Applicable Law for any breach or threatened breach
of this Section 6.17 would therefore be an inadequate remedy and, accordingly,
Purchaser shall, in addition to all other available remedies (including
seeking such damages as it can show it has sustained by reason of such breach
and/or the exercise of all other rights it has under this Agreement), be
entitled to seek injunctive relief, specific performance and other equitable
remedies without the necessity of showing actual damages or posting bond.

(f) Each of the Shareholders understands and acknowledges that the restrictive
covenants and other agreements contained in this Section 6.17 are an
essential part of this Agreement. It is the intention of the parties that, if
any of the restrictions or covenants contained herein are held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time that is not permitted by
Applicable Law, or is in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such provision shall not be construed to be null, void and of no
effect, but to the extent that such provision would then be valid or
enforceable under Applicable Law, such provision shall be construed and
interpreted or reformed to provide for a restriction or covenant having the
maximum enforceable geographic area, time period and other provisions as shall
be valid and enforceable under Applicable Law.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, none of the restrictions imposed by
applicable subsections of this Section 6.17 shall apply to any person that is
an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement if such person ceases to be an
Affiliate of such party.

 

6.18. _Representatives  Fees_.

 

Prior to the Closing, all fees or other payments due to any Representatives of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in respect of the Merger or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be fully paid or fully accrued on the
Companys or the applicable Company Subsidiarys financial accounts.

 

6.19. _Company Marks_.

 

Following the date hereof, and prior to the Closing, the parties agree to
discuss in good faith a mutually agreeable arrangement pursuant to which
Affiliates of the Shareholders will be permitted to use, on a basis and for a
period to be discussed, certain of the Company Marks currently in use by such
Affiliates following the Closing Date.

Statements), 5.02(o)(ii) and (iv), 5.02(x)(1) (but only the first sentence

shall, subject to the express terms thereof, survive the Closing indefinitely.

(c) Each of the representations and warranties in ARTICLE V is separate and,
unless otherwise specifically provided, is not limited by reference to any
other representation or warranty or any other provision in this Agreement.

 

7.02. _Indemnification of Shareholders and Company Directors and Officers by
Purchaser_.

 

(a) Without limiting any right to indemnification available to any person by
Contract or Applicable Law, following the Effective Time, Purchaser will
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Shareholders, their Affiliates, the
present directors and officers (when acting in such capacity) of the Company
and their respective agents, heirs, successors and permitted assigns (each, a
" _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") against all Losses resulting from, arising out
of or incurred in connection with:

 

(1) any failure of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser that is
referred to in:

 

(a) Sections 7.01(a)(1); or

 

(b) Section 7.01(a)(3);

 

in each case, to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or as
of, and as if made on, the Closing Date; _it_ _being_   _understood_ that for
purposes of this Section 7.02(a)(1), in determining the amount of any Losses
in respect of the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true
and correct as of any particular date, any qualifications relating to
materiality (including Material Adverse Effect) or Knowledge contained in any
such representation or warranty shall be disregarded;

 



69 (2) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by
Purchaser in this Agreement; and

(3) any Third-Party Claim arising out of the conduct of the business by
Purchaser or the Company after the Effective Time except to the extent the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnity with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 7.03.

 

(b) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that portion of
directors and officers Liability insurance that serves to reimburse the
present and former officers and directors of the Company or of any of its
Subsidiaries (determined as of the Effective Time) with respect to claims
against such directors and officers arising from facts or events which
occurred before the Effective Time, which insurance shall contain at least the
same coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous, as that coverage currently provided by the Company; _provided_
_,_ that in no event shall Purchaser be required to expend more than two
hundred percent (200%) of the current amount expended by the Company (the "
_Current Premium_ ") to maintain or procure such directors and officers
insurance coverage for a comparable six (6)-year period; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that if Purchaser is unable to maintain or obtain the insurance
called for by this Section 7.02(b), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Current
Premium; _provided_ , _further_ , that officers and directors of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary may be required to make application and provide
customary representations and warranties to the responsible insurance carrier
for the purpose of obtaining such insurance. In lieu of this Section 7.02(b),
the Company may and at the request of Purchaser shall, in each case in
consultation with and only with Purchasers prior written consent, obtain at
or prior to the Effective Time a six (6)-year "tail" policy under the
Companys existing directors and officers insurance policy providing
equivalent coverage to that described in this Section 7.02(b) if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, on an annual basis,
does not exceed the Current Premium.

 

(c) The Seller Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.02(a)(1)(b) after the first (1st)
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ that if on or prior to such date,
a notice of claim shall have been given to Purchaser pursuant to Section
7.04 hereof for such indemnification, the Seller Indemnified Parties shall
continue to have the right to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.02
with respect to the matter or matters to which such claim relates until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved.

(d) Any indemnification of a Seller Indemnified Party pursuant to this
Section 7.02 shall be effected by wire transfer or transfers of immediately
available funds from Purchaser to an account or accounts designated by the
applicable Seller Indemnified Party in writing to Purchaser within five (5)
Business Days after the determination thereof.

 



70 (e) The provisions of this Section 7.02 shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Seller Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

 

7.03. _Indemnification of Purchaser by Shareholders_.

 

(a) Without limiting any right to indemnification available to any person by
Contract or Applicable Law, following the Effective Time, the Shareholders
shall, jointly and severally, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser and its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees,
shareholders, agents, heirs, successors and permitted assigns, each in their
capacity as such (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ "), against all
Losses resulting from, arising out of or incurred in connection with:

 

(1) any failure of any representation or warranty made by any Seller that is
referred to in:

 

(a) Section 7.01(a)(1); or

 

(b) Section 7.01(a)(3);

 

in each case, to be true and correct as of the date of this Agreement or as
of, and as if made on, the Closing Date; _it_ _being_   _understood_ that for
purposes of this Section 7.03(a)(1), in determining the amount of any Losses
in respect of the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true
and correct as of any particular date, any qualifications relating to
materiality (including Material Adverse Effect) or Knowledge contained in any
such representation or warranty shall be disregarded;

 

(2) any nonfulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement made by any
Seller or the Sellers Representative in this Agreement;

(3) any Liability of the Company to the Shareholders or to any Affiliate of
the Shareholders (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) existing as
of, or related to the period prior to, the Closing Date;

(4) any Liability of the Shareholders or any Affiliate of the Shareholders;

(5) any actions taken by the Sellers Representative or actions taken by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates in reliance on Section 6.15 or on any other
act, consent, decision notice, instructions or action of the Sellers
Representative, including any distributions to Sellers made by or at the
direction of the Sellers Representative; and

the Pension Plan in accordance with Section 6.11), and (ii) the
"multiemployer plan" identified in Section 5.02(x)(5) of the Sellers
Disclosure Letter, in each case of (i) or (ii) regardless of whether a
Liability arose prior to, at or after the Effective Time, and (iii) any
Liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to (x) a breach by
the Company of the terms of any of the Payout Agreements identified in Section
5.02(n) of the Sellers Disclosure Letter or (y) Section 409A of the Code in
connection with such Payout Agreements, in each case of (x) or (y), to the
extent such Liability relates to the Companys or any Company Subsidiarys
acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Any indemnification of a Purchaser Indemnified Party pursuant to
this Section 7.03 shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available
funds in an amount equal to the amount of the indemnification payment to an
account designated by the applicable Purchaser Indemnified Party in writing to
the Sellers Representative within five (5) Business Days after the
determination thereof.

(c) The Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to assert any
indemnification pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(1)(b) after the first anniversary
of the Closing Date; _provided_ that if on or prior to such date a notice of
claim shall have been given to the Sellers Representative pursuant to Section
7.04 hereof for such indemnification, the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall
continue to have the right to be indemnified pursuant to this Section 7.03
with respect to the matter or matters to which such claim relates until such
claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved.

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.03 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Purchaser Indemnified Party and its successors and Representatives.

 

7.04. _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

 

(a) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under this ARTICLE VII in respect of, arising
out of or involving a claim or demand made by any person (other than a party
hereto or Affiliate thereof) against the indemnified party (a " _Third-Party
Claim_ "), such indemnified party shall notify the indemnifying party in
writing, and in reasonable detail (taking into account the information then
available to such indemnified party), of the Third-Party Claim promptly after
receipt by such indemnified party of written notice of the Third-Party Claim;
_provided_ , _however_ , that failure to give such notification shall not
affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. The indemnified party shall deliver to the
indemnifying party, promptly after the indemnified partys receipt thereof,
copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the
indemnified party relating to the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the failure to deliver such copies shall not affect the indemnification
provided hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 



72 (b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an indemnified party, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate in the defense thereof (at
its expense) and, if it so chooses, within ten (10) days of receiving notice
of such claim acknowledges without reservation its obligation to indemnify the
indemnified party therefor and furnishes acceptable evidence of the resources
necessary to properly defend such matter, to assume the defense thereof (at
its expense) with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and satisfactory
to the indemnified party;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the indemnifying
party shall not have the right to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim
that (i) is a criminal claim or involves any allegations of criminal
wrongdoing or fraud, (ii) is a claim by a Governmental Entity or involves an
alleged violation of Applicable Law, (iii) seeks injunctive or other non-
monetary relief, (iv) is, in the case of Purchaser, material to Purchaser or
the Surviving Company, or (v) relates to the period after the Closing.

(c) Should the indemnifying party have the right to assume the defense of a
Third-Party Claim and elect to so assume the defense of such Third-Party
Claim, the indemnifying party will not be liable to the indemnified party for
legal expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection
with the defense thereof, unless the Third-Party Claim involves potential
conflicts of interest or different defenses for the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party. If the indemnifying party assumes such defense, the
indemnified party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof
and to employ counsel, at its own expense (except as provided in the
immediately preceding sentence), separate from the counsel employed by the
indemnifying party, _it_ _being_ _understood_ that the indemnifying
party shall control such defense. If the indemnified party reasonably
determines (i) that the indemnifying party failed or is failing to adequately
prosecute or defend any Third-Party Claim for which it has assumed the
defense, (ii) that the conduct of the defense of any claim subject to
indemnification hereunder or any proposed settlement of any such claim by the
indemnifying party might be expected to affect adversely the indemnified
partys Tax Liability or (in the event the indemnified party is a Purchaser
Indemnified Party) the ability of Purchaser to conduct its business, or (iii)
that the indemnified party may have available to it one or more defenses or
counterclaims that are inconsistent with one or more of those that may be
available to the indemnifying party in respect of such claim or any litigation
thereto, then the indemnified party may revoke the ability of the indemnifying
party to control the defense of such claim and may, itself, assume
the defense of such Third-Party Claim, at the expense of the indemnifying
party. The indemnifying party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the indemnified party for any period during which the
indemnifying party has not assumed the defense thereof and as otherwise
contemplated by clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above.

(d) If the indemnifying party chooses to defend any Third-Party Claim, all
the parties shall reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof.
Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the indemnifying
partys reasonable request) the provision to the indemnifying party of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third-Party
Claim, and use of all reasonable efforts to make employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder. Whether or not the indemnifying party
shall have assumed the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the indemnified party
shall

 



73  not admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge,
such Third-Party Claim without the indemnifying partys prior written consent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).
The indemnifying party may pay, settle or compromise a Third-Party Claim
without the written consent of the indemnified party, so long as such
settlement (i) includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party
from all Liability in respect of such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not subject
the indemnified party to any injunctive relief or other equitable remedy or
any other obligation other than solely the payment of monetary damages for
which the indemnified party will be indemnified hereunder, and (iii) does not
include a statement or admission of fault, culpability or failure to act by or
on behalf of the indemnified party.

 

(e) If an indemnified party shall desire to assert any claim for
indemnification provided for under this ARTICLE VII other than a claim in
respect of, arising out of or involving a Third-Party Claim, such indemnified
party shall notify the indemnifying party in writing, and in reasonable detail
(taking into account the information then available to such
indemnified party), of such claim promptly after becoming aware of the
existence of such claim; _provided_ that the failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided for hereunder except to the
extent the indemnifying party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced as a result of such failure. If the indemnifying party does not
respond to such notice within forty-five (45) days after its receipt, it will
have no further right to contest the validity or amount of such claim.

(f) The parties agree that the Sellers Representative shall act in all
respects under this ARTICLE VII as the Seller Indemnified Party and
indemnifying party on behalf of the Shareholders.

7.05. _Limitations on Indemnification_.

(a) The Shareholders shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(1) if the Loss associated with such claim is less
than seven thousand five hundred dollars ($7,500) (any such claim being
referred to as a " _De Minimis Claim_ "). The Shareholders shall have no
Liability for indemnification pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(1)(b) with respect
to Losses for which indemnification is provided thereunder unless the
aggregate amount of such Losses (including all Losses associated with De
Minimis Claims) exceeds one million dollars ($1,000,000) (the " _Indemnity
Threshold_ "), in which case the Shareholders shall be liable for all Losses
(excluding all Losses associated with De Minimis Claims); _provided_ that in
no event shall the aggregate indemnification to be paid by the Shareholders
(i) pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(1)(b) exceed forty million dollars
($40,000,000) or (ii) pursuant to Section 7.03(a)(1)(a) exceed two hundred
million dollars ($200,000,000).

 

(b) Purchaser shall have no Liability for any claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 7.02(a)(1) if the Loss is associated with any De Minimis
Claim. Purchaser shall have no Liability for indemnification pursuant to
Section 7.02(a)(1)(b) with respect to Losses for which indemnification is
provided thereunder unless the aggregate amount of such Losses (including all
Losses associated with De Minimis Claims) exceeds the Indemnity Threshold, in
which case Purchaser shall be liable for all Losses (excluding all Losses
associated with De Minimis Claims); _provided_ that in no event shall
the aggregate indemnification to be paid by Purchaser (i) pursuant to Section
7.02(a)(1)(b) exceed forty million dollars ($40,000,000) or (ii) pursuant to
Section 7.02(a)(1)(a) exceed two hundred million dollars ($200,000,000).

 



74 (c) The limitations specified in Sections 7.05(a)7.05(b) shall not apply in
respect of fraudulent breaches of representations and warranties or willful
concealment of any matter which breaches a representation or warranty.

 

(d) No indemnified party shall be entitled to recover from an indemnifying
party more than once in respect of the same Losses. 

7.06. _Indemnity Payments_. All payments made pursuant to this ARTICLE VII
(other than interest payments) shall be treated by the parties on all Tax
Returns as adjustments to the consideration for the Merger.

7.07. _Insurance; Recoveries_. The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder shall be calculated net of any insurance proceeds or
other payments actually received by the indemnified party from any insurer or
other third party on account of such Loss (as reduced by any
related retrospective or prospective increase in premiums and taking into
account all costs and expenses reasonably incurred in procuring such proceeds
or payments, and any Taxes paid or payable as a result of the receipt of such
proceeds or payments). The indemnified party shall be under no obligation to
pursue any insurance claim with respect to a matter for which such party is
claiming indemnity under this Agreement if the indemnified party reasonably
believes the cost of pursuing such insurance claim, including any increase in
premium related thereto, would be greater than the potential recovery. To the
extent that the indemnified party pursues an insurance claim and the costs
related thereto (as described in the parenthetical above) exceed the
insurance proceeds, the excess will be treated as a Loss. If the amount of any
Loss suffered by any indemnified party is reduced, at any time subsequent to
any payment in respect thereof by an indemnifying party pursuant to recovery
from any insurer or other third party on account of such Loss, an amount
equal to the amount of such reduction (not to exceed, in any event, the amount
so previously paid in respect thereof by the indemnifying party), less any
costs incurred in obtaining such recovery, shall either promptly be repaid by
the indemnified party to the indemnifying party or will serve as an offset of
other amounts owed by the indemnifying party to the indemnified party.

 

7.08. _Waiver_. The Shareholders agree that any information supplied by the
Company or by or on behalf of any of the employees, directors, agents or
officers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the Shareholders or their
advisers in connection with this Agreement, the information in the Sellers
Disclosure Letter or otherwise shall not constitute a warranty, representation
or guarantee as to the accuracy of such information in favor of the
Shareholders, and the Shareholders hereby undertake to Purchaser and to the
Company that they waive any and all claims which they might otherwise have
against any of them in respect of such claims.

ARTICLE IX

 

TERMINATION

 

9.01. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the Merger and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned, at any time before the
Closing Date, by the Sellers Representative or Purchaser:

(a) _Mutual Agreement_. With the mutual agreement of the other parties.

(b) _Breach_. Upon thirty (30) days prior written notice of termination, if
there has occurred and is continuing: (i) in the case of Purchaser, a breach
by any Seller, and in the case of the Sellers, a breach by Purchaser or Merger
Sub, of any representation or warranty contained herein or (ii) in the case
of Purchaser, a breach by any Seller, and in the case of the Sellers, a
breach by Purchaser, of any covenant or agreement contained herein; _provided_
_that_ , in the case of each of clauses (i) and (ii), such breach has not been
cured within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice and such breach
(under either clause (i) or (ii)) would entitle Purchaser, in the case of a
breach by a Seller, or the Sellers, in the case of a breach by Purchaser, not
to consummate the Merger under ARTICLE VIII.

(c) _Denial of Regulatory Approval_. If the approval of any Governmental
Entity required for consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby is denied by final, non-appealable action of such
Governmental Entity; _provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this Section 9.01(c) shall not be available to any party whose failure
to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or
materially contributed to, the foregoing.

 

(d) _Delay_. If the Effective Time has not occurred by the close of business
on the twelve (12)-month anniversary of the date hereof (the " _Outside Date_
"); _provided_ that if the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(b) shall not
have been satisfied or duly waived by Purchaser and the Sellers Representative
by the fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Outside Date, Purchaser may, by
written notice delivered to the Sellers Representative, extend the Outside
Date from time to time to a date not later than the six (6)-month anniversary
of the Outside Date; _provided_ _further_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 9.01(d) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to comply with any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of,
or materially contributed to, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before such date.

 



78 (e) _Possible Adjustment_. The Sellers Representative will have the right
to terminate this Agreement at any time during the five (5)-day period
commencing on the Determination Date, if either:

(1) both of the following conditions are satisfied:

(a) the Average Purchaser Stock Price shall be less than $46.60; and

 

(b) (i) the number obtained by dividing the Average Purchaser Stock Price by
$58.25 (such quotient being referred to herein as the " _Purchaser Ratio_ ")
shall be less than (ii) the number obtained by dividing the Index Price on the
Determination Date by the Index Price on October 30, 2014 and subtracting 0.20
from the quotient in this clause (b)(ii) (such number being referred to
herein as the " _Index Ratio_ ");

or

 

(2) the Average Purchaser Stock Price shall be less than $37.86;

 

 _subject_ , _however_ , to the following five sentences. If the Sellers
Representative elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence, it shall give prompt written notice to
Purchaser, which notice shall specify which of clauses (1) or (2) is
applicable; _provided_ that if both clauses (1) and (2) would be applicable,
the Sellers Representative shall specify clause (2) in such notice; _provided_
_further_ that such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any
time within the aforementioned five (5)-day period. During the seven (7)-day
period commencing with its receipt of such notice, Purchaser shall have the
option, in the case of a failure to satisfy the condition in clause (1), of
adjusting the Exchange Ratio to equal the lesser of (x) a number equal to
a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the numerator of which is
the product of $46.60 _MULTIPLIED_ _BY_ the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect)
and the denominator of which is the Average Purchaser Stock Price, and (y)
a number equal to a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth), the
numerator of which is the Index Ratio _MULTIPLIED_ _BY_ the Exchange Ratio (as
then in effect) and the denominator of which is the Purchaser Ratio. During
such seven (7)-day period, Purchaser shall have the option, in the case of a
failure to satisfy the condition in clause (2), to elect to increase the
Exchange Ratio to a number equal to a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-
thousandth), the numerator of which is the product of $37.86 _MULTIPLIED_
_BY_ the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) and the denominator of which is
the Average Purchaser Stock Price (an Exchange Ratio calculated pursuant to
this sentence or the preceding sentence being referred to herein as the "
_Adjusted Exchange Ratio_ "). In lieu of adjusting the Exchange Ratio as
described in either of the two preceding sentences, Purchaser shall have the
option, in its sole discretion, of paying to the Shareholders an amount per
share of

 



79  Company Common Stock, in cash at the Closing, equal to the product of (x)
(a) the applicable Adjusted Exchange Ratio _MINUS_ (b) the Exchange Ratio as
then in effect,  _MULTIPLIED_ _BY_ (y) the Average Purchaser Stock Price. If
Purchaser makes an election contemplated by any one of the three preceding
sentences, within such ten (10)-day period, it shall give prompt written
notice to the Sellers Representative of such election and, if applicable, the
revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant
to this Section 9.01(e) and this Agreement shall remain in effect in
accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so
modified), and, if applicable, any references in this Agreement to "Exchange
Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio as adjusted
pursuant to this Section 9.01(e).

 

(f) _Applicable Law; Governmental Restriction; Material Adverse Effect_.

 

(1) Each of the Sellers Representative and Purchaser will have the right to
terminate this Agreement if: (i) any Applicable Law is enacted, entered,
promulgated, enforced or issued by any Governmental Entity or other restraint
or prohibition is in effect which prevents the consummation of the Merger or
(ii) there is a final and non-appealable denial by any Governmental Entity of
a consent necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated
hereby or Purchaser receives notification that a Governmental Entity will, as
a condition to its consent to the Merger, impose a Burdensome Condition.

(2) Purchaser will have the right to terminate this Agreement if any event,
change, circumstance or occurrence that, individually or together with any
other event, change, circumstance or occurrence, has occurred which has, or
would be reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse Effect with respect to
any Seller.

 

9.02. _Effect of Termination and Abandonment_. If this Agreement is terminated
and the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned, no
party will have any Liability or further obligation under this Agreement,
except that Section 5.02(j), Section 5.03(g), Sections 6.08(c)6.08(f), this
Section 9.02 and ARTICLE X, as well as any relevant definitions, will survive
termination of this Agreement and remain in full force and effect and except
that termination will not relieve a party from Liability for any willful
breach by it of this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE X

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

10.01. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, all fees

incurring such expense.

appropriately amended in order to reflect any such revised structure or
method.

 

10.05. _Governing Law_. The execution, interpretation, and performance of this
Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to any conflict-of-laws provision or rule (whether of the State
of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the

82 10.06. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT COULD
INVOLVE COMPLICATED OR DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A

OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY

PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (ii) THE PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) THE PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) THE PARTY HAS
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL
WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.06.

 

10.07. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the Schedules hereto
and the Disclosure Letters, contains the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof (and
supersedes any prior agreements, arrangements or understandings among any of
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof), and
there are no agreements, arrangements, understandings, representations or
warranties which are not set forth herein or therein.

10.08.  _Binding Effect; Assignment; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, this Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, this Agreement and all rights and Liabilities hereunder may
not be assigned by any party hereto except by the prior written consent of (i)
the Sellers Representative, in the case of Purchaser, or (ii) Purchaser, in
the case of any Seller; _provided_ that Purchaser may assign its right to
acquire any asset, its obligation to pay all or part of the consideration or
any of its other Liabilities to any wholly-owned Subsidiary without the prior
written consent of the other parties hereto if Purchaser agrees to guarantee
the performance of any such wholly-owned Subsidiary. The parties intend that
this Agreement shall not benefit or create any right or cause of action in or
on behalf of any person other than the parties hereto; _provided_ that the
provisions of ARTICLE VII will inure to the benefit of the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties and Seller Indemnified Parties and the provisions
of Section 6.13 will inure to the benefit of the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties. Any assignment in contravention of this Section 10.08 is null and
void.

 

10.09. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, and may be delivered by means of facsimile or email (or any
other electronic means, such as ".pdf" or ".tiff" files), each of which shall
be deemed to constitute an original, but all of which together shall be deemed
to constitute one and the same instrument.

 

10.10. _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
(i) monetary damages could not adequately compensate any party hereto in the
event of a breach of this Agreement by any other party which results in the
failure of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
consummated by the Outside Date (including, if

 



83  applicable, as extended in accordance with Section 9.01(d)); (ii) the non-
breaching party/parties would suffer irreparable harm in the event of such a
breach with such an effect; and (iii) the applicable non-breaching party
shall have, in addition to any other rights or remedies it may have at law or
in equity, specific performance and injunctive relief as a remedy for the
enforcement hereof. The parties agree to not seek, and agree to waive, any
requirement for the securing or posting of a bond or other security in
connection with a party seeking or obtaining any relief pursuant to this
Section 10.10.

 

10.11. _Severability_. Each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted
in such manner as to be effective and valid under Applicable Law, but in case
any one or more provisions contained in this Agreement shall, for any reason,
be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, (i) all other
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect for so long as the economic or legal substance of the transaction
contemplated hereby is not affected in a manner materially adverse to any
party and (ii) the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible, in a mutually acceptable manner, in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby can be consummated as originally contemplated to the
greatest extent possible.

 

10.12. _Subsidiary and Affiliate Action_. Wherever a party has an obligation
under this Agreement to "cause" a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of such party
or any such Subsidiarys or other Affiliates Representatives to take, or
refrain from taking, any action, or such action that may be necessary, to
accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, such obligation of such party
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of such party to cause
such Subsidiary or other Affiliate to take such action. Wherever this
Agreement provides that a Subsidiary or other Affiliate of a party has an
obligation to act or refrain from taking any action, such party shall be
deemed to have an obligation under this Agreement to cause such Subsidiary or
other Affiliate, or any such Subsidiarys or other Affiliates Representatives
to take, or refrain from taking, the action, or such action as may be
necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement. To the extent
necessary or appropriate to give meaning or effect to the provisions of this
Agreement or to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, Purchaser and the
Company, as the case may be, shall be deemed to have an obligation under this
Agreement to cause any Subsidiary thereof to take, or refrain from taking, any
action, and to cause such Subsidiarys Representatives to take, or refrain
from taking, any action, otherwise contemplated herein. Any failure by an
Affiliate of Purchaser or any Seller to act or refrain from taking any action
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Agreement by Purchaser or such Seller, respectively.

10.13. _Deadlines_. If the last day of the time period for the giving of any
notice or the taking of any action required under this Agreement falls on a
day other than a Business Day, the time period for giving such notice or
taking such action shall be extended through the next Business Day following
that day.

 

10.14. _Scope of Agreements_. This Agreement shall not create any partnership,
joint venture or other similar arrangement between any of the Sellers or any
of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Purchaser or any of its Affiliates,
on the other hand.

 



84 10.15. _Waivers and Consents_. Any waiver, permission, consent or approval of
any kind relating to any breach or default under this Agreement, or any
waiver of any provision or condition of this Agreement, shall be effective
only to the extent specifically set forth in writing. Notwithstanding any
provision set forth herein, no party hereto shall be required to take any
action or refrain from taking any action that would cause it to violate any
Applicable Law.

10.16.  _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no failure
to exercise or delay in exercising any right or remedy in connection with this
Agreement will effect a waiver of that right or remedy. No single or partial
exercise of any right or remedy in connection with this Agreement will
preclude any other or further exercise of that right or remedy or any other
right or remedy. Except as otherwise expressly provided, the rights and
remedies in connection with this Agreement are cumulative and not exhaustive.
