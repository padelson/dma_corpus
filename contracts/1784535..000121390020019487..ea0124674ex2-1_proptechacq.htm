with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party
of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The failure on the part of any Party to exercise, and no
delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise of such right, power, or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power, or remedy. The Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not perform their respective obligations under the provisions
of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in each case without posting a bond or

relief when expressly available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy
at Law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.</P>

Holder, the Holder Representative, the Company or any of his, her or its respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any
