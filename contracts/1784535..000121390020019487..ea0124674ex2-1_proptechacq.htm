Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

Section 2.2 _Effect of the Merger; Allocation of Total Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of any Party or any other Person, (i) each share of (x) Company
Common Stock (a " _Company Common Share_ ") that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares,
Company Restricted Shares (which shall be treated in accordance with _Section
2.2(b)(iv)_), and shares of Company Stock, if any, held in the treasury of
the Company, which treasury shares shall be canceled for no consideration as
part of the Merger and shall not constitute "Company Common Shares" hereunder)
shall be canceled and converted into and become the right to receive the
applicable portion of the Total Merger Consideration, as determined pursuant
to _Section 2.3_; and (ii) each Company Warrant (other than any Underwater
Warrant) that is unexercised and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall thereupon be canceled and converted into and become
the right to receive the applicable portion of the Total Merger
Consideration, as determined pursuant to _Section 2.3_ (all such Company
Warrants, the " _Canceled Warrants_ "). All Company Warrants that are
Underwater Warrants shall be canceled for no consideration and the holder
thereof shall have no further rights to such canceled Underwater Warrant, nor
will the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any of its and their respective Affiliates have any liability with respect
thereto.

(b) _Treatment of Outstanding Equity Awards_.

  



  

(i) _Company Options Held by Current Service Providers_. As of the Effective
Time, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a Pre-Closing Holder who
is providing services to the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any
action on the part of the Company, PTAC or the Pre-Closing Holder thereof, be
assumed and converted into an option (a " _PTAC Option_ ") with respect to a
number of PTAC Common Shares equal to the number of Company Common Shares
subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest whole
share set forth on the Allocation Schedule and at an exercise price per PTAC
Common Share equal to the exercise price per Company Common Share subject to
such Company Option divided by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounded up to
the nearest whole cent set forth on the Allocation Schedule; _provided_ that
the exercise price and the number of PTAC Common Shares subject to the PTAC
Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of
Section 409A of the Code, and, in the case of each Company Option that is
intended to qualify as an "incentive stock option" within the meaning of
Section 422 of the Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of
the Code. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 2.2(b)(i)_, each PTAC
Option shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Company Equity Plan and the applicable Company Option award agreement, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, immediately
prior to the Effective Time each active employee of the Company who is a Pre-
Closing Holder (an " _Employee Earn Out Recipient_ ") who holds a Company
Option shall receive such Pre-Closing Holder's allocation of the Earn Out
Shares, _provided_ that the vesting conditions for any such Employee Earn Out
Recipient shall also require that such Employee Earn Out Recipient remains in
continuous employment through the applicable vesting date.

  



  

(ii) _Company Options Held by Former Service Providers_. Immediately prior
to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is outstanding at such time
and held by a Pre-Closing Holder who is not then providing services to the
Company shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without
any action on the part of the Company, PTAC or the Pre-Closing Holder thereof,
be converted into a number of Company Common Shares equal to the number of
Company Common Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time, to the extent vested and exercisable, minus the number of
Company Common Shares that, when multiplied by the Per Common Share Value,
have a value equal to the aggregate exercise price and applicable withholding
taxes payable upon the exercise of such Company Option, and rounded down to
the nearest whole share, as set forth on the Allocation Schedule.

  



  

   

26

 



    



  

(iii) _Company RSUs_. As of the Effective Time, each award of Company RSUs
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue
of the occurrence of the Effective Time and without any action on the part of
the Company, PTAC or the Pre-Closing Holder thereof, be assumed and converted
into the right to receive an award of restricted stock units denominated in a
number of PTAC Common Shares (" _PTAC RSUs_ ") equal to the number of Company
Common Shares subject to such Company RSU award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to
the nearest whole share set forth on the Allocation Schedule. Except as
otherwise provided in this _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_ , each award of PTAC RSUs
shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the Company Equity
Plan and the applicable Company RSU award agreement, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time. In addition, immediately prior to the
Effective Time each Employee Earn Out Recipient who holds a Company RSU shall
receive such Pre-Closing Holder's allocation of the Earn Out Shares,
_provided_ that the vesting conditions for any Employee Earn Out Recipient
shall also require that such Employee Earn Out Recipient remains in
continuous employment through the applicable vesting date.

  



  

(iv) _Company Restricted Shares_. As of the Effective Time, each award of
Company Restricted Shares that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the occurrence of the Effective Time and
without any action on the part of the Company, PTAC or the Pre-Closing Holder
thereof, be assumed and converted into the right to receive an award of
restricted shares denominated in a number of PTAC Common Shares (" _PTAC
Restricted Shares_ ") equal to the number of Company Common Shares subject to
such Company Restricted Shares award immediately prior to the Effective
Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, and rounded down to the nearest
whole share set forth on the Allocation Schedule. Except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 2.2(b)(iv)_ , each award of PTAC Restricted Shares
shall continue to be subject to the terms and conditions of the Company
Equity Plan and the applicable Company Restricted Shares award agreement, as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition, immediately
prior to the Effective Time each Employee Earn Out Recipient who holds
Company Restricted Shares shall receive such Pre-Closing Holder's allocation
of the Earn Out Shares, _provided_ that the vesting conditions for any
Employee Earn Out Recipient shall also require that such Employee Earn Out
Recipient remains in continuous employment through the applicable vesting
date.

  



  

(v) Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors of the Company (or
appropriate committee thereof) shall pass resolutions and take such other
actions as are necessary to provide for the treatment of the Company Options,
Company RSUs and Company Restricted Shares as contemplated by this _Section
2.2(b)_.

    



  

   

27

 



    



  

(c) _Total Merger Consideration_. The aggregate consideration to be paid to
the Pre-Closing Holders in the Merger (the " _Total Merger Consideration_ ")
shall consist of: (i) the Closing Merger Consideration apportioned between
cash and PTAC Common Shares in the following manner: (x) cash in an amount as
determined pursuant to _Exhibit K_ (the " _Aggregate Cash Consideration_
") and (y) a number of PTAC Common Shares equal to the quotient obtained by
dividing (A) the Closing Merger Consideration _minus _ the Aggregate Cash
Consideration _by_ (B) the Redemption Value Price (the " _Aggregate Stock
Consideration_ "), and (ii) 5,000,000 Earn Out Shares (divided into
allotments of 1,666,667 $18 Earn Out Shares, 1,666,667 $20 Earn Out Shares
and 1,666,666 $22 Earn Out Shares as further described in _Section 2.6_).
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (1) for purposes
of calculating the Closing Merger Consideration, neither Closing Date
Indebtedness nor Unpaid Alternative Transaction Expenses shall be reduced by
any payments made in respect thereof after the Measurement Time and prior to
the Effective Time that has the effect of reducing Cash, and (2) PTAC shall
be entitled to rely on the Allocation Schedule and shall not be liable to any
Pre-Closing Holder for the amount of any payment to such Pre-Closing Holder
made in accordance with the Allocation Schedule or the calculation of any
such amount.

  



  

(d) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no certificate or scrip representing fractional PTAC Common Shares
shall be issued pursuant to this _Section 2.2_, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a stockholder of PTAC. In lieu of any fractional shares, PTAC shall pay
each Pre-Closing Holder entitled to any portion of PTAC Common Shares, and
such holder shall be entitled to receive, an amount in cash, rounded up to
the nearest cent, equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the
fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking into account all
Equity Securities held at the Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise
be entitled by (ii) the Redemption Value Price.

  



  

(e) _Adjustment to Aggregate Stock Consideration_. The Aggregate Stock
Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
other distribution of securities convertible into PTAC Common Shares),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the number of PTAC Common Shares
outstanding after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time so as to
provide the Pre-Closing Holders with the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event and as so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Aggregate Stock Consideration.

  



  

   

28

 



    



  

(f) _Allocation Schedule_. The Company acknowledges and agrees that (i) the
Total Merger Consideration is being allocated among the Pre-Closing Holders
pursuant to the schedule to be delivered to PTAC in connection with the
Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.3(e)_ (the " _Allocation Schedule_
") and such allocation (i) is and will be in accordance with the Governing
Documents of the Company, the Company Shareholder Agreements and applicable
Law, (ii) does and will set forth (A) the mailing addresses, telephone
numbers and email addresses, for each Pre-Closing Holder, (B) the number and
class of Equity Securities owned by each Pre-Closing Holder, (C) with respect
to any Pre-Closing Holder that is a holder of Canceled Warrants, the
aggregate exercise price payable for such Pre-Closing Holder with respect to
such Canceled Warrants, (D) the portion of the Total Merger Consideration
allocated to each Pre-Closing Holder (divided into the portion of the
Aggregate Stock Consideration, and the Earn Out Shares and the Cash Funding
Amount payable to such Pre-Closing Holder), (E) with respect to each Pre-
Closing Holder of Company Options, the number of PTAC Common Shares subject
to, and the exercise price per PTAC Common Share of, each PTAC Option, (F)
with respect to each Pre-Closing Holder of a Company RSU award, the number of
PTAC Common Shares subject to the PTAC RSU award (G) with respect to each
Pre-Closing Holder of Company Restricted Shares, the number of PTAC
Common Shares subject to such Company Restricted Shares and (H) the number of
Earn Out Shares to be issued to each Pre-Closing Holder upon the occurrence
of each Triggering Event set forth in _Section 2.6_, and (iii) is and will
otherwise be accurate. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, upon delivery, payment and issuance of the Total Merger
Consideration on the Closing Date in accordance with the Allocation Schedule,
PTAC and its respective Affiliates shall be deemed to have satisfied all
obligations with respect to the payment of consideration under this Agreement
(including with respect to the Total Merger Consideration), and none of them
shall have (i) any further obligations to the Company, any Pre-Closing Holder
or any other Person with respect to the payment of any consideration under
this Agreement (including with respect to the Total Merger Consideration), or
(ii) any Liability with respect to the allocation of the consideration under
this Agreement, and the Company hereby irrevocably waives and releases PTAC
and its Affiliates (and, on and after the Closing, the Company and its
Affiliates) from all claims arising from or related to such Allocation
Schedule and the allocation of the Total Merger Consideration, as the case may
be, among each Pre-Closing Holder as set forth in such Allocation Schedule.
The Company acknowledges and agrees that as of the date hereof certain Pre-
Closing Holders have entered into Support Agreements, and following the date
hereof, other Pre-Closing Holders may enter into additional Support
Agreements (each, a " _Supporting Pre-Closing Holder_ "), and the Company
covenants and agrees that the Allocation Schedule shall not contain any
reductions to the Applicable Company Stock Percentage of any Supporting Pre-
Closing Holder, or all Supporting Pre-Closing Holders taken as a whole.

    



  

(g) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
Company Stock for which the holder (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") thereof
(i) has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented to it in writing and
(ii) has demanded the appraisal of such shares in accordance with, and has
complied in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (collectively, the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive (A)
the portion of Total Merger Consideration applicable to such Dissenting
Shares and (B) the applicable Earn Out Shares to the extent payable as
provided herein, in each case, in accordance with the Allocation Schedule and
the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ that any such amounts that would
otherwise be payable in respect of such Dissenting Shares shall remain the
property of PTAC. From and after the Effective Time, (x) all Dissenting
Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist and (y) Dissenting Stockholders
shall be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to them under Section
262 of the DGCL and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the voting rights
or other rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Dissenting Stockholder effectively
withdraws or loses such appraisal rights (through failure to perfect such
appraisal rights or otherwise), then that Dissenting Stockholder's shares (i)
shall no longer be deemed to be Dissenting Shares and (ii) shall be treated as
if they had been converted automatically at the Effective Time into the right
to receive (x) the portion of Total Merger Consideration applicable to such
Dissenting Shares and (y) the applicable number of Earn Out Shares to the
extent payable as provided herein, in each case, in accordance with
the Allocation Schedule upon delivery of a duly completed and validly
executed Letter of Transmittal and the surrender of any Certificates in
accordance with _Section 2.3(c)_. Each Dissenting Stockholder who becomes
entitled to payment for his, her or its Dissenting Shares pursuant to the
DGCL shall receive payment thereof from the Exchange Agent in accordance with
the DGCL. For the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of determining the
Allocation Schedule and the other related definitions and terms that are
affected by the total number of Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, any and all Dissenting Shares shall be included in all
such determinations as if such Dissenting Shares were participating in the
Merger and were entitled to receive the applicable payments under this
Agreement. The Company shall give PTAC prompt notice of any written demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Stock, attempted withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by
the Company relating to stockholders' rights of appraisal in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and PTAC shall have the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
all such demands. The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of PTAC (prior to the Closing) or the Sponsor (after the
Closing), make any payment with respect to, settle or offer or agree to
settle any such demands. Any portion of the Total Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ to pay for
Dissenting Shares shall be returned to PTAC upon demand.

Section 2.3 _Payment of Total Merger Consideration; Other Closing Date
Payments_.

  



  

(a) _Deposit with Exchange Agent_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
PTAC shall deposit with an exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") mutually

Aggregate Cash Consideration (the cash so deposited with the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this _clause (iii)_ , the " _Cash Funding Amount_ ").

  



  

(b) _Payment of Certain Indebtedness_. At the Closing, PTAC shall pay, or
cause to be paid, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the
Indebtedness in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_ of the Company Schedules
pursuant to the payment instruments set forth in such Pay-Off Letters.

  



  

(c) _Letter of Transmittal_. Prior to the Closing Date and in accordance
with _Section 5.16_ of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to each
Pre-Closing Holder of Company Stock and Company Warrants a Letter Of

form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ (or as may otherwise be reasonably agreed
between PTAC and the Company) (the " _Warrant Cancelation Agreement_ "),
together with a request to have such Pre-Closing Holder deliver an executed
Letter of Transmittal and/or a Warrant Cancelation Agreement to the Company
and the Exchange Agent no less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing. At the Effective Time, (i) each Pre-Closing Holder of an outstanding
certificate or certificates for Company Stock (collectively, the "
_Certificates_ ") who has surrendered such Certificates to the Company
and the Exchange Agent (together with a properly completed Letter of
Transmittal), and (ii) each Pre-Closing Holder of Company Warrants, who has
delivered a Warrant Cancelation Agreement to the Company and the Exchange
Agent in accordance with the above timelines prior to the Closing shall be
entitled to receive the Total Merger Consideration in accordance with the
Allocation Schedule on the Closing Date following the Effective Time.
Promptly after the Effective Time, PTAC shall send, or shall cause the
Exchange Agent to send, to each Pre-Closing Holder of Company Stock that did
not receive a Company Stockholder Package pursuant to _Section 5.16_, a
Letter of Transmittal and/or a Warrant Cancelation Agreement for use in such
exchange. Following surrender of Certificates to the Company and the Exchange
Agent (together with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal) in the case
of Pre-Closing Holders of Company Stock, and/or delivery of a Warrant
Cancelation Agreement to the Company and the Exchange Agent in the case of
Pre-Closing Holders of Company Warrants, in each case following the Closing,
such Pre-Closing Holders shall be entitled to receive the Total Merger
Consideration in accordance with the Allocation Schedule within ten (10)
Business Days following such surrender and/or delivery of the applicable
documents. No interest or dividends will be paid or accrued on the
consideration payable upon delivery of a Letter of Transmittal or Warrant
Cancelation Agreement.

  



  

   

30

 



    



  

(d) _No Further Transfers_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of
transfers of any Company Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Company Stock is presented
to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Section 2.3_.

  



  

(e) _Closing Amounts_. On the date that is twelve (12) Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, PTAC shall deliver to the Company a written statement
setting forth its good faith estimate and calculation of any Excess PTAC
Transaction Expenses. On the date that is ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to PTAC a written statement ("
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth (i) its good faith calculation of (A)
Net Working Capital, (B) Closing Date Indebtedness, (C) Cash, and (D)
Unpaid Alternative Transaction Expenses, (ii) the Company's calculation of
the Closing Merger Consideration and (iii) the Allocation Schedule, in each
case, including a detailed itemization of the components thereof, and
determined in a manner consistent with the definitions thereof and the
Accounting Principles, to the extent included in the applicable definition.
Following PTAC's receipt of the Closing Statement and through the Closing
Date, PTAC shall have the right to review and comment on such
calculations and estimates, the Company shall consider in good faith any such
comments made by PTAC, and the Company and PTAC shall cooperate with each
other through the Closing Date and use good faith efforts to resolve any
differences regarding the calculation of the Closing Merger Consideration and
each of the components of the Closing Merger Consideration (and any updates or
revisions as may be agreed to by the Company and PTAC shall be included in
the Closing Statement). The Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, (i) reasonably cooperate with PTAC and its
Representatives to the extent related to its review of the Closing Statement
and the calculations and estimates contained therein (including engaging in
good faith discussions related thereto) and (ii) provide access to personnel,
books, records and other information during normal business hours to the
extent related to the preparation of the Closing Statement and reasonably
requested by PTAC or its Representatives in connection with such review;
_provided_  that PTAC shall not, and shall cause its Representatives to not,
unreasonably interfere with the business of the Company in connection with
any such access.

  



  

   

31

 



    



  

Section 2.4 _Exchange Agent_. Promptly following the date that is one year
after the Effective Time, PTAC shall instruct the Exchange Agent to deliver
to PTAC all cash, certificates and other documents in its possession relating
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and the Exchange Agent's duties
shall terminate. Thereafter, each Pre-Closing Holder who has not delivered a
Letter of Transmittal or Warrant Cancelation Agreement may surrender such
Certificate or deliver such Letter of Transmittal or Warrant Cancelation
Agreement to PTAC and (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and
similar Laws) receive in consideration therefor, and PTAC shall promptly pay,
the portion of the Total Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
as determined in accordance with this  _Article 2_ without any interest
thereon. None of PTAC, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Total
Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to and in
accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. If
any Certificate shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such
date on which any amounts payable pursuant to this _Article 2_ would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any
such amounts shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement to the contrary, PTAC, the Company, and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any cash, stock consideration or other
amounts otherwise paid or payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement to any Person such amounts that
PTAC, the Company or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold
with respect thereto under the Code or any provision of applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that PTAC will use reasonable efforts to provide the
Company with written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to any such
deduction or withholding (other than deductions or withholdings (x) with
respect to amounts treated as compensation for applicable Tax purposes or (y)
a failure to deliver the certificate referenced in _Section 5.6(b))_ , such
notice to include reasonable detail and the authority and method of
calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding, and (a) PTAC and/or the
applicable withholding agent shall consider in good faith any claim by the
Company or the applicable Pre-Closing Holder that such deduction or
withholding is not required or should be imposed at a reduced rate and (b)
PTAC and/or the applicable withholding agent shall cooperate with the Company
or the applicable Pre-Closing Holder in good faith to minimize, to the extent
permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any such deduction or
withholding, including by cooperating with the submission of any certificates
or forms to establish an exemption from, reduction in, or refund of any such
deduction or withholding. To the extent that amounts so deducted and
withheld are duly deposited with the appropriate Governmental Authority, such
deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

Section 2.6 _Earn-Out_.

  



  

(a) At the Effective Time, in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 2.2(a)_ , _Section 2.2(b)_ and the Allocation Schedule, PTAC shall
issue or cause to be issued to each Pre-Closing Holder, such Pre-Closing
Holder's proportionate allocation of 5,000,000 restricted PTAC Common Shares
which shall be subject to the vesting and forfeiture provisions provided for
in this _Section 2.6_ and, in the case of such restricted PTAC Common Shares
issued with respect to Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Restricted
Shares, the vesting and forfeiture conditions provided for in _Section
2.2(b)_ (collectively, the " _Earn Out Shares_ "):

  



  

(i) 1,666,667 of the Earn Out Shares will vest upon the occurrence of
Triggering Event I (the " _$18 Earn Out Shares_ ");

  



  

(ii) 1,666,667 of the Earn Out Shares will vest upon the occurrence of
Triggering Event II (the " _$20 Earn Out Shares_ "); and

  



  

(iii) 1,666,666 Earn Out Shares will vest upon the occurrence of Triggering
Event III (the " _$22 Earn Out Shares_ ").

  



  

For illustrative purposes, if, prior to the expiration of the Earn Out
Period:

  



  

(i) the Closing Price of the PTAC Common Shares is greater than or equal to
$18.00 over any twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty- (30-) consecutive
Trading Day period, all of the $18 Earn Out Shares shall vest;

  



  

(ii) the Closing Price of the PTAC Common Shares is greater than or equal to
$20.00 over any twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty- (30-) consecutive
Trading Day period, all of the $20 Earn Out Shares shall vest and, if not
already vested, all of the $18 Earn Out Shares shall vest; and

  



  

(iii) the Closing Price of the PTAC Common Shares is greater than or equal to
$22.00 over any twenty (20) Trading Days within any thirty- (30-) consecutive
Trading Day period, all of the $22 Earn Out Shares shall vest and, if not
already vested, all of the $18 Earn Out Shares and $20 Earn Out Shares shall
vest.

  



  

(b) Subject to the limitations contemplated herein, each Pre-Closing Holder
shall have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the Earn Out
Shares, including the right to receive dividends and to vote such shares;
_provided_ that the Earn Out Shares shall not entitle the holder thereof to
consideration in connection with any sale or other transaction and may not be
offered, sold, transferred, redeemed, assigned, pledged, hypothecated,
encumbered or otherwise disposed of (whether by operation of law or
otherwise) by the Pre-Closing Holder or be subject to execution, attachment
or similar process without the consent of PTAC, and shall bear a customary
legend with respect to such transfer restrictions. Any attempt to so sell,
transfer, assign, pledge, hypothecate, encumber or otherwise dispose of such
Earn Out Shares shall be null and void.

  



  

   

33

 



    



  

(c) If, at any time prior to the expiration of the Earn Out Period, any
Employee Earn Out Recipient ceases, for any reason or no reason, to remain in
continuous employment with a Group Company (a " _Former Employee Earn Out
Recipient_ "), all unvested Earn Out Shares issued with respect to any
Company Options, Company RSUs or Company Restricted Shares and held by such
Employee Earn Out Recipient shall be deemed to be automatically forfeited to
PTAC and PTAC shall then distribute such Earn Out Shares to the other Pre-
Closing Holders on a _pro rata_ basis based upon the allocation of Earn Out
Shares as of the Closing Date (but disregarding any Earn Out Shares issued to
a Former Employee Earn Out Recipient with respect to any Company Options,
Company RSUs or Company Restricted Shares held by such Former Employee Earn
Out Recipient). Any Earn Out Shares distributed to Employee Earn Out
Recipients in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall
be granted to such individuals pursuant to the New Incentive Plan.

  



  

(d) The Earn Out Shares shall also be subject to the forfeiture provisions
set forth on _Section 2.6(d)_ of the Company Schedules.

  



  

(e) If the applicable Triggering Event has not occurred prior to the
expiration of the Earn Out Period, then all Earn out Shares which would vest
in connection with such Triggering Event shall be automatically forfeited and
deemed transferred to PTAC and shall be cancelled by PTAC and cease to exist.
For the avoidance of doubt, prior to such forfeiture, all Earn Out Shares
shall be entitled to any dividends or distributions made to the holders of
PTAC Common Shares and shall be entitled to the voting rights
generally granted to holders of PTAC Common Shares.

  



  

(f) In the event of occurrence of any Triggering Event set forth in _Section
2.6(a)_, as soon as practicable (but in any event within five (5) Business
Days), the Sponsor (on behalf of PTAC) will deliver to the
Holder Representative a written statement (each, a " _Stock Price Earn Out
Statement_ ") that sets forth (i) the Closing Price over the applicable
20-Trading Day period and (ii) the calculation of the Earn Out Shares in
connection therewith and the Allocation Schedule. The Holder Representative
may deliver written notice to the Sponsor (on behalf of PTAC) on or prior to
the fifteenth (15th) day after receipt of a Stock Price Earn Out Statement
specifying in reasonable detail any items that they wish to dispute and the
basis therefor. If the Holder Representative fails to deliver such written
notice in such fifteen (15) day period, then the Pre-Closing Holders will be
deemed to have waived their right to contest such Stock Price Earn Out
Statement and the calculations set forth therein. If the Holder
Representative provides the Sponsor with written notice of any objections to
the Stock Price Earn Out Statement in such fifteen (15) day period, then the
Holder Representative and the Sponsor (on behalf of PTAC) will, for a
period of twenty (20) days following the date of delivery of such notice,
attempt to resolve their differences and any written resolution by them as to
any disputed amount will be final and binding for all purposes under this
Agreement. If at the conclusion of such twenty (20) day period the Holder
Representative and the Sponsor (on behalf of PTAC) have not reached an
agreement on any objections with respect to the Stock Price Earn Out
Statement, then upon the written request of either party the parties will
refer the dispute to an independent accountant of national standing as shall
be mutually agreed upon in good faith by the Holder Representative and the

exculpation during such six (6) year period. To the maximum extent permitted

advance expenses in connection with such indemnification as provided in such
Group Company's Governing Documents or other applicable agreements. The
indemnification and liability limitation or exculpation provisions of the
Group Companies' Governing Documents shall not, during such six (6) year
period, be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing in any
manner that would materially and adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, as of the Closing or at any time prior to the Closing, were
directors or officers of any Group Company (the " _D andO Persons_") to be so
indemnified, have their liability limited or be exculpated with respect to
any matters occurring prior to Closing and relating to the fact that such DandO

in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

insurance coverage for the benefit of the those Persons who are currently
covered by any comparable insurance policies of the Group Companies as of the
date hereof with respect to matters occurring on or prior to the Closing (the
" _Company D andO Tail Policy_"). Such "tail" policy shall provide coverage
on terms (with respect to coverage and amount) that are substantially the
same as (and no less favorable in the aggregate to the insured than) the
coverage provided under the Group Companies' directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ that the Group
Companies shall not pay a premium for such "tail" policy in excess of 300% of
the most recent annual premium paid by the Group Companies prior to the date
of this Agreement and, in such event, the Group Companies shall purchase the
maximum coverage available for 300% of the most recent annual premium paid by
the Group Companies prior to the date of this Agreement.

this _Section 5.5_.

  



  

(e) The DandO Persons entitled to the indemnification, liability limitation,
exculpation and insurance set forth in this _Section 5.5_ are intended to be

70

 



    



  

Section 5.6  _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Treatment_.

  



  

(i) Each of the Parties intend that the Merger shall constitute a transaction
that qualifies as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, and each Party shall, and shall cause its respective Affiliates to,
use reasonable best efforts to so qualify and shall file all Tax Returns
consistent with, and take no position inconsistent with (whether in Tax
Returns, Tax Proceedings, or otherwise) such treatment unless required to do
so pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

  



  

(ii) The PTAC Parties and the Company hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan
of reorganization" for the purposes of Section 368 of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a). The Parties shall not take any
action, or knowingly fail to take any action, which action or failure to act
prevents or impedes, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or
impede, the Intended Tax Treatment.

  



  

(iii) If, in connection with the preparation and filing of the Registration
Statement / Proxy Statement, the SEC requests or requires that tax opinions
be prepared and submitted in such connection, PTAC and the Company shall
deliver to Kirkland and Ellis LLP and Sidley Austin LLP, respectively,
customary Tax representation letters satisfactory to its counsel, dated and
executed as of the date the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement is
declared effective by the SEC and such other date(s) as determined reasonably
necessary by such counsel in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Registration Statement / Proxy Statement, and, if required, Sidley Austin
LLP shall furnish an opinion, subject to customary assumptions and
limitations, to the effect that the Merger will qualify as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

  



  

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, if, after the date
hereof but prior to the time at which Shareholder Approval has been obtained,
PTAC and the Company mutually determine in good faith that the Merger is not
reasonably expected to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to restructure the transactions contemplated hereby (such restructured
transactions, the " _Alternative Transaction Structure_ ") in a manner that
is reasonably expected to cause the Alternative Transaction Structure to so
qualify, including by adding a second merger to take place immediately after
the Merger whereby the surviving company in the Merger would merge with and
into a new limited liability company that is a wholly-owned Subsidiary of
PTAC (" _Newco_ "), with Newco being the surviving company in such merger.

  



  

(b) _FIRPTA Certificate_. PTAC hereby requests, and the Company shall deliver
to PTAC prior to the Closing, (i) a certificate pursuant to Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h), dated not more than thirty
(30) days prior to the Closing Date and signed by an executive officer of the
Company, certifying that the equity interests in the Company are not "United
States real property interests" (as defined in Section 897(c)(1) of the
Code), (ii) a copy of the notification provided to the Internal Revenue
Service regarding such certificate, in accordance with the provisions of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2), and (iii) a duly executed IRS
Form W-9 from the Company.

  



  

(c) _Tax Matters Cooperation_. Each of the Parties shall (and shall cause
their respective Affiliates to) cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by another Party, in connection with the filing of
relevant Tax Returns, and any Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision (with the
right to make copies) of records and information reasonably relevant to any
tax proceeding or audit, making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder.

Section 5.7  _Financing_.

  



  

(a) PTAC shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the PIPE Financing
(and the Company shall reasonably cooperate with PTAC in connection thereto)
on a timely basis on the terms and conditions described in the Subscription
Agreements, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) comply with
its respective obligations under the Subscription Agreements, (ii) maintain in
effect the Subscription Agreements in accordance with the terms and
conditions thereof, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions
and covenants applicable to PTAC set forth in the applicable Subscription
Agreements within its control, and (iv) consummate the PIPE Financing when
required pursuant to this Agreement. PTAC shall give the Company prompt
written notice upon having actual knowledge of any breach or default by any
party to any of the Subscription Agreements or any termination (or purported
termination) of any of the Subscription Agreements. Other than as set forth
in this _Section 5.7(a)_ or _Section 5.7(b)_, PTAC shall not, without the
prior written consent of the Company, amend, modify, supplement or waive any
of the conditions or contingencies to funding set forth in the Subscription
Agreements or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Subscription
Agreements (except as otherwise permitted hereunder), in each case to the
extent such amendment, modification, supplement or waiver would reasonably be
expected to have the effect of adversely affecting in any respect the ability
of PTAC to timely consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including by reducing the aggregate amount of the PIPE Financing contemplated
in the Subscription Agreements such that the _Aggregate PTAC Transaction
Proceeds_ would not be sufficient to satisfy the condition set forth in
_Section 6.3(d)_.

  



  

(b) If all or any portion of the PIPE Financing becomes unavailable, (i) PTAC
shall promptly use its reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain the PIPE
Financing or such portion of the PIPE Financing from alternative sources in an
amount, when added to any portion of the PIPE Financing that is available,
equal to the PIPE Financing Amount (any alternative source(s) of financing, "
_Alternative PIPE Financing_ ") and (ii) in the event that PTAC is able to
obtain any Alternative PIPE Financing, PTAC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to enter into a new subscription agreement (each, an " _Alternative
Subscription Agreement_ ") that provides for the subscription and purchase of
PTAC Class A Shares containing terms and conditions not materially less
favorable from the standpoint of PTAC and the Affiliates of PTAC party
thereto than those in the Subscription Agreements entered into as of the date
hereof (as determined in the reasonable good faith judgment of PTAC). In such
event, the term " _PIPE Financing_ " as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any Alternative PIPE Financing, the term " _Subscription

for PTAC Class A Shares under any Alternative Subscription Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, if all or any portion of the PIPE Financing or Alternative
PIPE Financing becomes unavailable, PTAC may utilize deposits, proceeds or
any other amounts from the Trust Account and, to the extent reasonably
acceptable to the Company, any additional third party financing to satisfy
its financing obligations hereunder (including to satisfy the Minimum Cash

result in the loss of the ability to successfully assert any attorney-client
or work product privilege ( _provided _ that, in each case, the Company
shall, and shall cause the other Group Companies to, use best efforts to
provide (1) such materials as can be provided (or otherwise convey such
information regarding the applicable matter as can be conveyed) and (2) such
other information, in a manner without violating such privilege or Law). No
such notice shall constitute an acknowledgement or admission by the Party
providing the notice regarding whether or not any of the conditions to the
Closing have been satisfied or in determining whether or not any of the
representations, warranties, or covenants contained in this Agreement have
been breached.

  



  

Section 5.20  _Section 280G_ _._ To the extent PTAC and the Company agree
in good faith that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement constitute
a "change in control event" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code,
the Company shall (a) prior to the Closing Date, solicit and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain from each "disqualified individual" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code) who could receive or retain any
payment or benefits that could constitute a "parachute payment" (within the
meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A) of the Code) a waiver of such disqualified
individual's rights to some or all of such payments or benefits (the "
_Waived 280G Benefits_ ") so that no payments and/or benefits shall be deemed
to be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code) and (b) prior to the Closing Date submit to a Company shareholder
vote (along with adequate disclosure satisfying the requirements of Section
280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and any regulations promulgated thereunder) the
right of any such "disqualified individual" to receive the Waived 280G
Benefits. Prior to soliciting such waivers and approval materials, the
Company shall provide drafts of the calculations, waivers and approval
materials to PTAC for its review and comment no later than five (5) Business
Days prior to soliciting such waivers and soliciting such approval, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any comments provided by PTAC. If any of
the Waived 280G Benefits fail to be approved in accordance with the
requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code as contemplated above, such
Waived 280G Benefits shall not be made or provided. Prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to PTAC evidence reasonably acceptable to PTAC that a
vote of the Company shareholders was solicited in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section and that either (i) the requisite number
of votes of the Company shareholders was obtained with respect to the Waived
280G Benefits (the " _280G Approval_ ") or (ii) the 280G Approval was not
obtained, and, as a consequence, the Waived 280G Benefits shall not be
retained or provided.

  



  

Section 5.21 _Pay-Off Letters_ _._ The Company shall deliver to PTAC at least
two (2) days prior to the Closing Date, customary pay-off letters (the "
_Pay-Off Letters_ ") in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to PTAC,
with respect to the pay-off amounts of the Indebtedness to be repaid at
Closing in accordance with _Section 2.3(b)_ of the Company Schedules as
indicated thereon, necessary to secure the automatic release of Liens and
guarantees, as applicable, provided in connection with such Indebtedness
upon the repayment of such Indebtedness, along with arrangements satisfactory
to PTAC to file and/or deliver evidence of termination and/or release, as
applicable, of such Liens and guarantees related to such Indebtedness,
including security interests related to Intellectual Property recorded in the
United States Patent and Trademark Office, United States Copyright Office, or
any other authorized United States Intellectual Property registrar.

  



  

Section 5.22 _Amendments to Agreements_. As promptly as practicable following
the date hereof, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
amend any agreement to which it is a party (including each of the agreements
set forth on _Section 5.22_ of the Company Schedules) that contains any
outstanding "earn-out", contingent purchase price, or other contingent or
deferred payment obligation in the form of Company Stock, options to purchase
Company Stock, or any similar right in respect of Company Stock, such that
such "earn-out", contingent purchase price, or other contingent or deferred
payment obligation, option to purchase, or any similar right is extinguished
effective as of the Effective Time, and replaced with a corresponding right to
acquire a corresponding number of PTAC Common Shares at a price no less than
the Redemption Value Price, in each case, in accordance with and subject to
the terms and conditions (including the achievement of the required
milestones) set forth in the applicable agreement.

binding obligations of the Parties and (b) the Confidentiality Agreement,
which shall survive such termination and remain a valid and binding
obligation of the Parties thereto in accordance with its terms.

with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior

any Party (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior
written consent of PTAC (prior to the Closing) or the Sponsor (after the
Closing), on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand. Any attempted
assignment of this Agreement not in accordance with the terms of this

amended except as provided in the immediately preceding sentence and any
purported amendment by any Party or Parties effected in a manner which does
not comply with this _Section 8.3_ shall be void, _ab
initio_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no
amendment or modification that is materially and disproportionately adverse
to a Pre-Closing Holder relative to other Pre-Closing Holders holding the same
class of Equity Securities in the Company (in each case, in their capacity as
Pre-Closing Holders) shall be binding upon such disproportionately affected
Pre-Closing Holders or any of the Parties unless the Pre-Closing Holders
holding a majority of the adversely affected Company Common Shares,
Company Preferred Shares, Company Options, Company RSUs, Company Warrants
and/or Company Restricted Shares (as applicable, and in each case voting

Section 8.10  _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, all other
provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is
not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

  



  

Section 8.11  _Counterparts; Electronic Signatures_. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an
original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement. The
words "execution," "signed," "signature," and words of like import in this
Agreement or in any other certificate, agreement or document related to this
Agreement or the other Ancillary Documents shall include images of manually
executed signatures transmitted by facsimile or other electronic format
(including, "pdf", "tif" or "jpg") and other electronic signatures
(including, DocuSign and AdobeSign). The use of electronic signatures and
electronic records (including, any contract or other record created,
generated, sent, communicated, received, or stored by electronic means) shall
be of the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a manually
executed signature or use of a paper-based record-keeping system to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, including the Federal Electronic
Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, the Delaware
Uniform Electronic Transactions Act and any other applicable law. Minor
variations in the form of the signature page, including footers from earlier

doubt, none of the individuals set forth on _Section 8.12(a) _of the Company

Section 8.13  _No Recourse_. All Proceedings, Liabilities and causes of
action (whether in contract or in tort, in Law or in equity or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, be in respect of, arise under, out or by
reason of, be connected with or relate in any manner to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in this Agreement), may be made against only
(and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the Persons
that are expressly identified herein as Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. No Person who is not a Party, including any

tort, in Law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any Proceedings,
Liabilities or causes of action arising under, out or by reason of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in

extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts
of any PTAC Party set forth herein, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of any PTAC Party set forth herein, or (c)
waive compliance by any PTAC Party with any of the agreements or conditions

(i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the Company set forth herein, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the Pre-Closing Holder or the Company set
forth herein, or (iii) waive compliance by the Company with any of the
agreements or conditions set forth herein. Any agreement on the part of any
Party or the Sponsor to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such Person. Any waiver
of any term or condition shall not be construed as a waiver of any
subsequent breach or a subsequent waiver of the same term or condition, or a
waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement. The failure of any
Party or the Sponsor to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

  



  

Section 8.15  _Waiver of Jury Trial_. THE PARTIES EACH HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM,
DEMAND, ACTION, OR CAUSE OF ACTION (I) ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR UNDER
ANY ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR (II) IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH OR RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THE DEALINGS OF THE PARTIES IN RESPECT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
ANCILLARY DOCUMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS RELATED HERETO OR THERETO OR
ANY FINANCING IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR ANY

HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE. THE
PARTIES EACH HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION,
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT
THE PARTIES MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT WITH
ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE PARTIES HERETO TO THE
WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

  



  

   

92

 



    



  

Section 8.16  _Jurisdiction_. Any Proceeding based upon, arising out of or
related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby must be
brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, to the extent
such Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the Superior Court of
the State of Delaware), or, if it has or can acquire jurisdiction, in the
United States District Court for the District of Delaware, and each of the
parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such
court in any such Proceeding, waives any objection it may now or hereafter
have to personal jurisdiction, venue or to convenience of forum, agrees that
all claims in respect of the Proceeding shall be heard and determined only in
any such court, and agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
other court. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to affect the right of
any party to serve process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence
legal Proceedings or otherwise proceed against any other party in any other
jurisdiction, in each case, to enforce judgments obtained in any Proceeding
brought pursuant to this _Section 8.16_.

  



  

Section 8.17  _Remedies_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any
and all remedies provided herein will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such
Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The failure on the part of any Party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power, or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise
of such right, power, or remedy by such Party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power, or remedy. The
Parties agree that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
Parties do not perform their respective obligations under the provisions of
this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in
accordance with their specific terms or otherwise breach such provisions. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in each case without posting a bond
or undertaking and without proof of damages and this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the
Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement on the basis that the other parties have an
adequate remedy at Law or an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

Section 8.18  _Holder Representative_.

  



  

(a) By consenting to this Agreement, executing a Letter of Transmittal or
Warrant Cancelation Agreement, or accepting any consideration as contemplated

Hanauer to act as a representative for the benefit of the Pre-Closing
Holders, as the sole and exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact to act

_Section 8.20_ under this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents following
the Closing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Holder Representative shall have the full power and authority to take any and
all actions on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders that is necessary,
appropriate or desirable to carry out all of the duties, responsibilities and
obligations of the Holder Representative under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents, including the power and authority to: (i) interpret
the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the documents to be executed
and delivered in connection therewith; (ii) execute and deliver, and receive
deliveries of, all agreements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals,
extension, waivers, undertakings, and other documents required or permitted
to be given in connection with _Section 2.6_ and _Section 8.20_ of this
Agreement, (iii) receive service of process in connection with any claims made
pursuant to and _Section 8.20_ of this Agreement; (iv) make any calculations
and determinations and settle any matters on behalf of all Pre-Closing
Holders in connection with _Section 2.6_ or _Section 8.20_ of this
Agreement, and in connection therewith issue notices and instructions to the
Exchange Agent in accordance with the terms of the applicable Ancillary
Documents; (v) assert or pursue on behalf of the Pre-Closing Holders any
Proceeding or investigation against any of the other Parties, consenting to,
compromising or settling any such Proceedings or investigations, conducting
negotiations with any of the other Parties and their respective
Representatives regarding such Proceeding or investigations pursuant to
_Section 2.6_ or _Section 8.20_ of this Agreement, and, in connection
therewith, to: (A) assert or institute any Proceeding or investigation; (B)
file any proofs of debt, claims and petitions as the Holder Representative
may deem advisable or necessary; and (C) file and prosecute appeals from any
decision, judgment or award rendered in any such Proceeding or investigation;
and (vi) to make, execute, acknowledge and deliver all such other statements,
agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts, endorsements, notices,
requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers, letters and other
writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to take any and all
action that the Holder Representative, in his sole and absolute discretion,
may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with or to carry
out the transactions contemplated by _Section 2.6_ or _Section 8.20_ of
this Agreement and all Ancillary Documents to which Holder Representative is
party (including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with _Article
2_). Joe Hanauer hereby (i) accepts his appointment as the
Holder Representative and authorization to act as attorney-in-fact and agent
on behalf of each Pre-Closing Holder in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 8.18_, and (ii) agrees to perform his obligations hereunder and
thereunder and otherwise comply with this _Section 8.18_.

  



  

   

94

 



    



  

(b) PTAC, Sponsor, and any other Person may conclusively and absolutely rely,
without inquiry, upon any action or decision of the Holder Representative in
all matters referred to herein. PTAC and Sponsor are entitled to deal
exclusively with the Holder Representative on all matters arising under or in
connection with _Section 2.6_, or _Section 8.20_ or this _Section
8.18_. Any action taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings
made, given or executed by the Holder Representative with respect to all such
matters, for or on behalf of any Pre-Closing Holder, shall be deemed an action
taken or not taken or decisions, communications or writings made, given or
executed by such Pre-Closing Holder. Any notice or communication delivered to
the Holder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.6_, _Section 8.20_ or this
_Section 8.18 _shall be deemed to have been delivered to all the Pre-Closing
Holder. PTAC and Sponsor shall be entitled to disregard any decisions,
communications or writings made, given or executed by any Pre-Closing Holder
in connection with any matter arising under or in connection with  _Section
2.6_, _Section 8.20_ or this _Section 8.18_, unless the same is made, given
or executed by the Holder Representative.

  



  

(c) The appointment of the Holder Representative as each Pre-Closing Holder's
attorney-in-fact revokes any power of attorney heretofore granted that
authorized any other Person or Persons to act as agent and to represent such
Pre-Closing Holder with regard to the matters contemplated by _Section 2.6_,
_Section 8.20_ or this _Section 8.18_. The grant of authority provided for
herein (A) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable and survive
the death, incompetency, bankruptcy, or liquidation of any Pre-Closing
Holder, and (B) shall survive the consummation of transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Holder Representative may
resign as the Holder Representative at any time by providing written notice to
PTAC (prior to the Closing) or the Sponsor (after the Closing), which
resignation shall become effective upon appointment of a successor Holder
Representative (who is reasonably acceptable to PTAC (prior to the Closing) or
the Sponsor (after the Closing)) by the Pre-Closing Holders constituting a
majority of the Company Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time. All
power, authority, rights, privileges, and obligations conferred in this
Agreement to the Holder Representative shall apply to any such successor
Holder Representative.

  



  

(d) The Holder Representative hereby represents and warrants on behalf of
itself to each PTAC Party as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date,
as follows:

  



  

(i) The Holder Representative has the requisite capacity, power and authority
to execute and deliver this Agreement and each of the Ancillary Documents to
which he is or will be a party, to perform his obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

  



  

   

95

 



    



  

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents to
which the Holder Representative is or will be a party and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been (or, in the case of
any Ancillary Document entered into after the date of this Agreement, will be
upon execution thereof) duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of
the Holder Representative. This Agreement and each Ancillary Document to
which the Holder Representative is or will be a party has been or will be
upon execution thereof, duly and validly executed and delivered by the Holder
Representative and constitutes or will constitute, upon execution and
delivery thereof, as applicable, a valid, legal and binding agreement of the
Holder Representative, enforceable against the Holder Representative in
accordance with their terms (subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other Laws affecting generally the enforcement
of creditors' rights and subject to general principles of equity).

  



  

(iii) The Holder Representative has the sole power, authority and control of
the Pre-Closing Holders with respect to the matters relating to this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including as contemplated in _Section
8.18(a)_, and in general to do all other things and to perform all other
acts, including executing and delivering all agreements, certificates,
receipts, instructions, and other instruments, contemplated by, or deemed
advisable in connection with, this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, in
each case on behalf of a Pre-Closing Holder.

  



  

(e) The Holder Representative shall be reimbursed for all such fees, costs,
and expenses by the Company as Company Expenses.

  



  

Section 8.19  _Trust Account Waiver_. Reference is made to the final
prospectus of PTAC, dated as of November 21, 2019, filed with the SEC (File
No. 333-234512) on November 22, 2019 (the " _Prospectus_ "). The Holder
Representative (on behalf of each Pre-Closing Holder) and the Company
acknowledge and agree and understand that PTAC has established a trust account
(the " _Trust Account_ ") containing the proceeds of its initial public
offering (the " _IPO_ ") and from certain private placements occurring
simultaneously with the IPO (including interest accrued from time to time
thereon) for the benefit of PTAC's public shareholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by PTAC's underwriters, the "
_Public Shareholders_ "), and PTAC may disburse monies from the Trust Account
only in the express circumstances described in the Prospectus. For and in
consideration of PTAC entering into this Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, each of the Holder Representative (on behalf of each Pre-Closing
Holder) and the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Representatives that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, none of the Company, the Holder Representative, any Pre-
Closing Holder, or any of their respective Representatives does now or shall
at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in
or to any monies in the Trust Account or distribution therefrom to Public
Stockholders or otherwise occurring prior to the Closing in accordance with
the terms of the Trust Agreement (" _Public Distributions_ "), or make any
claim against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom),
regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with or
relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business
relationship between PTAC or its Representatives, on the one hand, and any
Pre-Closing Holder, the Holder Representative, the Company or any of his, her
or its respective Representatives, on the other hand, or any other matter,
and regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or
any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively
referred to hereafter as the " _Trust Account Released Claims_ "). The Holder
Representative (on behalf of each Pre-Closing Holder) and the Company on his,
her or its own behalf and on behalf of his, her or its respective
Representatives hereby irrevocably waives any Trust Account Released Claims
that such Person and his, her or its respective Representatives may have
against the Trust Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in
the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, or Contracts
with PTAC or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of any agreement with PTAC or its
Affiliates).

on the date of this Agreement, any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Company Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be
retained and owned collectively by the Company Advised Parties, shall be
controlled by the Holder Representative on behalf of the Company and shall not
pass to or be claimed by PTAC or the Surviving Corporation. All Company Deal

whatsoever between or among any of Prior PTAC Counsel, PTAC, any of the PTAC
Advised Parties, or any of their respective Representatives that relate in any
way to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions

any dispute arising under this Agreement (collectively, the " _PTAC Deal
Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained and owned collectively by
the PTAC Advised Parties, shall be controlled by the Sponsor and shall not
pass to or be claimed by PTAC or the Surviving Corporation. All PTAC Deal
Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged PTAC

privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to the Sponsor, shall be controlled by the Sponsor and shall
not pass to or be claimed by PTAC or the Surviving Corporation;  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that nothing contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by
PTAC or any of its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and its Affiliates) of any applicable privileges or

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute arises between
PTAC or the Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and a third party other
than the Holder Representative or the Sponsor on the other hand, PTAC or the
Surviving Corporation may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent the
disclosure of the Privileged Company Deal Communications and Privileged PTAC

neither PTAC nor the Surviving Corporation may waive such privilege with
respect to (i) Privileged Company Deal Communications without the prior
written consent of the Holder Representative or (ii) Privileged PTAC Deal
Communications without the prior written consent of the Sponsor. In the event
that PTAC or the Surviving Corporation is legally required by governmental
order or otherwise to access or obtain a copy of all or a portion of (i) the
Privileged Company Deal Communications, PTAC shall immediately (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Holder Representative in
writing (including by making specific reference to this _Section 8.20_) so
that the Holder Representative can seek a protective order and (ii) the
Privileged PTAC Deal Communications, PTAC shall immediately (and, in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Sponsor in writing (including
by making specific reference to this _Section 8.20_) so that the Sponsor can
seek a protective order and, in either case, PTAC agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to assist therewith.

  



  

(f) To the extent that files or other materials maintained by Prior Company
Counsel constitute property of its clients, only the Holder Representative
and the Company Advised Parties shall hold such property rights and Prior
Company Counsel shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such files or
other materials or any Privileged Company Deal Communications by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Prior Company Counsel, on the one hand,
and the Surviving Corporation, on the other hand so long as such files or
other materials would be subject to a privilege or protection if they were
being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party. To the extent
that files or other materials maintained by Prior PTAC Counsel constitute
property of its clients, only the Sponsor and the PTAC Advised Parties shall
hold such property rights and Prior PTAC Counsel shall have no duty to reveal
or disclose any such files or other materials or any Privileged PTAC Deal
Communications by reason of any attorney-client relationship between Prior
PTAC Counsel, on the one hand, and PTAC, on the other hand so long as such
files or other materials would be subject to a privilege or protection if
they were being requested in a proceeding by an unrelated third party.

  



  

(g) PTAC agrees on behalf of itself and the Surviving Corporation, (i) to the
extent that PTAC or the Surviving Corporation receives or takes physical
possession of any Company Deal Communications or PTAC Deal Communications, (a)
such physical possession or receipt shall not, in any way, be deemed a waiver
by any of the Company Advised Parties, PTAC Advised Parties or any other
Person, of the privileges or protections described in this _Section 8.20_,
and (b) neither PTAC nor the Surviving Corporation shall assert any claim
that any of the Company Advised Parties, PTAC Advised Parties or any other
