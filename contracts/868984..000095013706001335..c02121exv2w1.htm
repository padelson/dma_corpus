and in the best interests of their respective stockholders that Holdco acquire the Company upon the
terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement and the other documents and
agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including: the execution of the Amended
and Restated Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the &#147;<B>Bridge Loan
Agreement</B>&#148; and together with Amendment No.&nbsp;2 (as defined in recital D below) and this Agreement,
the <B>&#147;Transaction Documents&#148;</B>) pursuant to which PWJ Lending LLC (&#147;<B>PWJ Lending</B>&#148;), an affiliate of

things, to extend the maturity of certain loan obligations outstanding under a Bridge Term Loan
Credit Agreement (the &#147;<B>Original Bridge Loan Agreement</B>&#148;) dated October&nbsp;3, 2005 among, the Company,
PWJ Lending as Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent and the other lenders thereto and to make

stock, par value $0.001 per share (the <B>&#147;Common Stock&#148;</B>), of the Company for $1.60 per share of

the Offer and the Merger (as defined below), and the Board has determined that such approval is
sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement the restriction against the parties hereto engaging in
any business combination as set forth in Section&nbsp;203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law
(<B>&#147;DGCL&#148;</B>) and has determined that this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its
stockholders, and has resolved to recommend that holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their
Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Purchaser, Parent and Holtzman shall commence (within the meaning of Rule&nbsp;14d-2 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the <B>&#147;Exchange Act&#148;</B>)) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the

of the Exchange Act) from the date of this Agreement and the Offer shall remain open at least
twenty (20)&nbsp;business days from commencement of the Offer (the <B>&#147;Initial Expiration Date&#148;</B>). The
obligation of Purchaser, and the obligation of Parent and Holtzman to cause Purchaser, to accept
for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of
the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the
following conditions: (i)&nbsp;there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of

single class, outstanding on the date such Shares are purchased (the <B>&#147;Minimum Condition&#148;</B>); and (ii)

all Shares tendered and not withdrawn as soon as it is legally permitted to do so under applicable
Law. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the <B>&#147;Offer to Purchase&#148;</B>) that
contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set
forth in <U>Annex A</U> hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of such

Purchaser&#146;s ability to effectively exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares; provided that
Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser shall have used their best efforts to have any of the foregoing
vacated, dismissed or withdrawn; or

with respect to any other facts and circumstances. Each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right which may be asserted at any time or from time to time.
