Exhibit 2.1 

   

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER 

   

 This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of February 1, 2006 (the "Effective Date"), by and among Whitehall Jewellers, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Prentice Capital Management, LP, a Delaware limited partnership ("Parent"), Holtzman Opportunity Fund, L.P. ("Holtzman") WJ Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and affiliate of Parent and Holtzman ("Holdco"), and WJ Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco ("Purchaser"). 

  

WITNESSETH: 

   

 A. The respective Boards of Directors of Holdco, Purchaser and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders that Holdco acquire the Company upon the terms and subject to the conditions provided for in this Agreement and the other documents and agreements entered into in connection with this Agreement, including: the execution of the Amended and Restated Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement dated as of the date hereof (the "Bridge Loan Agreement" and together with Amendment No. 2 (as defined in recital D below) and this Agreement, the "Transaction Documents") pursuant to which PWJ Lending LLC ("PWJ Lending"), an affiliate of Parent, as Collateral and Administrative agent and the lenders thereto, has agreed, among other things, to extend the maturity of certain loan obligations outstanding under a Bridge Term Loan Credit Agreement (the "Original Bridge Loan Agreement") dated October 3, 2005 among, the Company, PWJ Lending as Collateral Agent and Administrative Agent and the other lenders thereto and to make an additional $20 million loan to the Company for working capital and general corporate purposes. 

  

 B. In furtherance thereof, it is proposed that the acquisition be accomplished by Purchaser commencing a cash tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase and acquire all shares of the issued and outstanding common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the "Common Stock"), of the Company for $1.60 per share of Common Stock (such amount or any greater amount per share of Common Stock paid pursuant to the Offer being hereinafter referred to as the "Offer Price," and the shares of Common Stock being hereinafter referred to as the "Shares"), subject to any applicable withholding for Taxes (as such term is defined in Section 2.16(g)), net to the seller in cash, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 C. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") has unanimously approved the Agreement, the Offer and the Merger (as defined below), and the Board has determined that such approval is sufficient to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement the restriction against the parties hereto engaging in any business combination as set forth in Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law ("DGCL") and has determined that this Agreement, the Offer and the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby are fair to and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and has resolved to recommend that holders of Shares accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser pursuant to the Offer and adopt this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 D. The Company and its rights agent have, as of the Effective Date, executed Amendment No. 2 ("Amendment No. 2") to that certain Amended and Restated Stockholders Rights Agreement (the "Rights Agreement"), dated as of April 28, 1999, between the Company and BankBoston, N.A., and such amendment has not been amended or otherwise modified since the date thereof. 

  

 F. The general partners of each of Parent and Holtzman (on their own behalf and as the sole stockholders of Holdco), and the Board of Directors of each of Holdco (on its own behalf and as the sole stockholder of Purchaser), Purchaser and the Company have each approved this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the merger of Purchaser with and into the Company (the "Merger"), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation in the Merger in accordance with the DGCL and, in each such case, upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 

  

 G. By virtue of the provisions of this Agreement, that certain Securities Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase Agreement"), dated as of October 3, 2005, between the Company, PWJ Funding LLC, an affiliate of Parent, PWJ Lending, and Holtzman is terminated effective upon execution of this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

   ##### 

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 TERMS OF THE MERGER 

   

1.1. The Offer. 

   

 (a) Purchaser, Parent and Holtzman shall commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) the Offer as promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Date, but in no event later than five (5) business days (as defined in Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the Exchange Act) from the date of this Agreement and the Offer shall remain open at least twenty (20) business days from commencement of the Offer (the "Initial Expiration Date"). The obligation of Purchaser, and the obligation of Parent and Holtzman to cause Purchaser, to accept for payment and to pay for any Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the following conditions: (i) there being validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Common Stock which, together with any shares of Common Stock then owned by Holdco, Purchaser, and/or Parent and Holtzman and their respective affiliates, represents at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of the Shares and the shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company ("Class B Shares"), voting together as a single class, outstanding on the date such Shares are purchased (the "Minimum Condition"); and (ii) the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto. Purchaser shall, on the terms and subject to the prior satisfaction or waiver by Parent or Purchaser of the Minimum Condition and the other conditions of the Offer set forth in _Annex A_ hereto, accept for payment and pay for all Shares tendered and not withdrawn as soon as it is legally permitted to do so under applicable Law. The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") that contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, the Minimum Condition and the other conditions set forth in _Annex A_ hereto. Purchaser expressly reserves the right to waive any of such conditions, to increase the Offer Price and to make any other changes in the terms of the Offer;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall not, and Parent and Holtzman shall cause Purchaser not to, decrease the Offer Price, change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, decrease the number of Shares sought in the offer, impose additional conditions to the Offer, extend the Offer beyond the Initial Expiration Date, waive the Minimum Condition or amend any other term or condition of the Offer in any manner adverse to the holders of the Shares, in each case without the prior written consent of the Company (such consent to be authorized by the Board or a duly authorized committee thereof). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser may, without the consent of the Company, prior to the termination of this Agreement, extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation or interpretation of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), or the staff thereof, applicable to the Offer. If, at any scheduled expiration of the Offer, any condition to the Offer is not satisfied, including, without limitation, the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, Holdco shall, and Parent shall cause Holdco to, extend the Offer for one or more periods of not more than five (5) business days each. Purchaser may also, without the consent of the Company, or if requested by the Company shall, extend the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent shall not extend the Offer in accordance with Rule 14d-11 if the Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to the scheduled expiration of the Offer (taken together with Shares and Class B Shares then owned by Parent, Holtzman, Holdco, 

   ##### 

  

 

Purchaser and any of their subsidiaries and affiliates) constitute in the
aggregate 90% or greater of the aggregate voting power of the Shares and the
Class B Shares. Parent and Holtzman shall provide or cause to be provided to
the Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of
Common Stock that the Purchaser becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable (but in no event later than five (5) business days after the date hereof), Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer. The Schedule TO shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase and forms of the related letter of transmittal and all other ancillary Offer documents (collectively, together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). The Schedule TO shall reflect the existence of this Agreement. Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser shall take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the holders of the Shares as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser will take all necessary steps to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review the Schedule TO before it is filed with the SEC. In addition, Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and its counsel in writing any comments or other communications, whether written or oral, that Parent, Holtzman or Purchaser or their counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments or other communications and to notify the Company and its counsel a reasonable time prior to responding to any such comments. 

  

1.2. Company Actions. 

   

 (a) The Company hereby approves of and consents to the Offer and represents and warrants that the Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has (i) determined that the terms of the Offer and the Merger are fair to and in the best interests of the stockholders of the Company, (ii) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) subject to Section 4.8, resolved to recommend that the stockholders of the Company accept the Offer, tender their Shares to Purchaser thereunder and adopt this Agreement. The Company hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Board described in the immediately preceding sentence, and the Company shall not permit the recommendation of the Companys Board to be modified in any manner adverse to Parent or Purchaser or to be withdrawn by the Companys Board, except as provided in Section 4.8 hereof. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable from the date of commencement of the Offer, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") which shall contain the recommendation referred to in clause (iii) of Section 1.2(a) hereof, subject to Section 

   ##### 

  

 

4.8. The Company further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of the Shares as and to the
extent required by applicable federal securities laws. The Company, on the
one hand, and each of Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser, on the other hand, will
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9
if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any
material respect, and the Company will take all steps necessary to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be
disseminated to holders of the Shares, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities laws. Parent, Holtzman, Purchaser
and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC. In addition,
the Company agrees to provide Parent, Purchaser, Holtzman and their counsel
in writing any comments or other communications, whether written or oral,
that the Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of
such comments or other communications and, subject to the
fiduciary obligation of the Board, to consult with Parent, Purchaser,
Holtzman and their counsel a reasonable time prior to responding to any such
comments. 

   

 (c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall promptly furnish Purchaser with mailing labels containing the names and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position listings of Shares held in stock depositories, each as of a recent date, together with all other available listings and computer files containing names, addresses and security position listings of record holders and non-objecting beneficial owners of Shares. The Company shall furnish Purchaser with such additional information in the Companys possession or control, including, without limitation, updated listings and computer files of holders of Shares, mailing labels and security position listings, and such other assistance as Parent, Purchaser, Holtzman or their agents may reasonably require in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall hold in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information then in their possession or the possession of its agents or representatives. 

  

1.3. Directors of the Company. 

   

 (a) Immediately upon the purchase of and payment for Shares by Parent, Purchaser, Holtzman or any of their affiliates pursuant to the Offer following satisfaction of the Minimum Condition, Purchaser shall be entitled to designate such total number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the Board as is equal to the product obtained by multiplying the total number of directors on such Board by the percentage that the number of Shares so purchased and paid for bears to the total number of Shares then outstanding, but in no event less than a majority of the number of directors. In furtherance thereof, the Company and its Board of Directors shall, after the purchase of and payment for Shares by Purchaser or any of its affiliates pursuant to the Offer, upon request of Purchaser, immediately increase the size of its Board of Directors, or at the Companys election secure the resignations of such number of directors or remove such number of directors or any combination of the foregoing, as is necessary to enable Purchasers designees to be so elected to the Companys Board and shall cause Purchasers designees to be 

   ##### 

  

 

so elected and shall comply with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder in connection therewith. Immediately upon the
first purchase of and payment for Shares by Purchaser or any of its
affiliates pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall, if requested
by Purchaser, also cause directors designated by Purchaser to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) of each
committee of the Board as is on the Board. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
Shares are purchased pursuant to the Offer, the Company shall use its best
efforts to assure that there shall be until the Effective Time (as hereinafter
defined) at least two of the members of the Board who are directors on the
date hereof and are not employees of the Company (each a "Continuing
Director"). In addition to any indemnification rights pursuant to this
Agreement or the Companys Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the
"Certificate of Incorporation") and Bylaws, the Continuing Directors as a
group shall be entitled to retain independent legal counsel at Company
expense if and to the extent that issues are presented to them that involve a
conflict of interest for Company counsel. The Company and its Board of
Directors shall promptly take all actions as may be necessary to comply with
their obligations under this Section 1.3(a). If at any time prior to the
Effective Time there shall be in office only one Continuing Director for any
reason, the Board shall be entitled to appoint a person who is not an officer
or employee of the Company or any subsidiary designated by the remaining
Continuing Director to fill such vacancy (and such person shall be deemed to
be a Continuing Director for all purposes of this Agreement), and if at any
time prior to the Effective Time no Continuing Directors then remain, the
other directors of the Company then in office shall use their best efforts
to designate two persons to fill such vacancies who are not officers or
employees or affiliates of the Company, its subsidiaries, or Parent,
Holtzman, Holdco or Purchaser or any of their respective affiliates (and such
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of
this Agreement). The Companys obligations under this Section 1.3 shall be
subject to (i) Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder, (ii) Purchaser providing to the Company on a timely basis all
information required to be included in the information statement
thereunder with respect to Purchasers designees and (iii) compliance with
any director independence or other qualifications required by applicable law
or the non-prosecution agreement dated September 28, 2004 between the United
States Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of New York and the
Company.

 (a) Each Share or Class B Share that is owned by Parent, Holdco, Holtzman or Purchaser or any wholly owned subsidiary of Parent or Holtzman, or that is owned by the Company as treasury stock, shall automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (b) Each issued and outstanding (i) Share (other than Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 1.6(a) hereof and Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.9 below)) 

   ##### 

  

 

shall automatically be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in
cash (the "Merger Consideration"), and (ii) Class B Share (other than Class B
Shares to be cancelled in accordance with Section 1.6(a) hereof and
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.9 below)) shall automatically be
converted into the right to receive the product of (x) 35.42083833 and
(y) the Offer Price (such product, the "Class B Merger Consideration"), in
each case in cash payable, without interest, to the holder of such Share or
such Class B Share, as applicable, upon surrender, in the manner provided in
Section 1.7 hereof, of the certificate that formerly evidenced such Share or
Class B Share. All such Shares and Class B Shares, when so converted, shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such
Shares or Class B Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration or the Class B Merger
Consideration, as applicable, therefor upon the surrender of such certificate
in accordance with Section 1.7 hereof. 

   

 (c) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Purchaser shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

1.7. Tender of and Payment for Certificates. 

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall designate a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as agent for the holders of the Shares and the Class B Shares (other than Shares held by Parent, Holdco, Purchaser, the Company, Holtzman and any of their respective subsidiaries and Dissenting Shares) in connection with the Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive in trust, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares and Class B Shares shall become entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof. Purchaser shall, and Parent and Holtzman shall cause Purchaser to, transfer and deposit such aggregate Merger Consideration with or for the account of the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.6(a)) immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such aggregate Merger Consideration shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Holdco. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent, Holtzman and the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be mailed to each holder of record, as of the Effective Time, of a certificate or certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares or Class B Shares (the "Certificates"), whose Shares or Class B Shares were converted pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each Share, or the Class B Merger Consideration for each Class B Share, formerly represented by such Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest 

   ##### 

  

 

will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of the
Certificates. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper
form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall have paid
all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the issuance to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have
established to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax
either has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 1.7, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for each Share, or the Class B Merger Consideration for each
Class B Share, in cash as contemplated by Section 1.6(b) hereof. 

   

 (c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares or Class B Shares on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates evidencing ownership of the Shares or Class B Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares or Class B Shares, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

  

 (d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) which had been made available to the Paying Agent, and holders shall be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar laws) only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their Certificates without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving Corporation nor the Paying Agent nor any party hereto shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for Merger Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate(s) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against any party hereto or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate(s), the Paying Agent will disburse the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.6(b) payable in respect of the Shares or Class B Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate(s). 

  

 (f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, from the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration payable to a holder of Shares pursuant to the Offer or the Merger, or from the Class B Merger Consideration payable to a holder of Class B Shares pursuant to the Merger, any such amounts as are required under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that 

   ##### 

  

 

amounts are so withheld by Parent, Holdco, Holtzman or Purchaser, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder of the Shares or Class B Shares, as
applicable, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made
by Parent, Holdco or Purchaser. 

   

1.8. Options. 

   

 (a) With respect to all outstanding options to purchase Shares ("Company Options") granted under the Companys 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Companys 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan (collectively, the "Company LTIP Plans"), all Restricted Stock Awards (as defined in any Company LTIP Plan) issued under the Company LTIP Plans and all outstanding Company Options granted under the Employment Agreement dated October 31, 2005 between the Company and Robert L. Baumgardner (the "Employment Agreement"), the Company shall comply with its payment obligations, if any, under each Company LTIP Plan and the Employment Agreement with respect to any "Change in Control" (as defined in such Company LTIP Plan or the Employment Agreement, as applicable) occurring as a result of the Offer, the Company Stockholder Approval or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or by the other Transaction Documents. 

  

 (b) With respect to all Company Options granted under the Companys 1998 Non-Employee Directors Stock Option Plan, as amended (the "Non-Employee Directors Plan" and, together with the Companys 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the Companys 1997 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the "Company Option Plans"), at the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions set forth below in this Section 1.8(b), each holder of a Company Option granted under the Non-Employee Directors Plan (the "Non-Employee Director Options") will be entitled to receive from the Company, and shall receive, promptly following the Effective Time, in settlement of each Non-Employee Director Option a Cash Amount. The "Cash Amount" shall be equal to the net amount of (A) the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Non-Employee Director Option at the Effective Time, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares subject to such Non-Employee Director Option, less (B) any applicable withholdings for Taxes. If the exercise price per share of any Non-Employee Director Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor shall be zero. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any person subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, any Cash Amount to be paid to such person in accordance with this Section 1.8(b) shall be paid as soon as practicable after the payment can be made without liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act. 

  

 (c) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that, as of and after the Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 1.8, (i) all rights under any Company Option and any provision of the Company Option Plans and any other plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be cancelled and (ii) no person shall have any right under the Company Option Plans or any other plan, program or arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof. 

  

 (d) At or before the Effective Time, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be effected any necessary amendments to the Company Option Plans and any 

   ##### 

  

 

other resolutions, consents or notices, in such form reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, required under the Company Option Plans or any Company Options to
give effect to the foregoing provisions of this Section 1.8. 

   

1.9. Dissenting Shares. 

   

 Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, each outstanding Share or Class B Share, the holder of which has demanded and perfected such holders right to dissent from the Merger and to be paid the fair value of such Shares or Class B Shares in accordance with the DGCL and, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such dissenters rights ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be converted into or represent a right to receive the Merger Consideration into which Shares are converted, or the Class B Merger Consideration into which Class B Shares are converted, pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof, but the holder thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, if any holder of Shares or Class B Shares who demands dissenters rights with respect to its Shares or Class B Shares under the DGCL effectively withdraws or loses (through failure to perfect or otherwise) its dissenters rights, then as of the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever later occurs, such holders Shares or Class B Shares will automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 1.6(b) hereof, without interest thereon, upon surrender of the certificate or certificates formerly representing such Shares or Class B Shares. After the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Company to make all payments to holders of Shares or Class B Shares with respect to such demands in accordance with the DGCL. The Company shall give Purchaser (i) prompt written notice of any notice of intent to demand fair value for any Shares or Class B Shares, withdrawals of such notices, and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair value for Shares or Class B Shares under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for fair value for Shares or Class B Shares or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

1.10. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. 

   

 Subject to Section 5.4 hereof, at and after the Effective Time until the same have been duly amended, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Purchaser in effect at the Effective Time and (ii) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be identical to the Bylaws of Purchaser in effect at the Effective Time. 

  

1.11. Directors and Officers. 

   

 At and after the Effective Time, the directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and the officers of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, except as the Purchaser shall otherwise provide in writing, in each case until their successors are elected or appointed and qualified. If, at the Effective Time, a vacancy shall exist on the Board of 

   ##### 

  

 

Directors or in any office of the Surviving Corporation, such vacancy may
thereafter be filled in the manner provided by law. 

   

1.12. Other Effects of Merger. 

   

 The Merger shall have all further effects as specified in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. 

  

1.13. Additional Actions.

For the avoidance of doubt, the term "Indebtedness" under this Agreement shall not be deemed to include any amounts owed not relating to Indebtedness for borrowed money, under the Companys merchandising consignment agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business.

The Company is not, to its knowledge, making unauthorized use of any confidential information or trade secrets of any third party, and the Company has not received any notice of any asserted infringement (nor is the Company aware of any reasonable basis for any third party asserting an infringement) by the Company in any material respect of, any rights of a third party with respect to any Intellectual Property Rights.

   ##### 

  

 

confidentiality, disclosure or proprietary information agreement, non-

covenant, and the continued employment of each such executive officer does
not subject the Company or any of its subsidiaries to any liability with
respect to any of the foregoing matters.

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 4.8, in the event that, prior to the time of the first acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, the Company receives an unsolicited bona fide written Competing Transaction (under circumstances in which the Company has complied with its obligations under Section 4.8(a)(i)) with respect to itself from a third party that its Board has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of the advice of its reputable outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of recognized reputation) (i) that such Competing Transaction is, or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior Proposal and (ii) that the failure to provide nonpublic information or data concerning the Company or participate in negotiations or discussions concerning such Competing Transaction would result in a breach by the Board of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders or creditors under applicable law, it may then take the following actions: (1) furnish nonpublic information to the third party making such Competing Transaction, provided that (A) concurrently with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives Purchaser written notice of its intention to furnish such nonpublic information, (B) it receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic information furnished to such third party on its behalf, the terms of which are at least as restrictive on the third party as the terms contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and containing additional provisions that expressly permit the Company to comply with the provisions of this Section 4.8) and (C) contemporaneously with furnishing any nonpublic information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic information to Purchaser (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been previously so furnished); and (2) engage in negotiations with the third party with respect to the Competing Transaction, provided that concurrently with entering into negotiations with such third party, it gives Purchaser written notice of its intention to enter into negotiations with such third party.

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Board shall be permitted, at any time prior to the time of the first acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Competing Transaction (a copy of which shall be provided to Purchaser within 24 hours of receipt thereof, including any amendments or modifications thereto), to approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any Competing Transaction and, subject to the Company first exercising its right to terminate this Agreement under Section 7.1(g), enter into a bona fide agreement contemplating a 

   ##### 

  

 

Competing Transaction, and in connection therewith, to withdraw, modify or

consultation with the Companys financial advisor of recognized reputation
and reputable outside legal counsel that such Competing Transaction
constitutes a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company shall promptly (but in no
event later than 24 hours after the Board reaches such conclusion) have given
written notice to Purchaser advising Purchaser that the Company has received
a Superior Proposal from a third party, specifying the material terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal and (iii) either (A) Purchaser shall
not have revised its proposal with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby within (x) 10 business days after the date on which such notice is
deemed to have been given to Purchaser or (y) in the event of any counter-
proposal with respect to such Competing Transaction from a third party that
has previously submitted a Superior Proposal, three business days after the
date on which notice of such counter-proposal is deemed to have been given to
Purchaser or (B) if Purchaser within such period shall have revised its
proposal with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, the
Board, after consultation with the Companys financial advisor of recognized
reputation and reputable outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good
faith that the third partys Competing Transaction is a Superior Proposal
relative to Purchasers revised proposal. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or its Board from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act to the extent required by applicable law; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such disclosure relating to a Competing Transaction shall be deemed a Company Change in Recommendation unless the Board reaffirms its Recommendation in such disclosure. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Board or any committee thereof from making a Company Change in Recommendation if the Board or such committee concludes in good faith after consultation with reputable legal counsel that the failure to do would result in a breach by the Board or such committee of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders or creditors. 

  

 (f) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing solicitation, initiation, encouragement, activity, discussion or negotiation with any parties conducted heretofore by the Company or any of its Representatives with respect to any Competing Transactions existing on the date of this Agreement. The Company will promptly notify Purchaser if the Company (or any of its Representatives) receives any such Competing Transactions and the details thereof, and keep Purchaser informed with respect to each such Competing Proposal. 

  

 (g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean a Competing Transaction that the Board has in good faith concluded (following the receipt of advice of its reputable outside legal counsel and its financial advisor of recognized reputation), taking into account, among other things, all legal, financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal and the person or group making the proposal, to be more favorable, from a financial point of view, to the Company, its stockholders and creditors, taken as a whole, than the terms of this Agreement and is reasonably capable of being consummated.

 The Company shall send to Purchaser a copy of all public reports and materials as and when it sends the same to its stockholders, the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission. 

  

4.10. State Takeover Laws; Rights Amendment. 

   

 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, if any state takeover statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, the Company and the members of its Board will use all reasonable efforts to grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Transaction Documents may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effect of any takeover statute on any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents. The Company shall not amend the Rights Agreement or Amendment No. 2 without Parents prior written consent during the term of this Agreement; provided; however that any such amendment, if at all, will not retroactively cause Parent, Holtzman, Holdco, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or Associates (as such terms is defined in the Rights Agreement) to be deemed Acquiring Persons (as such terms is defined in the Rights Agreement) solely by reason of their Beneficial Ownership (as such terms is defined in the Rights Agreement) of Shares as of the date hereof.

 Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the Company if any of the following occur after the date of this Agreement: (i) any representation or warranty made by Parent, Holdco, Holtzman or Purchaser in this Agreement is untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date hereof to the Effective Time; (ii) there has been a material failure of Parent, Holdco, Holtzman or Purchaser or any of their respective representatives to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it or them hereunder; (iii) receipt of any notice or other communication in writing from any third party alleging that the Consent of such third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, provided that such Consent would have been required to have been disclosed in this Agreement; (iv) receipt of any material notice or other communication from any Governmental Authority (including, but not limited to, the NASD) in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents; (v) the occurrence of an event which would reasonably be expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect; or (vi) the commencement or threat of any Litigation involving or affecting Parent, Holtzman or any of their respective 

   ##### 

  

 

subsidiaries, or any of their respective properties or assets, or, to its
knowledge, any employee, agent, director or officer, in his or her capacity
as such, of Parent, Holtzman or any of their respective subsidiaries which,
if pending on the date hereof, would have been required to have been
disclosed in this Agreement or which relates to the consummation of the Offer
or the Merger. No such notice to the Company shall have any effect on the
determination of whether or not any of the conditions to Closing or to the
consummation of the Offer have been satisfied or in determining whether or
not any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in
this Agreement have been breached. 

   

5.2. Best Efforts. 

   

 Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including, but not limited to: (i) obtaining all Consents from Governmental Authorities and other third parties required for the consummation of the offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents and (ii) consulting and cooperating with and providing assistance to the Company in the preparation and filing with the SEC of the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, if applicable, and all necessary amendments and supplements thereto. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each of Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser agrees to use best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary to satisfy the conditions to the consummation of the Offer and the Closing set forth herein, and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents. 

  

5.3. Compliance. 

   

 In consummating the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Transaction Documents, Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall comply, and cause their respective subsidiaries to comply or to be in compliance, in all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and all other applicable Laws. 

  

5.4. Indemnification. 

   

 (a) Each of Parent and Holtzman agrees that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors or officers or employees or agents (the "Company Indemnified Parties") of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or other entities, at the request of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, as provided in its charter or by-laws or in any agreement shall survive the Offer and the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms. For six years from the Effective Time (or, in the case of matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time that have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, until such matters are finally resolved), Parent and Holtzman shall indemnify the Company Indemnified Parties to the same extent as such Company Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification pursuant to the preceding sentence. As of the 

   ##### 

  

 

Effective Time, the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in
the Bylaws and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be at least as favorable to individuals who immediately prior to the
Closing Date were directors, officers, agents or employees of the Company or
otherwise entitled to indemnification under the Companys Bylaws or
Certificate of Incorporation (an "Indemnified Party") as those contained in
the Bylaws and the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, respectively,
and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six
(6) years after the Closing Date in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that nothing contained herein shall limit Purchasers ability to merge the
Company or the Surviving Corporation into Purchaser or any of its
subsidiaries or any other person or otherwise eliminate the Companys or the
Surviving Corporations corporate existence in each case provided that
the surviving entity shall assume the obligations of the Company or the
Surviving Corporation in accordance with _Section 5.4(c)_. The Company
hereby covenants that it shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware law and regardless of whether the Merger becomes
effective, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted under
Delaware law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, each Indemnified Party
against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, including, without limitation, liabilities arising out of this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or under the Exchange Act,
occurring through the Closing Date, and in the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), (i) the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay
the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified
Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, promptly as statements therefor are received, and (ii)
the Company and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of
any such matter; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and 
_provided_ , _further_ , that neither the Company nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be obliged pursuant to this Section 5.4 to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Parties in any
single action, except to the extent that, in the reasonable opinion of
counsel for the Indemnified Parties, two or more of such Indemnified Parties
have conflicting interests in the outcome of such action. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 5.4 or in the Bylaws or Certificate
of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, the foregoing indemnification
shall not be available to an Indemnified Party to the extent that a claim
arises in connection with facts or circumstances which, if known by Purchaser
prior to the Effective Time, would have constituted a breach of the Companys
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements made in this Agreement.
In the event that any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any actual or
threatened action, suit, claim, proceeding or investigation after the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall advance to such Indemnified Party his
or her legal and other expenses (including the cost of any investigation and
preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to the providing by
such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse all amounts so
advanced in the event of a determination of a court of competent jurisdiction
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time; or (ii) maintain in effect for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage, amounts and retentions with substantially comparable insurers containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the insured) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to make annual premium payments for such insurance in excess of two times the annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance as of the date hereof ("Companys Current Premium"), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time exceed two times the Companys Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporations good faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual premium equal to two times the Companys Current Premium. The Company represents that the amount of Companys Current Premium is set forth in _Section 5.4(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. 

  

 (c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.4. 

  

 (d) The provisions of this Section 5.4 (i) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

  

5.5. Benefit Plans and Employee Matters. 

   

 (a) Purchaser shall, to the extent practicable, either maintain and provide to the Companys employees who continue employment with Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any subsidiary thereof, the employee benefits and programs of the Company as substantially in effect as of the date hereof or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide employee benefits and programs to such employees that, in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to those of the Company. The Company shall provide Purchaser with such information as Purchaser may reasonably request regarding the Companys employee benefits and programs in order to assist Purchaser in complying with its obligations under this Section 5.5(a). Nothing in this Section 5.5(a) shall be construed to prohibit or restrict Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation from amending, suspending or terminating any of its employee benefit plans or programs at any time. Nothing in this Section 5.5 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a right in any employee to employment with Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or any of their subsidiaries and the employment of each such employee shall be "at will" employment, except to the extent otherwise provided in a written employment agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall honor, in accordance with their terms, all employment and severance agreements listed in _Section 5.5(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date that are applicable to any current or former employees or directors of the Company. To the knowledge of the Company as of the date of the Agreement, there are no other material written employment or severance agreements to which the Company is a party. 

  

5.6. Public Announcements. 

   

 So long as this Agreement is in effect, Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their affiliates to, consult with the Company before issuing, and provide the Company the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or any other public announcement with respect to this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Offer or the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or public announcement prior to such consultation, except as required by applicable Law or regulatory authority. 

  

5.7. [Intentionally Omitted]. 

   

5.8. No Disposition of Shares; Obligation to Vote. 

   

 During the time this Agreement is in effect, Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall not, and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates to, sell, pledge, assign, encumber, grant any proxy or enter into any voting or similar agreement with respect to, transfer or otherwise dispose of (collectively, "Transfer"), or agree to Transfer, any Shares or Class B Shares owned by them as of the date hereof or subsequently acquired by them, or take any other action that would restrict, limit or interfere with their obligations under this Agreement or any of the Transaction Documents. Parent, Holdco, Holtzman and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries and affiliates to, vote, or cause to be voted, all of the Shares acquired in the Offer and all Shares and Class B Shares otherwise owned by any of them or their subsidiaries and affiliates in favor of the approval and adoption of the Merger and this Agreement.

7.1. Termination. 

   

 This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger and the other transactions may be abandoned at any time prior to the time of the first acceptance of Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer ("First Acceptance Time") by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors or general partner, as the case may be, of the terminating party or parties, as follows (the date of any such termination, the "Termination Date"):

 (d) by Purchaser, following twenty (20) days prior notice of the occurrence of an Extremely Detrimental Effect, to the extent such Extremely Detrimental Effect has not been cured during such twenty (20) day period; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this clause (d), any adverse effect on the continued availability of employees or relationships with vendors arising out of the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall not be taken into account in determining whether an Extremely Detrimental Effect has occurred.

8.5. Binding Effect; Assignment. 

   

 (a) Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto prior to the Effective Time, without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Each of Holdco, Purchaser and Holtzman (collectively with Parent, the "Buyers") hereby appoints the Parent to act as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of the Buyers with respect to the taking of any and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by any of Parent, Holdco, Purchaser or Holtzman under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including, without limitation, the power to (i) arbitrate, resolve, settle or compromise any dispute regarding indemnification claims or matters arising out of this Agreement and (ii) take all actions necessary in the judgment of Parent for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, 

   ##### 

  

 

Parent will not be liable to any Buyer in the absence of fraud or willful
misconduct on the part of Parent, and, as between Parent and the Buyers, any
act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of Parent good faith. Each of Parent and Holtzman confirms that it
has had the opportunity to independently participate in the negotiation of
the transaction contemplated hereby with the advice of its own counsel and
advisors. Holtzman acknowledges that (i) Schulte Roth and Zabel LLP solely
represented Parent in connection with the transaction contemplated hereby and
(ii) Parent did not provide any advice in connection herewith and Holtzmans
determination to participate herein was based solely on its own evaluation of
the risks and merits of the investment contemplated hereby. 

   

 (b) Parent agrees to be jointly and severally responsible for any failure on the part of Holtzman, Holdco or Purchaser to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and for any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant on the part of any of Holtzman, Holdco or Purchaser. 

  

8.6. Governing Law.

8.7. Counterparts. 

   

 This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which together shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer, Purchaser is not required to accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Purchasers obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after termination or expiration of the Offer), pay for, and may delay the acceptance for payment of or, subject to the restriction referred to above, the payment for, any Shares, and may terminate or amend the Offer (but only subject to and in accordance with the Agreement, if (1) the Minimum Tender Condition has not been satisfied or (2) if at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and prior to the expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions exist and continue to exist at the expiration of the Offer: 

  

 (i) any order, statute, rule, regulation, executive order, stay, decree, judgment or injunction shall have been enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by any court or other Governmental Authority since the date of this Agreement, which prohibits or prevents the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or imposes material limitations on Parents, Holtzmans or Purchasers ability to effectively exercise full rights of ownership of the Shares; provided that Parent, Holtzman and Purchaser shall have used their best efforts to have any of the foregoing vacated, dismissed or withdrawn; or 

  

 (ii) any event, circumstances or fact shall have occurred which has resulted in, would result in or could reasonably be expected to result in, individually or in the aggregate, an Extremely Detrimental Effect on the business, properties, assets, operations, results of operations or condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole;  _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this clause (ii), any adverse effect on the continued availability of employees or relationships with vendors arising out of the announcement or pendency of this Agreement, the other Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall not be taken into account in determining whether an Extremely Detrimental Effect has occurred or could reasonably be expected to occur; or 

  

 (iii) the Company or any of its subsidiaries has (a) issued or sold, or authorized or proposed the issuance or sale of, any additional Shares, shares of any other class or series of capital stock, other voting securities or any securities convertible into, or options, rights or warrants, conditional or otherwise, to acquire, any of the foregoing (other than the issuance of Shares pursuant to and in accordance with the terms in effect on the date of the Agreement, of warrants and Company Stock Options outstanding prior to such date), or any other securities or rights in respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution or exchange for any shares of its capital stock, (b) declared or paid (or the Board proposes to declare or pay) any dividend or other distribution on any shares of capital stock of the Company (other than a distribution of the Rights certificates or a redemption of the Rights in accordance with the Rights Agreement as publicly disclosed to be in effect prior to the date of the Agreement), (c) altered or entered into an agreement to alter any material term of any outstanding security, issued or sold, or authorized or entered into an agreement to issue or sell, any debt securities or otherwise incurred or authorized or entered into

an agreement to incur any debt other than in the ordinary course of business
(other than to amend the Rights Agreement to make the Rights inapplicable to
the Offer and the Merger or in accordance with agreements contemplated by the
Transaction Documents), (d) entered into or amended any employment, severance
or similar agreement, arrangement or plan with any of its officers other than
in the ordinary course of business or entered into or amended any such
agreements, arrangements or plans so as to provide for increased benefits to
employees as a result of or in connection with the making of the Offer, the
acceptance for payment of or payment for some of or all the Shares by
Purchaser or the consummation of the Merger, or (e) amended its certificate
of incorporation or bylaws other than to amend the Rights Agreement to make
the Rights inapplicable to the Offer and the Merger; or 

   

 (iv) the Company or any of its subsidiaries shall have (a) granted after the date of the Agreement to any person proposing a Competing Transaction any material option, warrant or similar right (including, without limitation, a right to acquire or receive any Shares or other securities, assets or business of the Company or any of its subsidiaries) or (b) paid or agreed to pay any material cash or other consideration to any party that has proposed a Competing Transaction in connection with or in any way related to any such Competing Transaction which, in Purchasers reasonable judgment, in any such case, and regardless of the circumstances (including any action or omission by Parent, Holtzman or Purchaser) giving rise to any such condition, makes it inadvisable to proceed with such acceptance for payment or payment. 

  

 The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent, Purchaser, Holtzman and their affiliates and may be asserted by Parent, Holtzman or Purchaser in their reasonable discretion regardless of the circumstances (excluding any affirmative action or omission by Parent, Holtzman or Purchaser) giving rise to any such conditions or may be waived by Parent, Holtzman or Purchaser in their reasonable discretion in whole or in part at any time or from time to time before the Expiration Date (but only subject to and in accordance with the Agreement). Purchaser, Holtzman and Parent expressly reserve the right to waive any of the conditions to the Offer and to make any change in the terms of or conditions to the Offer (but only subject to and in accordance with the Agreement). The failure by Parent, Holtzman or Purchaser at any time to exercise their rights under any of the foregoing conditions shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances. Each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right which may be asserted at any time or from time to time.
