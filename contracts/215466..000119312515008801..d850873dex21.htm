Buyer shall pay the difference to Seller by wire transfer within five Business
Days of the final determination of the Closing Statement. The determination

any of the parties may have with respect to the representations, warranties,
covenants and indemnities in its favor contained in this Agreement.

employees or officers of the Acquired Companies or the beneficiaries or
dependents of any such Persons, or that is maintained, sponsored, contributed
to, or required to be contributed to by the Acquired Companies, or under
which the Acquired Companies have any liability (as listed on _Section
3.12(a)(i)_ of the Disclosure Letter, each, a " _Benefit Plan_ "). Except as
set forth in  _Section 3.12(a)(ii)_ of the Disclosure Letter, each Benefit
Plan has been maintained in all material respects in accordance with its terms

thereunder or any fiduciary thereof is, to the Knowledge of Seller, the
subject of an audit, investigation or examination by any governmental
authority and no action or claims (other than routine claims for benefits) are
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened, anticipated or expected to
be asserted with respect to any Benefit Plan or with respect to any Acquired
Company as the sponsor or fiduciary thereof or with respect to any other
fiduciary thereof.

(e) None of the Acquired Companies maintains any Benefit Plan which is a
"group health plan," as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code, that has not been administered and operated in all material respects in
compliance with the applicable requirements of Section 601 of ERISA, Section
4980B(b) of the Code and the applicable provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1986 and the Patient Protection and

material tax, interest or penalty thereunder and (ii) the document or
documents that evidence each such plan or arrangement have conformed in all
material respects to the provisions of Section 409A of the Code and the final
regulations under Section 409A of the Code since December 31, 2008.

 

(g) The consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether alone or
in connection with any other event, will not result in any payments,
including under any Benefit Plan, that reasonably could be expected to be
"excess parachute payments" pursuant to Section 280G of the Code.

 

(h) The Acquired Companies are not bound by any collective bargaining or other
agreement with a labor organization representing any of the Employees. There
are no, and during the past five years have been no, organizing activities or
collective bargaining arrangements that could affect any Acquired Company
pending or under discussion with any labor organization or group of employees
of any Acquired Company. There is no, and during the past five years there
has been no, labor dispute, strike, controversy, slowdown, work stoppage or
lockout pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened against or
affecting any Acquired Company, nor is there any basis for any of the
foregoing. The Acquired Companies are in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Laws pertaining to employment and employment practices,
wages, overtime classification, hours, occupational safety and health,
employee whistle-blowing, immigration, employee privacy, and classification of
employees, consultants and independent contractors.

 

(i) There has not been, and Seller does not anticipate or have any reason to
believe that there will be, any material adverse change in relations with
Employees as a result of the announcement of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. To the Knowledge of Seller as of the date of this Agreement,
no current Employee with the job classification of M1, M2, M3, E4 or S1
or officer of any Acquired Company intends, or is expected, to terminate his
or her employment relationship with such entity following the consummation of

such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

5.11 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration, value added and other such Taxes and fees (including any
penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement (including
any real property transfer Tax and any other similar Tax) shall be borne and
paid 50% by Seller and 50% by Buyer when due. The party customarily
responsible under applicable Law shall, at its own expense, timely file any
Tax Return or other document with respect to such Taxes or fees (and the other
party shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

 

5.12 _Replacement Reclamation Bonds_. At least 30 days prior to Closing,
Seller and Buyer will meet with the relevant state and federal agencies with

Closing, Buyer shall deliver to Seller evidence that Buyer has obtained,
subject only to Closing, substitute guarantees, letters of credit, bonds,
security deposits, or other surety obligations and evidence of financial
capacity, in each case acceptable to the relevant agencies in replacement of
the Reclamation Bonds (the " _Replacement Bonds_ "). Within five business days
after the Closing, Buyer shall deliver to the applicable state and federal

reasonable efforts to cause such agencies to fully and unconditionally release
Seller and its Affiliates from all obligations relating to the Reclamation
Bonds and any liabilities related thereto.

Affiliate of Seller (other than an Acquired Company), and (b) all
intercompany and intracompany accounts or contracts between the Acquired
Companies, on the one hand, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Companies), on the other hand, shall be cancelled without any
consideration or further liability to any party and without the need for any
further documentation (collectively, the " _Affiliate Arrangements_ ").

 

5.14 _Exclusivity_. Seller agrees that between the date of this Agreement and
the earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, Seller
shall not, and shall take all action necessary to ensure that none of the
Acquired Companies nor any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives
shall, directly or indirectly:

 

(a) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or accept any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the capital stock or other equity or
ownership interest of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or assets of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than inventory to be sold in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) to enter into
any merger, consolidation or other business combination relating to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (iii) to enter into a recapitalization,
reorganization or any other extraordinary business transaction involving or
otherwise relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or

(b) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the foregoing. Seller immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing.

Seller shall notify Buyer promptly, but in any event within five Business
Days, if any such proposal or offer, or any inquiry or other contact with any
Person with respect thereto that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
proposal or offer, is made. Any such notice to Buyer shall indicate in
reasonable detail the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact. Seller shall not, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies not to, release any Person from, or waive any provision of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which Seller or the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party, without the prior written consent of
Buyer.

 

5.15 _Effect of Closing_. If the Closing occurs, other than in respect of
Sellers covenants in Section 5.1 (Conduct of Business Prior to the Closing),
Section 5.13 (Payment of Indebtedness; Affiliate Arrangements) and Section
5.16 (Cooperation), (i) the covenants and other agreements in this Agreement
that are to be performed by Seller prior to the Closing Date shall not
survive; (ii) Seller shall have no liability with respect to such covenants
and agreements; and (iii) Buyer shall have no claims against Seller for breach
or nonperformance of such covenants and agreements.

 



29 5.16 _Cooperation_. Seller understands and acknowledges that after the
Closing, Buyer may be obligated under the rules and regulations of the SEC to
prepare, and cause to be audited or reviewed, financial statements with
respect to the Acquired Companies. Seller agrees (and such agreement will
survive the Closing for a period of one year) to furnish Buyer with financial
and other information and reasonable access during normal business hours and
without disruption to Sellers business to appropriate employees of Seller as
may be reasonably requested by Buyer (including in connection with Buyers
preparation of pro forma financial statements) so that Buyer may prepare such
financial statements, comply with its disclosure obligations and obtain audit
opinions, and review reports required with respect to the Acquired Companies.
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyer may not use the results of its review
under this _Section 5.16_ to pursue any claim against Seller under the terms
of this Agreement.

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

7.1  _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained herein and in
any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall survive the Closing and shall
remain in full force and effect until the date that is 18 months from the
Closing Date;  _provided_ , _however_ , (a) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Sections 3.1_, _3.2_ and _4.1_ (Organization and
Authority), _Section 3.4_ (Capitalization) and Sections _3.14_ and  _4.4_
(Financial Advisors) (collectively, the " _Fundamental Representations_ "),
and any representation in the case of fraud, shall survive indefinitely; and
(b) the representations and warranties set forth in  _Section 3.13_ (Taxes)
shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations with respect to the Tax liabilities in question. The respective
covenants and agreements of Seller and Buyer contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until the expiration of the statute of limitations
following the date all performance thereunder was due to be performed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any claims asserted in good faith with
reasonable specificity (to the extent known at such time) and in writing by
notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party prior to the
expiration date of the survival period shall not thereafter be barred by the
expiration of such survival period and such claims shall survive until
finally resolved.

7.2 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the other terms and conditions
of this _Article 7_ , Seller shall indemnify Buyer against, and shall hold
Buyer harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by,
or imposed upon, Buyer based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by
reason of:

 

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Seller contained in this Agreement in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto;

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation to
be performed by Seller under this Agreement; or

(c) any indebtedness (which does not include capitalized lease agreements) or
transaction expenses related to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby charged to the Acquired Companies or any of their
Affiliates.

7.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the other terms and conditions of
this _Article 7_ , Buyer shall indemnify Seller against, and shall hold Seller
harmless from and against, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or
imposed upon, Seller based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason
of:

(a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties of
Buyer contained in this Agreement in any certificate delivered pursuant
hereto;

(b) any breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant, agreement or obligation
to be performed by Buyer under this Agreement; or

 



33 (c) any claims made on the Reclamation Bonds.

 

7.4 _Certain Limitations_. The party making a claim under this _Article 7_ or
_Section 8.2_ is referred to as the " _Indemnified Party_ " and the party
against whom such claims are asserted under this _Article 7_ or _Section 8.2_
is referred to as the " _Indemnifying Party_ ". The indemnification provided
for in  _Section 7.2_, _Section 7.3_ and _Section 8.2_ shall be subject to
the following limitations:

(a) (i) Seller shall not be liable for indemnification under _Section
7.2(a)_ (A) unless the amount of Losses with respect to any claim, or series
of related claims arising from the same matter, fact or circumstance in the
aggregate, exceeds $50,000 (any claim involving Losses equal to or less than
such amount is referred to as a " _De Minimis Claim_ ") and (B) until the
aggregate amount of all Losses (including De Minimis Claims) in respect of
indemnification under  _Section 7.2(a)_ exceeds $1,000,000 (the "
_Deductible_ "), in which event Seller shall only be required to pay or be
liable for Losses in excess of the Deductible, and (ii) the aggregate amount
of all Losses for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_
shall not exceed $15,000,000; _provided_ , that the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii) shall not apply to Losses arising out of or relating to the inaccuracy or
breach of any Fundamental Representation or _Section 3.13_ (Taxes) or to any
representation or warranty in the event of fraud. The aggregate amount of all
Losses for which Seller shall be liable pursuant to _Section 7.2_ and 
_Section 8.2_ or Buyer shall be liable for pursuant to _Section 7.3_ shall
not exceed $105,000,000.

(b) Payments by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss shall be limited
to the amount of any liability or damage that remains after deducting
therefrom any insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other
similar payment actually received by the Indemnified Party (or the Acquired
Companies) in respect of any such claim.

(c) Payments by an Indemnifying Party in respect of any Loss shall be reduced
by an amount equal to any Tax benefit actually realized as a reduction in cash
liability for Tax for the taxable year in which the Loss is incurred.

 

(d) In determining whether there has been a breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant, and, if applicable, the amount of any Losses in respect
of such breach, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard or
qualification contained in such representation or warranty shall be
disregarded.

 

(e) If (i) (A) Seller gives Buyer written notice that (1) Seller will not
deliver the certificate required pursuant to Section 6.2(c) because of an
inaccuracy or breach of a representation or warranty, (2) describes such
inaccuracy or breach with reasonable specificity and (3) provides an
acknowledgement that such failure to deliver the certificate required
pursuant to Section 6.2(c) permits Buyer to terminate this Agreement without
liability to Seller under this Agreement or for any other reason, and (B)
notwithstanding such notice, Buyer proceeds to close the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and conditions
provided in this Agreement, then (ii) Buyer shall be deemed to have waived any
rights to indemnity or otherwise for an inaccuracy or breach described in such
notice it may have otherwise had based on the inaccuracy or breach of the
representation or warranty described in such notice.

 



34 7.5 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. If any Indemnified Party receives notice of the
assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal
proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement
or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the
foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party
with respect to which the Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the
Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such
prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party forfeits material rights or defenses by reason of such
failure. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Third-Party
Claim in reasonable detail, shall include copies of all material written
evidence thereof and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably
practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified
Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any
Third-Party Claim at the Indemnifying Partys expense and by the Indemnifying
Partys own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim for equitable
or injunctive relief or any claim that would impose criminal liability or
damages, and the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, any such Third Party Claim. In the event
that the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of any Third-Party Claim,
subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, it shall have the right to take such action as
it deems necessary to avoid, dispute, defend, appeal or make counterclaims
pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its own cost
and expense, to participate in the defense of any Third-Party Claim with
counsel selected by it subject to the Indemnifying Partys right to
control the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall
be at the expense of the Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, (i) there are legal
defenses available to an Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party; or (ii) there exists
a conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim,
fails to promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to
defend as provided in this Agreement or fails to diligently prosecute the
defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may, subject to
_Section 7.5(b)_, pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third-Party Claim. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate with each
other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any Third-
Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.7_) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may
be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.

 



35 (b) _Settlement of Third-Party Claims_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any
Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
provided in this  _Section 7.5(b)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial
or other obligation, involving a finding of admission of wrongdoing, or
imposing equitable remedies on the part of the Indemnified Party and
provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified
Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party
Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer,
the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the
Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm
offer within ten days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party
may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event,
the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim
shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party
fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim
upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim.
If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section
7.5(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of
the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) _Direct Claims_. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss
which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall
be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt
written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall
not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification
obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party
forfeits material rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by
the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail,
shall include copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall
indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
shall have 30 days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. During such 30-day period, the Indemnified Party shall
allow the Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the
matter or circumstance alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether
and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and
the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys investigation by
giving such information and assistance (including access to the Acquired
Companies premises and personnel and the right to examine and copy any
accounts, documents or records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be
deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified Party shall
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnified Party
on the terms and subject to the provisions of this Agreement.

7.6 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. All indemnification payments
made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to
the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

7.7  _Exclusive Remedies_. Subject to _Section 10.11_, the parties
acknowledge and agree that their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any
and all claims (other than claims arising from fraud on the part of a party
hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement)
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or
obligation

 



36  set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this
Agreement shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in
this _Article 7_ and _Section 8.2_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each
party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Law, any and all
rights, claims and causes of action (other than claims arising from fraud on
the part of a party hereto in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement) for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject
matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and
their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or
based upon any Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set
forth in this _Article 7_ and _Section 8.2_. Nothing in this  _Section 7.7_
shall limit any Persons right to seek and obtain any equitable relief to
which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to _Section 10.11_.

 

ARTICLE 8

_TAX MATTERS_

 

8.1 _Tax-Sharing Agreements_. Any tax-sharing agreement between Seller and the
Acquired Companies shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and shall have
no further effect for any taxable year (whether the current year, a future
year, or a past year), and none of the Acquired Companies shall have any
obligations thereunder following the Closing.

 

8.2 _Taxes Attributable to Pre-Closing Period and Other Taxes_. Seller shall
be responsible and shall indemnify Buyer for all Taxes of the Acquired
Companies for all taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the
portion through the end of the Closing Date for any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date as set forth in  _Section
8.4(e)_. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall indemnify and hold Seller
and their Affiliates harmless against all Taxes of the Acquired Companies for
all taxable periods beginning after the Closing Date and the
portion beginning on the day after the Closing Date for any taxable period
that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date as set forth in _Section
8.4(e)_.

 

8.3 _Tax Refunds and Tax Benefits_. Any Tax refund, credit in lieu of a Tax
refund, or similar benefit (including any interest paid or credited with
respect thereto) relating to taxable periods (or portions of taxable period)
ending on or before the Closing Date shall be the property of Seller and, if
received by Buyer, its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies, shall be paid
over promptly to Seller (net of any expenses of Buyer incurred in claiming or
receiving such Tax refund) . Buyer shall, if Seller so reasonably requests and
at Sellers expense, cause the Acquired Companies or other relevant entity to
file for and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and expedite the
receipt of any refund to which Seller is entitled under this _Section 8.3_.
Buyer shall permit Seller to participate in (at Sellers expense) the
prosecution of any such refund claim.

8.4 _Contests_.

 

(a) After the Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing of the
proposed assessment or the commencement of any Tax audit or administrative or
judicial proceeding or of any demand or claim on Buyer, its Affiliates or the
Acquired Companies which, if determined adversely to the taxpayer or after the
lapse of time, could be grounds for indemnification by Seller. Such
notice shall contain factual information (to the extent known to

 



37  Buyer, its Affiliates or the Acquired Companies) describing the asserted Tax
liability in reasonable detail and shall include copies of any notice or other
document received from any taxing authority in respect of any such asserted
Tax liability. If Buyer fails to give Seller prompt notice of an asserted Tax
liability as required by this _Section 8.4_, then Seller shall not have any
obligation to indemnify for any loss arising out of such asserted Tax
liability, but only to the extent that failure to give such notice results in
a material detriment to Seller.

 

(b) In the case of a Tax audit or administrative or judicial proceeding (a "
_Contest_ ") that relates to taxable periods ending on or before the Closing
Date, Seller shall have the sole right, at its expense, to control the conduct
of such Contest, provided, however, that Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably
informed with respect to such Contest and that Buyer may (at its
sole expense) participate in the defense of such Contest. Seller shall not
settle or otherwise agree to the resolution of any such Contest without the
prior written consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

(c) Buyer shall direct and control, through counsel of its own choosing, any
Contest with respect to a taxable period that begins prior to the Closing
Date and ends after the Closing (a " _Straddle Period_ "), and Seller shall
cooperate in each phase of such Contest. None of Buyer or any Acquired Company
may settle or compromise any asserted liability for which Seller would have
an indemnification obligation pursuant to this Article 8 without prior written
consent of Seller; provided, however, that consent to settlement or compromise
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed. In any event,
Seller may participate, at its own expense, in such Contest to the extent it
could result in an indemnification obligation of Seller pursuant to this
Article 8.

 

(d) Buyer and Seller agree to cooperate, and Buyer agrees to cause the
Acquired Companies to cooperate, in the defense against or compromise of any
claim in any Contest.

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes allocable to the portion of a
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be (i) in the case of any
Taxes other than income Taxes, South Dakota Mineral Severance Tax and Taxes
based on receipts or sales or that are otherwise transactionally based, deemed
to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
prior to and ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any
income Taxes, South Dakota Mineral Severance Tax and Taxes based on receipts
or sale or that are otherwise transactionally based, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Straddle Period ended on the
Closing Date, provided that all permitted allowances, credits, exemptions and
deductions that are normally computed on the basis of an entire year period
(such as depreciation and amortization deductions) shall accrue on a daily
basis and shall be allocated between the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle
Period and the post-Closing portion of the Straddle Period in proportion to
the number of days in each such period; provided, however, that any credits
relating to a Straddle Period shall be taken into account as though the
relevant taxable period ended on the Closing Date and provided that all
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with prior practices of the Acquired
Companies, except where such practice is not consistent with applicable legal
requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any penalty, interest or addition
to Tax shall be allocated to the party that bears the liability for the Tax to
which such penalty, interest or addition to Tax relates, regardless of when
such penalty, interest or addition to Tax is assessed.

 



38 8.5 _Returns_.

 

(a) The common parent of Seller and the Acquired Companies shall prepare and
file (or cause Seller or the Acquired Companies to prepare and file) all Tax
Returns relating to the Acquired Companies for any taxable period ending on or
before the Closing and shall pay any Tax shown as due thereon. The common
parent of Seller and the Acquired Companies shall include the income of
the Acquired Companies on its consolidated federal income Tax Returns for all
periods through the end of the Closing Date and pay any federal income Taxes
attributable to such income. The Acquired Companies shall furnish Tax
information to Seller for inclusion in Sellers federal consolidated income
Tax Return for the period that includes the Closing Date in accordance with
the Acquired Companies past custom and practice. The income of the Acquired
Companies shall be apportioned to the period up to and including the Closing
Date and the period after the Closing Date by closing the books of the
Acquired Companies as of the end of the Closing Date. Seller shall provide
Buyer with a copy of any such completed Tax Return (other than a consolidated
income tax return of the common parent of Seller) at least 10 days prior to
the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax Return.

 

(b) Buyer shall prepare and file (or cause the Acquired Companies to prepare
and file) all Tax Returns that relate to the Acquired Companies for taxable
periods ending after the Closing Date (including Straddle Periods); it being
understood that all Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Returns shall
be the responsibility of Buyer (including any Taxes included in the Closing
Net Working Capital), except for Taxes that are attributable to the pre-
Closing period. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with
those prepared for prior taxable periods unless a different treatment of any
item is required by applicable Law. With respect to any Tax Return required
to be filed with respect to the Acquired Companies after the Closing Date and
as to which Taxes are allocable to Seller, Buyer shall provide Seller and its
authorized Representative with a copy of such completed Tax Return and a
statement (with which Buyer will make available such information as is
reasonably necessary to support such statement) certifying the amount of Tax
shown on such Tax Return that is allocable to Seller at least 30 days prior
to the due date (including any extension thereof) for filing of such Tax
Return, and Seller and its authorized Representative shall have the right to
review and comment on such Tax Return and statement prior to the filing of
such Tax Return. Seller and Buyer agree to consult and to attempt in good
faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of the review of such Tax
Return and statement by Seller or its authorized representative.

 

8.6 _Tax Cooperation and Exchange of Information_. Seller and Buyer shall
provide each other with such cooperation and information as either of them
reasonably may request of the other (and Buyer shall cause the Acquired
Companies to provide such cooperation and information) in filing any Tax
Return, amended Tax Return or claim for refund, determining a liability for
Taxes or a right to a refund of Taxes or participating in or conducting any
audit or other proceeding in respect of Taxes. Such cooperation and
information shall include providing copies of relevant Tax Returns or portions
thereof, together with related work papers and documents relating to rulings
or other determinations by the applicable Governmental

 



39  Authorities. Seller and Buyer shall make themselves (and their respective
employees) reasonably available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanations of any documents or information provided under this _Section
8.6_. Each of Seller and Buyer shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and
work papers and all material records or other documents in its possession (or
in the possession of its Affiliates) relating to Tax matters of the Acquired
Companies for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date and for all
prior taxable periods until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of
limitations of the taxable periods to which such Tax Returns and other
documents relate, without regard to extensions or (ii) six years following the
due date (without extension) for such Tax Returns. After such time, before
Seller or Buyer shall dispose of any such documents in its possession (or in
the possession of its Affiliates), the other party shall be given an
opportunity, after 90 days prior written notice, to remove and retain all or
any part of such documents as such other party may select (at such other
partys expense). Any information obtained under this _Section 8.6_ shall be
kept confidential, except as may be otherwise necessary in connection with the
filing of Tax Returns or claims for refund or in conducting an audit or other
proceeding.

 

8.7 _Section 338(h)(10) Election_. In connection with the sale of the Shares
contemplated hereby, the parties shall cause an election pursuant to Section
338(h)(10) of the Code to be made for the Company, and for each Subsidiary of
the Company that is eligible to make such election, for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes, and shall cause similar elections to be made under analogous
provisions of applicable state and local Law, and shall comply with the rules
and regulations applicable to such elections. For purposes of making such
elections, Buyer shall determine the value of the tangible and intangible
assets of the Acquired Companies and shall within 120 days provide Seller
with an allocation of the Buyers "adjusted grossed-up basis" in the Shares
(within the meaning of the Regulations under Section 338 of the Code) among
such assets (the " _Allocation_ "). Seller shall have the right to make
comments on the Allocation, which comments shall be accepted by Buyer. The
Allocation shall be binding upon Seller and Buyer for purposes of allocating
the "aggregate deemed selling price" (within the meaning of the Regulations)
among the assets of the Acquired Companies, and neither party shall file any
Tax Return, or take a position with a Tax authority, that is inconsistent with
the Allocation. Each party agrees to cooperate with the other in the
preparation of IRS Form 8883 or any similar form required by a state taxing
authority in connection with a Section 338(h)(10) election and to furnish the
other party with a copy of such form or forms prepared in draft form within a
reasonable period before its filing due date.

8.8 _Indemnification for Post-Closing Transactions_. Buyer agrees to
indemnify Seller for any additional tax owed by Seller (including tax owed by
Seller due to this indemnification payment) resulting from any transaction
engaged in by the Acquired Companies not in the ordinary course of business
occurring on or after the Closing Date after Buyers purchase of the Shares,
other than transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the elections described in _Section 8.7_).

 



40 8.9 Tax _Covenants_. Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall amend,
refile or otherwise modify, or cause or permit the Acquired Companies to
amend, refile or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return with respect
to any taxable period (or portion of any taxable period), ending on or before
the Closing Date without the prior written consent of Seller, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

8.10 _Tax Indemnification_. In the event of any conflict between the
provisions of _Article 7_ and this _Article 8_ , the provisions of Article 8
shall control with respect to Taxes, provided, however, that _Section 8.2_
shall be subject to Section 7.4 to the extent provided therein.

ARTICLE 9

complied with by it prior to the Closing;

 

(c) by Seller by written notice to Buyer if:

 

(i) Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this Agreement

to the Closing; or

 



41 (d) by Buyer or Seller in the event that:

 

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions

illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability shall not affect any other term or provision of this
Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any

is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in
good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated
to the greatest extent possible.

 



43 10.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Disclosure Letter and the

court), and each party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of
such courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Service of process,
summons, notice or other document by mail to such partys address set forth

proceeding brought in any such court. The parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit,
action or any proceeding in such courts and irrevocably waive and agree not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.

 



44 10.11 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with the terms hereof and that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives
(a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law
would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
