          Stock at the Stock Exchange Ratio (such election, the "All Stock
          Election"), provided that:

                     (A)  Fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable
               by check) will be paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section
               3.03; and

                     (B)  Giving effect to Section 3.01(a)(i), (ii), and (iii),
               in no event shall, in the aggregate, more than seventy-five

               Common Stock; or

               (ii)  AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, all of such holder's Three
          Rivers Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be
          converted into and become cash (payable by check) at the Cash Exchange
          Ratio (such election, the "All Cash Election"), provided that:

                     (A)  Giving effect to Section 3.01(a)(i), (ii), and (iii),
               in no event shall, in the aggregate, more than twenty-five
               percent (25%) of such Three Rivers Common Stock issued and
               outstanding on the Effective Date be converted into and become
               cash; or

               (iii) AT THE OPTION OF THE HOLDER, seventy-five percent (75%) of
          such holder's aggregate number of shares of Three Rivers Common Stock
          shall be converted into and become shares of Sky Common Stock at the
          rate of the Stock Exchange Ratio and twenty-five percent (25%) of such
          holder's aggregate number of shares of Three Rivers Common Stock
          deposited with the Exchange Agent shall be converted into and become

<PAGE>

          the rate of the Cash Exchange Ratio (such election, the "Mixed
          Election"), provided that:

                     (A)  Fractional shares will not be issued and cash (payable
               by check) will be paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section
               3.03; and

                     (B)  Giving effect to Section 3.01(a)(i), (ii), and (iii),
               in no event shall, in the aggregate, more than seventy-five
               percent (75%) of such Three Rivers Common Stock issued and

               (iv)  IF NO ELECTION (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3.01(d)) IS MADE BY
          THE HOLDER BY THE ELECTION DEADLINE (AS DEFINED IN SECTION 3.01(d)),
          all of such holder's shares of Three Rivers Common Stock shall be
          converted into the right to receive Sky Common Stock as set forth in
          Section 3.01(a)(i), cash as set forth in Section 3.01(a)(ii), or any
          combination of Sky Common Stock and cash as determined by Sky, at the
          Stock Exchange Ratio and the Cash Exchange Ratio, as applicable;
          provided, however, that fractional shares shall not be issued and cash
          will be paid in lieu thereof as provided in Section 3.03. Such shares
          of Three Rivers Common Stock shall be allocated by Sky pro rata among
          non-electing holders based upon the number of shares of Three Rivers
          Common Stock for which an election has not been received by the
          Election Deadline in order to achieve the overall ratio of
          seventy-five percent (75%) of Three Rivers Common Stock to be
          converted into Sky Common Stock and twenty-five percent (25%) of Three
          Rivers Common Stock to be converted into cash. Notice of such
          allocation shall be provided promptly to each stockholder whose shares
          of Three Rivers Common Stock are allocated pursuant to this Section
          3.01(a)(iv).

          (b)  Treasury Shares and Shares Held by Sky. Each share of Three
     Rivers Common Stock held as Treasury Stock or held by Sky immediately prior
     to the Effective Time shall be canceled and retired at the Effective Time
     and no consideration shall be issued in exchange therefor.

          (c)  Outstanding Sky Common Stock. Each share of Sky Common Stock
     issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
     issued and outstanding and unaffected by the Merger.

          (d)  Procedures for Election. An election form and other appropriate
     transmittal materials in such form as Three Rivers and Sky shall mutually
     agree (the "Election Form") shall be mailed to stockholders of Three Rivers
     prior to the Election Period (defined below). The "Election Period" shall
     be such period of time as Three

                                        9

<PAGE>

          Rivers and Sky shall mutually agree, within which Three Rivers
          stockholders may validly elect the form of Merger Consideration set
          forth in Section 3.01(a) (the "Election") that they will receive,
          occurring between (i) the date of the mailing by Three Rivers of the
          Proxy Statement for the special meeting of stockholders of Three
          Rivers at which this Agreement is presented for approval and (ii) the
          Effective Date. The "Election Deadline" shall be the time, specified
          by Sky after consultation with Three Rivers, on the last day of the
          Election Period.

               (e)  Perfection of the Election. An Election shall be considered
          to have been validly made by a Three Rivers stockholder only if (i)
          the Exchange Agent (as defined in Section 3.04) shall have received an
          Election Form properly completed and executed by such stockholder,
          accompanied by a certificate or certificates representing the shares
          of Three Rivers Common Stock as to which such Election is being made,
          duly endorsed in blank or otherwise in form acceptable for transfer on
          the books of Three Rivers, or containing an appropriate guaranty of
          delivery in the form customarily used in transactions of this nature
          from a member of a national securities exchange or a member of the
          NASD or a commercial bank or trust company in the United States and
          (ii) such Election Form and such certificate(s) or such guaranty of
          delivery shall have been received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
          Election Deadline.

               (f)  Withdrawal of Shares. Any Three Rivers stockholder may at
          any time prior to the Election Deadline revoke its election and either
          (i) submit a new Election Form in accordance with the procedures in
          Section 3.01(e), or (ii) withdraw the certificate(s) for Three Rivers
          Common Stock deposited therewith by providing written notice that is
          received by the Exchange Agent by 5:00 p.m., local time for the
          Exchange Agent, on the business day prior to the Election Deadline.
          Elections may be similarly revoked if the Effective Date does not
          occur by January 31, 2003. In the event of the termination of this
          Agreement, the Exchange Agent shall return any certificates deposited
          by the holder of Three Rivers Common Stock to such holder at the
          address and to the person set forth in the Election Form.

               (g)  Reduction of Shares Deposited for Cash. If more than
          twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of shares of Three
          Rivers Common Stock issued and outstanding have, at the Election
          Deadline, been deposited for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election or
          the Mixed Election and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.01(f), Sky
          will promptly eliminate, or cause to be eliminated by the Exchange
          Agent, from the shares deposited pursuant to the All Cash Election
          (subject to the limitations described in Section 3.01(g)(iv)), a
          sufficient number of such shares so that the total number of shares
          remaining on deposit for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election and
          the Mixed Election does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the
          shares of Three Rivers Common Stock issued and outstanding on the
          Effective Date. The holders of Three Rivers Common Stock who have
          elected to have their shares converted pursuant to the Mixed Election
          shall not be required to have more than seventy-five percent (75%) of
          their shares of Three Rivers Common Stock converted into Sky Common
          Stock. After giving effect to Section 3.01(a)(iv), such elimination
          will be effected as follows:

                    (i)  Subject to the limitations described in Section
               3.01(g)(iv), Sky

                                       10

<PAGE>

               will eliminate or cause to be eliminated from the shares
               deposited pursuant to the All Cash Election, and will add or
               cause to be added to the shares deposited for Sky Common Stock
               pursuant to the All Stock Election, on a pro rata basis in
               relation to the total number of shares deposited pursuant to the
               All Cash Election minus the number of shares so deposited by the
               holders described in Section 3.01(g)(iv)(A) and the number of
               shares so deposited by the administrators of Three Rivers'
               defined benefit pension plan and 401(k) plan, such number of
               whole shares of Three Rivers Common Stock on deposit for cash
               pursuant to the All Cash Election as may be necessary so that the
               total number of shares remaining on deposit for cash pursuant to
               All Cash Election or the Mixed Election is equal, as nearly as
               practicable, to twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of Three
               Rivers Common Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date;

                    (ii)   All shares of Three Rivers Common Stock that are
               eliminated pursuant to Section 3.01(g)(i) from the shares
               deposited for cash shall be converted into Sky Common Stock as
               provided by Section 3.01(a)(i);

                    (iii)  Notice of such allocation shall be provided promptly
               to each stockholder whose shares of Three Rivers Common Stock are
               eliminated from the shares on deposit for cash pursuant to
               Section 3.01(g)(i); and

                    (iv)   Notwithstanding the foregoing:

                           (A)  the holders of one hundred (100) or fewer shares
               of Three Rivers Common Stock of record on the date of this
               Agreement who have elected the All Cash Election shall not be
               required to have any of their shares of Three Rivers Common Stock
               converted into Sky Common Stock;

                           (B)  the administrators of the Three Rivers' defined
               benefit pension plan and 401(k) plan shall not be required to
               have any of the shares of Three Rivers Common Stock held in such
               plans converted into Sky Common Stock if the appropriate
               administrator has elected the All Cash Election, and shall not be
               required to have more than seventy-five percent (75%) of the
               shares of Three Rivers Common Stock held in such plans converted
               into Sky Common Stock if the appropriate administrator has
               elected the Mixed Election.

               (h)  Increase of Shares Deposited for Cash. If fewer than
          twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of shares of Three
          Rivers Common Stock issued and outstanding have, at the Election
          Deadline, been deposited for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election or
          the Mixed Election and not withdrawn pursuant to Section 3.01(f), Sky
          will promptly add, or cause to be added by the Exchange Agent, to such
          deposited shares, a sufficient number of shares of Three Rivers Common
          Stock deposited for shares of Sky Common Stock pursuant to the All
          Stock Election (subject to the limitation described in Section
          3.01(h)(iv)) so that the total number of shares of Three Rivers Common
          Stock on deposit for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election or the
          Mixed Election on the Effective Date is not less than twenty-five
          percent (25%) of the shares of Three Rivers Common

                                       11

<PAGE>

     Stock issued and outstanding on the Effective Date. The holders of Three
     Rivers Common Stock who have elected to have their shares converted
     pursuant to the Mixed Election shall not be required to have more than
     twenty-five percent (25%) of their shares of Three Rivers Common Stock
     converted into cash. After giving effect to Section 3.01(a)(iv), such
     addition will be effected as follows:

               (i)    Subject to the limitation described in Section
           3.01(h)(iv), Sky will add or cause to be added to the shares
           deposited for cash pursuant to the All Cash Election or the Mixed
           Election, and will eliminate or cause to be eliminated from the
           shares deposited for Sky Common Stock pursuant to the All Stock
           Election, on a pro rata basis in relation to the total number of
           shares of Three Rivers Common Stock deposited for shares of Sky
           Common Stock pursuant to the All Stock Election minus the number of
           shares so deposited by the administrators of Three Rivers' defined
           benefit pension plan and 401(k) plan, such number of whole shares of
           Three Rivers Common Stock not then on deposit for cash as may be
           necessary so that the number of shares remaining on deposit for cash
           is equal, as nearly as practicable, to twenty-five percent (25%) of
           the shares of Three Rivers Common Stock issued and outstanding on the
           Effective Date;

               (ii)   All shares of Three Rivers Common Stock that are added
           pursuant to Section 3.01(h)(i) to the shares deposited for cash shall
           be converted into cash as provided by Section 3.01(a)(ii);

               (iii)  Notice of such allocation shall be provided promptly to
           each stockholder whose shares of Three Rivers Common Stock are added
           to the shares on deposit for cash pursuant to Section 3.01(h)(i); and

               (iv)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrators of the
           Three Rivers' defined benefit pension plan and 401(k) plan shall not
           be required to have any of the shares of Three Rivers Common Stock
           held in such plans converted into cash if the appropriate
           administrator has elected the All Stock Election, and shall not be
           required to have more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the shares of
           Three Rivers Common Stock held in such plans converted into cash if
           the administrator has elected the Mixed Election.

     3.02  Rights as Stockholders; Stock Transfers. At the Effective Time,
holders of Three Rivers Common Stock shall cease to be, and shall have no rights
as, stockholders of Three Rivers, other than to receive any dividend or other
distribution with respect to such Three Rivers Common Stock with a record date
occurring prior to the Effective Time and the consideration provided under this
Article III. After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of Three Rivers or the Surviving Corporation of any shares of
Three Rivers Stock.

     3.03  Fractional Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, no
fractional shares of Sky Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor, or
other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the Merger; instead, Sky
shall pay to each holder of Three Rivers Common Stock who would otherwise be
entitled to a fractional share of Sky Common Stock (after taking into account
all Old Certificates delivered by such holder) an amount in cash

                                       12

<PAGE>

(without interest) determined by multiplying such fractional share of Sky Common
Stock to which the holder would be entitled by the last sale price of Sky Common
Stock (as reported by the NASDAQ, as reported in The Wall Street Journal or, if
not reported therein, in another authoritative source) for the average of 20
NASDAQ trading days immediately preceding the Effective Date.

     3.04  Exchange Procedures. (a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Sky shall
deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with The Bank of New York (in such
capacity, the "Exchange Agent"), for the benefit of the holders of certificates
formerly representing shares of Three Rivers Common Stock ("Old Certificates"),
for exchange in accordance with this Article III, certificates representing the
shares of Sky Common Stock ("New Certificates") and an estimated amount of cash
(such cash and New Certificates, together with any dividends or distributions
with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date with respect thereto
(without any interest on any such cash, dividends or distributions), being
hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund") to be paid pursuant to this
Article III in exchange for outstanding shares of Three Rivers Common Stock.

     (b)   As promptly as practicable after the Effective Date, Sky shall cause
the New Certificates into which shares of a stockholder's Three Rivers Common
Stock are converted on the Effective Date and/or any check in respect of cash to
be paid as part of the Merger Consideration and in respect of any fractional
share interests or dividends or distributions which such person shall be
entitled to receive to be delivered to such stockholder upon delivery to the
Exchange Agent of Old Certificates representing such shares of Three Rivers
Common Stock (or an indemnity affidavit reasonably satisfactory to Sky and the
Exchange Agent, if any of such certificates are lost, stolen or destroyed) owned
by such stockholder. No interest will be paid on any such cash to be paid in
lieu of fractional share interests or in respect of dividends or distributions
which any such person shall be entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III
upon such delivery.

     (c)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent, if any,
nor any party hereto shall be liable to any former holder of Three Rivers Common
Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

     (d)   No dividends or other distributions with respect to Sky Common Stock
with a record date occurring on or after the Effective Date shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate representing shares of Three Rivers
Common Stock converted in the Merger into the right to receive shares of such
Sky Common Stock until the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive New
Certificates in exchange therefor in accordance with the procedures set forth in
this Section 3.04. After becoming so entitled in accordance with this Section
3.04, the record holder thereof also shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofor
had become payable with respect to shares of Sky Common Stock such holder had
the right to receive upon surrender of the Old Certificates.

     (e)   Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of Three Rivers for nine months after the Effective Time shall be
paid to Sky. Any stockholders of

                                       13

<PAGE>

Three Rivers who have not theretofor complied with this Article III shall
thereafter look only to Sky for payment of the shares of Sky Common Stock, cash
in lieu of any fractional shares and unpaid dividends and distributions on Sky
Common Stock deliverable in respect of each share of Three Rivers Common Stock
such stockholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest thereon.

     3.05  Anti-Dilution Provisions. In the event Sky changes (or establishes a
record date for changing) the number of shares of Sky Common Stock issued and
outstanding between the date hereof and the Effective Date as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, split up,
combination, exchange of shares, readjustment or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Sky Common Stock and the record date therefor shall
be prior to the Effective Date, the Stock Exchange Ratio and the Cash Exchange
Ratio shall be proportionately adjusted.

     3.06  Options. On the Effective Date, each outstanding option to purchase
shares of Three Rivers Common Stock under the Three Rivers Stock Plans (each, a
"Three Rivers Stock Option"), shall be terminated in exchange for a cash payment
by Sky to each holder of a Three Rivers Stock Option in an amount equal to the
Cash Exchange Ratio minus the applicable exercise price per share for Three
Rivers Common Stock covered by any such Three Rivers Stock Option, multiplied by
the number of shares of Three Rivers Common Stock covered by such Three Rivers
Stock Option. At or prior to the Effective Time, Three Rivers shall use its best
efforts, including using its best efforts to obtain any necessary consents from
optionees, with respect to the Three Rivers Stock Plans to permit the
termination of the outstanding Three Rivers Stock Options by Sky pursuant to
this Section 3.06.

                                   ARTICLE IV

     5.01  Disclosure Schedules. On or prior to the date hereof, Sky has
delivered to Three Rivers a schedule and Three Rivers has delivered to Sky a
schedule (respectively, its "Disclosure Schedule") setting forth, among other
things, items, the disclosure of which are necessary or appropriate either in
response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof or
as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Section 5.03 or 5.04 or to one or more of its respective covenants contained in
Article IV and Article VI; provided, however, that (a) no such item is required
to be set forth in a Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or
warranty if its absence would not be reasonably likely to result in the related
representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect under the standard
established by Section 5.02, and (b) the mere inclusion of an item in a
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be
deemed an admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or
fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to have or
result in a Material Adverse Effect on the party making the

                                       17

<PAGE>

representation. Three Rivers' representations, warranties and covenants
contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be untrue, incorrect or to
have been breached as a result of effects on Three Rivers arising solely from
actions taken in compliance with a written request of Sky.

     5.02  Standard. No representation or warranty of Three Rivers or Sky
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 shall be deemed untrue or incorrect, and no
party hereto shall be deemed to have breached a representation or warranty, as a
consequence of the existence of any fact, event or circumstance unless such
fact, circumstance or event, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events or circumstances inconsistent with any representation or warranty
contained in Section 5.03 or 5.04 has had, or is reasonably likely to have, a
Material Adverse Effect.

     5.03  Representations and Warranties of Three Rivers. Subject to Sections
5.01 and 5.02 and except as Previously Disclosed in a paragraph of its
Disclosure Schedule corresponding to the relevant paragraph below, Three Rivers
hereby represents and warrants to Sky:

           (a)  Organization, Standing and Authority. Three Rivers is a
     corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
     laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and any foreign jurisdictions
     where its ownership or leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its
     business requires it to be so qualified. Three Rivers is registered as a
     bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as
     amended. Bank is a Pennsylvania state bank chartered under the Pennsylvania
     Banking Code of 1965, as amended, and is duly organized, validly existing
     and in good standing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
     Three Rivers is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing in
     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and any foreign jurisdictions where its
     ownership or leasing of property or assets or the conduct of its business
     requires it to be so qualified.

           (b)  Capital Structure of Three Rivers. The authorized capital stock
     of Three Rivers consists solely of 25,000,000 shares, of which (A)

     5,000,000 shares are Three Rivers Preferred Stock, without par value, of
     which no shares were outstanding as of May 3, 2002. The outstanding shares
     of Three Rivers Common Stock have been duly authorized, are validly issued
     and outstanding, fully paid and nonassessable, and are not subject to any
     preemptive rights (and were not issued in violation of any preemptive
     rights). As of May 3, 2002, (i) there were no shares of Three Rivers Common
     Stock authorized and reserved for issuance, (ii) Three Rivers did not have
     any Rights issued or outstanding with respect to Three Rivers Common Stock,
     and (iii) Three Rivers did not have any commitment to authorize, issue or
     sell any Three Rivers Common Stock or Rights, except pursuant to this
     Agreement. The number of shares of Three Rivers Common Stock which were
     issuable and reserved for issuance upon exercise of Three Rivers Stock
     Options as of April 30, 2002 was Previously Disclosed in Three Rivers'
     Disclosure Schedule.

           (c)  Subsidiaries.

          its Subsidiaries together with the jurisdiction of organization of
          each such Subsidiary, (B) it owns, directly or indirectly, all the
          issued and outstanding equity securities of each of its Subsidiaries,
          (C) no equity securities of any of its Subsidiaries are or may become
          required to be issued (other than to it or its wholly-owned
          Subsidiaries) by reason of any Right or otherwise, (D) there are no
          contracts, commitments, understandings or arrangements by which any of
          such Subsidiaries is or may be bound to sell or otherwise transfer any
          equity securities of any such Subsidiaries (other than to it or its
          wholly-owned Subsidiaries), (E) there are no contracts, commitments,
          understandings, or arrangements relating to its rights to vote or to
          dispose of such securities and (F) all the equity securities of each
          Subsidiary held by Three Rivers or its Subsidiaries are fully paid and
          nonassessable (except pursuant to 12 U.S.C. Section 55) and are owned
          by Three Rivers or its Subsidiaries free and clear of any Liens.

               (ii)   Three Rivers does not own beneficially, directly or
          indirectly, any equity securities or similar interests of any Person,
          or any interest in a partnership or joint venture of any kind, other
          than its Subsidiaries.

               (iii)  Each of Three Rivers' Subsidiaries has been duly organized
          and is validly existing in good standing under the laws of the
          jurisdiction of its organization, and is duly qualified to do business
          and in good standing in the jurisdictions where its ownership or
          leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it to be
          so qualified.

          (d)  Corporate Power; Authorized and Effective Agreement. Each of
     Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries has full corporate power and authority to
     carry on its business as it is now being conducted and to own all its
     properties and assets. Three Rivers has the corporate power and authority
     to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement. Bank
     has the corporate power and authority to consummate the Subsidiary Merger
     and the Agreement to Merge in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

          (e)  Corporate Authority. Subject to receipt of the requisite adoption
     of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
     Three Rivers Common Stock entitled to vote thereon (which is the only
     stockholder vote required thereon), this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby have been authorized by all necessary corporate action
     of Three Rivers and the Three Rivers Board prior to the date hereof. The
     Agreement to Merge, when executed by Bank, shall have been approved by the
     Board of Directors of Bank and by the Three Rivers Board, as the sole
     stockholder of Bank. This Agreement is a valid and legally binding
     obligation of Three Rivers, enforceable in accordance with its terms
     (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and similar
     laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights or
     by general equity principles). The Three Rivers Board has received the
     written opinion of Sandler O'Neill & Partners, L.P. to the effect that as
     of the date hereof the consideration to be received by the holders of Three
     Rivers Common Stock in the Merger is fair to the

                                       19

     holders of Three Rivers Common Stock from a financial point of view.

               (i)   No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations
          with, any Governmental Authority or with any third party are required
          to be made or obtained by Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries in
          connection with the execution, delivery or performance by Three Rivers
          of this Agreement or to consummate the Merger except for (A) filings
          of applications, notices and the Agreement to Merge, as applicable,

          certificate of merger with the OSS pursuant to the OGCL and the
          Articles of Merger with the DSCP pursuant to the PBCL. As of the date
          hereof, Three Rivers is not aware of any reason why the approvals set
          forth in Section 7.01(b) will not be received without the imposition
          of a condition, restriction or requirement of the type described in
          Section 7.01(b).

          approvals referred to above and expiration of related regulatory
          waiting periods, and required filings under federal and state
          securities laws, the execution, delivery and performance of this
          Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
          do not and will not (A) constitute a breach or violation of, or a
          default under, or give rise to any Lien, any acceleration of remedies
          or any right of termination under, any law, rule or regulation or any
          judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license, or agreement,
          indenture or instrument of Three Rivers or of any of its Subsidiaries
          or to which Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries or properties is
          subject or bound, (B) constitute a breach or violation of, or a
          default under, the Three Rivers Articles or the Three Rivers By-Laws,
          or (C) require any consent or approval under any such law; rule,
          regulation, judgment, decree, order, governmental permit or license,

     or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (B) did not and will not
     contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
     fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
     therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading; and each of the consolidated balance sheets contained in or
     incorporated by reference into any such SEC Document (including the related
     notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly present, the
     consolidated financial position of Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries as of
     its date, and each of the consolidated

                                       20

     such Three Rivers SEC Documents (including any related notes and schedules

          together with all other facts, circumstances and events (described in

     litigation, claim or other proceeding before any court or governmental
     agency is pending against Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries and, to

          letter or similar submission.

          (j)  Compliance with Laws. Except as Previously Disclosed, each of
     Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries:

               (i)    is in compliance with all applicable federal, state, local

     of its Subsidiaries and in which any employee or former employee (the
     "Employees"), consultant or former consultant (the "Consultants") or
     director or former director (the "Directors") of Three Rivers or any of its
     Subsidiaries participates or to which any such Employees, Consultants or
     Directors are a party (the "Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Neither Three
     Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries has any commitment to create any
     additional Compensation and Benefit Plan or to modify or change any
     existing Compensation and Benefit Plan, except as otherwise contemplated by
     Section 4.01(e) of this Agreement.

               (ii)   Each Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and
          administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
          with applicable law, including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code,
          the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
          Employment Act, or any regulations or rules promulgated thereunder,
          and all filings, disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code,
          the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in
          Employment Act and any other applicable law have been timely made.
          Each Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension
          benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension
          Plan") and which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
          the Code has received a favorable determination letter (including a
          determination that the related trust under such Compensation and
          Benefit Plan is exempt from tax under Section 501(a) of the Code) from
          the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"), and Three Rivers is not aware of
          any circumstances likely to result in revocation of any such favorable
          determination letter. There is no material pending or, to the
          knowledge of Three Rivers, threatened legal action, suit or claim
          relating to the Compensation and Benefit Plans other than routine
          claims for benefits thereunder. Neither Three Rivers nor any of its
          Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any
          action, with respect to any Compensation and Benefit Plan that would
          reasonably be expected to subject Three Rivers or any of its
          Subsidiaries to a tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the
          Code or Section 502 of ERISA, assuming for purposes of Section 4975 of
          the Code that the taxable period of any such transaction expired as of
          the date hereof.

               (iii)  No liability (other than for payment of premiums to the
          PBGC which have been made or will be made on a timely basis) under
          Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by Three
          Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any ongoing, frozen
          or terminated "single-employer plan," within the meaning of Section
          4001(a)(15) of ERISA, currently or formerly maintained by any of them,
          or any single-employer plan of any entity (an "ERISA Affiliate") which
          is considered one employer with Three Rivers under Section 4001(a)(14)
          of ERISA or Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate
          Plan"). None of Three Rivers, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA
          Affiliate has contributed, or has been obligated to contribute, to a
          multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA at any time
          since September 26, 1980. No notice of a "reportable event", within
          the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA for which the 30-day reporting
          requirement has not been waived, has been required to be filed for any
          Compensation and Benefit Plan or by any ERISA

                                       23

<PAGE>

          Affiliate Plan within the 12-month period ending on the date hereof,
          and no such notice will be required to be filed as a result of the
          transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The PBGC has not
          instituted proceedings to terminate any Pension Plan or ERISA
          Affiliate Plan and, to Three Rivers' knowledge, no condition exists
          that presents a material risk that such proceedings will be
          instituted. To the knowledge of Three Rivers, there is no pending
          investigation or enforcement action by the PBGC, the Department of
          Labor or IRS or any other governmental agency with respect to any
          Compensation and Benefit Plan. Except as previously disclosed, under
          each Pension Plan and ERISA Affiliate Plan, as of the date of the most
          recent actuarial valuation performed prior to the date of this
          Agreement, the actuarially determined present value of all "benefit
          liabilities", within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA (as
          determined on the basis of the actuarial assumptions contained in such
          actuarial valuation of such Pension Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan), did
          not exceed the then current value of the assets of such Pension Plan
          or ERISA Affiliate Plan and since such date there has been neither an
          adverse change in the financial condition of such Pension Plan or
          ERISA Affiliate Plan nor any amendment or other change to such Pension
          Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan that would increase the amount of
          benefits thereunder which reasonably could be expected to change such
          result.

               (iv)   All contributions required to be made under the terms of
          any Compensation and Benefit Plan or ERISA Affiliate Plan have been
          timely made in cash or have been reflected on Three Rivers' Financial
          Statements (as defined in Section 5.03(q)(i) below) as of December 31,
          2001. Neither any Pension Plan nor any ERISA Affiliate Plan has an
          "accumulated funding deficiency" (whether or not waived) within the
          meaning of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA and all
          required payments to the PBGC with respect to each Pension Plan or
          ERISA Affiliate Plan have been made on or before their due dates. None
          of Three Rivers, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate (x)
          has provided, or would reasonably be expected to be required to
          provide, security to any Pension Plan or to any ERISA Affiliate Plan
          pursuant to Section 401(a)(29) of the Code, and (y) has taken any
          action, or omitted to take any action, that has resulted, or would
          reasonably be expected to result, in the imposition of a lien under
          Section 412(n) of the Code or pursuant to ERISA.

               (v)    Neither Three Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
          obligations to provide retiree health and life insurance or other
          retiree death benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan, other
          than benefits mandated by Section 4980B of the Code. There has been no
          communication to Employees by Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries
          that would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such
          Employees retiree health or life insurance or other retiree death
          benefits on a permanent basis.

               (vi)   Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries do not maintain any
          Compensation and Benefit Plans covering foreign Employees.

               (vii)  With respect to each Compensation and Benefit Plan, if

                                       24

<PAGE>

          applicable, Three Rivers has provided or made available to Sky, true
          and complete copies of existing: (A) Compensation and Benefit Plan
          documents and amendments thereto; (B) trust instruments and insurance
          contracts; (C) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with the IRS; (D) most
          recent actuarial report and financial statement; (E) the most recent
          summary plan description; (F) forms filed with the PBGC within the
          past year (other than for premium payments); (G) most recent
          determination letter issued by the IRS; (H) any Form 5310 or Form 5330
          filed within the past year with the IRS; and (I) most recent
          nondiscrimination tests performed under ERISA and the Code (including
          401(k) and 401(m) tests).

               (viii)  Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(m)(viii) of Three
          Rivers' Disclosure Schedule, the consummation of the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement would not, directly or indirectly
          (including, without limitation, as a result of any termination of
          employment prior to or following the Effective Time) reasonably be
          expected to (A) entitle any Employee, Consultant or Director to any
          payment (including severance pay or similar compensation) or any
          increase in compensation, (B) result in the vesting or acceleration of
          any benefits under any Compensation and Benefit Plan or (C) result in
          any material increase in benefits payable under any Compensation and
          Benefit Plan.

               (ix)    Neither Three Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries
          maintains any compensation plans, programs or arrangements the
          payments under which would not reasonably be expected to be deductible
          as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m) of the Code and
          the regulations issued thereunder.

               (x)     Except as disclosed on Section 5.03(m)(x) of Three
          Rivers' Disclosure Schedule, as a result, directly or indirectly, of
          the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without
          limitation, as a result of any termination of employment prior to or
          following the Effective Time), none of Sky, Three Rivers or the
          Surviving Corporation, or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
          obligated to make a payment that would be characterized as an "excess
          parachute payment" to an individual who is a "disqualified individual"
          (as such terms are defined in Section 280G of the Code) of Three
          Rivers on a consolidated basis, without regard to whether such payment
          is reasonable compensation for personal services performed or to be
          performed in the future.

          (n)  Labor Matters. Neither Three Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries
     is a party to or is bound by any collective bargaining agreement, contract
     or other agreement or understanding with a labor union or labor
     organization, nor is Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries the subject of
     a proceeding asserting that it or any such Subsidiary has committed an
     unfair labor practice (within the meaning of the National Labor Relations
     Act) or seeking to compel Three Rivers or any such Subsidiary to bargain
     with any labor organization as to wages or conditions of employment, nor is
     there any strike or other labor dispute involving it or any of its
     Subsidiaries pending or, to Three Rivers' knowledge, threatened, nor is
     Three Rivers aware of any activity involving its or any of its
     Subsidiaries' employees seeking to certify a collective bargaining unit or
     engaging in other organizational activity.

                                       25

          (o)  Takeover Laws. Three Rivers has taken all action required to be
     taken by it in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby from, and this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby are exempt from, the requirements of any "moratorium";
     "control share", "fair price", "affiliate transaction", "business
     combination" or other antitakeover laws and regulations of any state
     (collectively, "Takeover Laws") applicable to it, including, without
     limitation, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and including, without
     limitation, Subchapters D (Section 2538), E, F, G, H, I and J of Chapter 25
     of the PBCL.

          (p)  Environmental Matters. Except as Previously Disclosed, no Three
     Rivers' knowledge, neither the conduct nor operation of Three Rivers or its
     Subsidiaries nor any condition of any property presently or previously
     owned, leased or operated by any of them (including, without limitation, in
     a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of them holds a Lien,
     violates or violated Environmental Laws and to Three Rivers' knowledge, no
     condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any of them or
     any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is
     reasonably likely to result in liability under Environmental Laws. To Three
     Rivers' knowledge, neither Three Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries has
     received any notice from any person or entity that Three Rivers or its
     Subsidiaries or the operation or condition of any property ever owned,
     leased, operated, or held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any
     of them are or were in violation of or otherwise are alleged to have
     liability under any Environmental Law, including, but not limited to,
     responsibility (or potential responsibility) for the cleanup or other
     remediation of any pollutants, contaminants, or hazardous or toxic wastes,
     substances or materials at, on, beneath, or originating from any such
     property.

          (q)  Tax Matters. (i) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
     or with respect to Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries have been duly filed,
     (ii) all Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns referred to in clause (i)
     have been paid in full, (iii) except as Previously Disclosed, the Tax
     Returns referred to in clause (i) have been examined by the IRS or the
     appropriate state, local or foreign taxing authority or the period for
     assessment of the Taxes in respect of which such Tax Returns were required
     to be filed has expired, (iv) all deficiencies asserted or assessments made
     as a result of such examinations have been paid in full, (v) no issues that
     have been raised by the relevant taxing authority in connection with the
     examination of any of the Tax Returns referred to in clause (i) are
     currently pending, and (vi) no waivers of statutes of limitation have been
     given by or requested with respect to any Taxes of Three Rivers or its
     Subsidiaries. Three Rivers has made or will make available to Sky true and
     correct copies of the United States federal income Tax Returns filed by
     Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries for each of the three most recent fiscal
     years ended on or before December 31, 2000. Neither Three Rivers nor any of
     its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to income, franchise or
     similar Taxes that accrued on or before the end of the most recent period
     covered by Three Rivers' SEC Documents filed prior to the date hereof in
     excess of the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are reflected in
     the financial statements included in Three Rivers' SEC Documents filed on
     or prior to the date hereof ("Three Rivers' Financial Statements"). As of
     the date hereof, neither Three Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
     reason to believe that any conditions exist that might prevent or impede
     the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization within the meaning of
     Section 368(a) of the Code.

                                       26

<PAGE>

               (ii)  No Tax is required to be withheld pursuant to Section 1445
          of the Code as a result of the transfer contemplated by this
          Agreement.

          (r)  Risk Management Instruments. All material interest rate swaps,
     caps, floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other
     similar risk management arrangements, whether entered into for Three
     Rivers' own account, or for the account of one or more of Three Rivers'
     Subsidiaries or their customers (all of which are listed on Three Rivers'
     Disclosure Schedule), were entered into (i) in accordance with prudent
     business practices and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and
     regulatory policies and (ii) with counterparties believed to be financially
     responsible at the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally
     binding obligation of Three Rivers or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable
     in accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
     applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
     transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
     creditors' rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force
     and effect. Neither Three Rivers nor its Subsidiaries, nor to Three Rivers'
     knowledge any other party thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations
     under any such agreement or arrangement.

          (s)  Books and Records. The books and records of Three Rivers and its
     Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all
     material respects, have been maintained in accordance with sound business
     practices and the requirements of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, and
     there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind contained
     or reflected therein and they fairly reflect the substance of events and
     transactions included therein.

          (t)  Insurance. Three Rivers' Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of
     the insurance policies, binders, or bonds maintained by Three Rivers or its
     Subsidiaries. Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable
     insurers against such risks and in such amounts as the management of Three
     Rivers reasonably has determined to be prudent in accordance with industry
     practices. All such insurance policies are in full force and effect; Three
     Rivers and its Subsidiaries are not in material default thereunder; and all
     claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

          (u)  Three Rivers Off Balance Sheet Transactions. Section 5.03(u) of
     Three Rivers' Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of
     all affiliated Three Rivers entities, including without limitation all
     special purpose entities, limited purpose entities and qualified special
     purpose entities, in which Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries or any
     officer or director of Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries has an
     economic or management interest. Section 5.03(u) of Three Rivers'
     Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a true and complete list of all
     transactions, arrangements, and other relationships between or among any
     such Three Rivers affiliated entity, Three Rivers, any of its Subsidiaries,
     and any officer or director of Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries
     which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Three
     Rivers (each, a "Three Rivers Off Balance Sheet Transaction"), along with
     the following information with respect to each such Three Rivers Off
     Balance Sheet Transaction: (i) the business purpose, activities, and
     economic substance; (ii) the key terms and conditions; (iii) the potential
     risk to Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries; (iv) the amount of any
     guarantee,

                                       27

<PAGE>

     line of credit, standby letter of credit or commitment, or any other type
     of arrangement, that could require Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries
     to fund any obligations under any such transaction; and (v) any other
     information that could have a Material Adverse Effect on Three Rivers or
     any of its Subsidiaries.

          (v)  Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in this
     Section 5.03 do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
     to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements and
     information contained in this Section 5.03 not misleading.

          (w)  Material Adverse Change. Except as Previously Disclosed, Three
     Rivers has not, on a consolidated basis, suffered a change in its business,
     financial condition or results of operations since December 31, 2000,
     except as disclosed in the Three Rivers SEC Documents, that has had a
     Material Adverse Effect on Three Rivers.

          (x)  Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as Previously
     Disclosed, neither Three Rivers nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
     liability (contingent or otherwise) that is material to Three Rivers on a
     consolidated basis, or that, when combined with all liabilities as to
     similar matters would be material to Three Rivers on a consolidated basis,
     except as disclosed in Three Rivers' Financial Statements.

          (y)  Properties. Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries have good and
     marketable title, free and clear of all liens, encumbrances, charges,
     defaults or equitable interests to all of the properties and assets, real
     and personal, reflected on Three Rivers' Financial Statements as being
     owned by Three Rivers as of December 31, 2000 or acquired after such date,
     except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet due and payable, (ii)
     pledges to secure deposits and other liens incurred in the ordinary course
     of banking business, (iii) such imperfections of title, easements,
     encumbrances, liens, charges, defaults or equitable interests, if any, as
     do not affect the use of properties or assets subject thereto or affected
     thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such
     properties, (iv) dispositions and encumbrances in the ordinary course of
     business, and (v) liens on properties acquired in foreclosure or on account
     of debts previously contracted. All leases pursuant to which Three Rivers
     or any of its Subsidiaries, as lessee, leases real or personal property
     (except for leases that have expired by their terms or that Three Rivers or
     any such Subsidiary has agreed to terminate since the date hereof) are
     valid without default thereunder by the lessee or, to Three Rivers'
     knowledge, the lessor.

          (aa) Loans. Each loan reflected as an asset in Three Rivers' Financial
     Statements and each balance sheet date subsequent thereto, other than loans
     the unpaid balance of which does not exceed $500,000 in the aggregate, (i)
     is evidenced by notes, agreements or other evidences of indebtedness which
     are true, genuine and what they purport to be, (ii) to the extent secured,
     has been secured by valid liens and security interests which have been
     perfected, and (iii) is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
     obligor named therein, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
     bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws of general
     applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general
     equity principles. Except as Previously Disclosed, as of December 31, 2001,
     Bank is not a party to a loan, including

                                       28

<PAGE>

     any loan guaranty, with any director, executive officer or 5% stockholder
     of Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries or any person, corporation or
     enterprise controlling, controlled by or under common control with any of
     the foregoing. All loans and extensions of credit that have been made by
     Bank and that are subject either to Section 22(b) of the Federal Reserve
     Act, as amended, comply therewith.

          (bb) Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses
     reflected on Three Rivers' Financial Statements, as of their respective
     dates, is adequate in all material respects under the requirements of
     generally accepted accounting principles to provide for reasonably
     anticipated losses on outstanding loans.

          (cc) Repurchase Agreements. With respect to all agreements pursuant to
     which Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries has purchased securities
     subject to an agreement to resell, if any, Three Rivers or such Subsidiary,
     as the case may be, has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest
     in or evidence of ownership in book entry form of the government securities
     or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of
     such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

          (dd) Deposit Insurance. The deposits of Bank are insured by the FDIC
     in accordance with The Federal Deposit Insurance Act ("FDIA"), and Bank has
     paid all assessments and filed all reports required by the FDIA.

          pursuant to this Agreement. The outstanding shares of Sky Common Stock
          have been duly authorized and are validly issued and outstanding,
          fully paid and nonassessable, and subject to no preemptive rights (and
          were not issued in violation of any preemptive rights).

               (ii) The shares of Sky Common Stock to be issued in exchange for

          preemptive rights.

          (c) Subsidiaries. Sky has Previously Disclosed a list of all its
     Subsidiaries together with the jurisdiction or organization of each
     Subsidiary. Each of Sky's Subsidiaries has been duly organized and is
     validly existing in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
     organization, and is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
     in the jurisdictions where its ownership or leasing of property or the
     conduct of its business requires it to be so qualified and, except as
     Previously Disclosed, it owns, directly or indirectly, all the issued and
     outstanding equity securities of each of its Significant Subsidiaries.

          (d) Corporate Power. Each of Sky and its Subsidiaries has the
     corporate power and authority to carry on its business as it is now being
     conducted and to own all its properties and assets; and Sky has the

     obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
     contemplated hereby.

          (e) Corporate Authority; Authorized and Effective Agreement. Subject
     in the case of this Agreement to receipt of the requisite adoption of this
     Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Sky
     Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, this Agreement and the transactions
     contemplated hereby have been authorized by all necessary corporate action
     of Sky and the Sky Board prior to the date hereof and no stockholder
     approval is required on the part of Sky. The Agreement to Merge, when
     executed by Sky Bank, shall have been approved by the Board of Directors of
     Sky Bank and by the Sky Board, as the sole stockholder of Sky Bank. This
     Agreement is a valid and legally binding agreement of Sky, enforceable in
     accordance with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by
     applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent
     transfer and similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
     creditors rights or by general equity principles).

          (f) Regulatory Approvals; No Defaults.

               (i)  No consents or approvals of, or filings or registrations
          with, any Governmental Authority or with any third party are required
          to be made or obtained by Sky or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
          with the execution, delivery or performance by Sky of this Agreement
          or to consummate the Merger except for (A) the filing of applications,
          notices or the Agreement to Merge, as applicable, with the federal and
          state banking authorities; (B) the filing and declaration of
          effectiveness of the Registration Statement; (C) the filings of the

          certificate of merger with the OSS pursuant to the OGCL and the
          Articles of Merger with the DSCP pursuant to the PBCL; (D) such
          filings as are required to be made or approvals as are required to be
          obtained under the securities or "Blue Sky" laws of various states in
          connection with the issuance of Sky Common Stock in the Merger; and
          (E) receipt of the approvals set forth in Section 7.01(b). As of the
          date hereof, Sky is not aware of any reason why the approvals set
          forth in Section 7.01(b) will not be received without the imposition
          of a condition, restriction or requirement of the type described in
          Section 7.01(b).

               (ii) Subject to the satisfaction of the requirements referred to
          in the preceding paragraph and expiration of the related waiting
          periods, and required filings under federal and state securities laws,
          the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
          consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby do not and will
          not (A) constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, or
          give rise to any Lien, any acceleration of remedies or any right of
          termination under, any law, rule or regulation or any judgment,
          decree, order, governmental permit or license, or agreement, indenture
          or instrument of Sky or of any of its Subsidiaries or to which Sky or
          any of its Subsidiaries or properties is subject or bound, (B)
          constitute a breach or violation of, or a default under, the Articles
          of Incorporation or Code of Regulations (or similar governing
          documents) of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries, or (C) require any
          consent or approval under any such law, rule, regulation, judgment,

          instrument.

          December 31, 2001, and all other reports, registration statements,
          definitive proxy statements or information statements filed or to be
          filed by it or any of its Subsidiaries with the SEC subsequent to
          December 31, 2001 under the Securities Act, or under Section 13, 14 or
          15(d) of the Exchange Act, in the form filed or to be filed
          (collectively, "Sky SEC Documents") as of the date filed, (A) complied
          or will comply in all material respects with the applicable
          requirements under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case
          may be, and (B) did not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
          material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
          therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and each of
          the balance sheets or statements of condition contained in or
          incorporated by reference into any such Sky SEC Document (including
          the related notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will
          fairly present, the financial position of Sky and its Subsidiaries as
          of its date, and each of the statements of income or results of
          operations and changes in stockholders' equity and cash flows or
          equivalent statements in such Sky SEC Documents (including any related
          notes and schedules thereto) fairly presents, or will fairly present,
          the results of operations, changes in stockholders' equity and cash
          flows, as the case may be, of Sky and its Subsidiaries for the periods
          to which they relate, in each case in accordance with generally
          accepted accounting principles consistently applied

                                       31

<PAGE>

          during the periods involved, except in each case as may be noted
          therein, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence
          of footnotes in the case of unaudited statements.

               (ii)  Since December 31, 2001, no event has occurred or
          circumstance arisen that, individually or taken together with all
          other facts, circumstances and events (described in any paragraph of
          Section 5.04 or otherwise), is reasonably likely to have a Material
          Adverse Effect with respect to Sky, except as disclosed in the Sky SEC
          Documents.

          (h)  Litigation; Regulatory Action.

               (i)   Except as Previously Disclosed, no material litigation,
          claim or other proceeding before any court or governmental agency is
          pending against Sky or any of its Subsidiaries and, to the best of
          Sky's knowledge, no such litigation, claim or other proceeding has
          been threatened.

               (ii)  Except as Previously Disclosed, neither Sky nor any of its
          Subsidiaries or properties is a party to or is subject to any order,
          decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement
          with, or a commitment letter or similar submission to, or
          extraordinary supervisory letter from a Regulatory Authority, nor has
          Sky or any of its Subsidiaries been advised by a Regulatory Authority
          that such agency is contemplating issuing or requesting (or is
          considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) any such
          order, decree, agreement, memorandum of understanding, commitment
          letter, supervisory letter or similar submission.

          (i)  Compliance with Laws. Each of Sky and its Subsidiaries:

               (i)   is in material compliance with all applicable federal,
          state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances,
          rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable thereto or to the
          employees conducting such businesses, including, without limitation,
          the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community
          Reinvestment Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and all other
          applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
          business practices; and

               (ii)  has all material permits, licenses, authorizations, orders
          and approvals of, and has made all material filings, applications and
          registrations with, all Governmental Authorities that are required in
          order to permit them to conduct their businesses substantially as
          presently conducted; all such permits, licenses, certificates of
          authority, orders and approvals are in full force and effect and, to
          the best of its knowledge, no suspension or cancellation of any of
          them is threatened; and

               (iii) has received, since December 31, 2000, no notification or
          communication from any Governmental Authority (A) asserting that Sky
          or any of its Subsidiaries is not in material compliance with any of
          the statutes,

                                       32

<PAGE>

          regulations, or ordinances which such Governmental Authority enforces
          or (B) threatening to revoke any license, franchise, permit, or
          governmental authorization (nor, to Sky's knowledge, do any grounds
          for any of the foregoing exist).

          (j)  Brokerage and Finder's Fees. Except for fees payable to its
     financial advisor, Lehman Brothers, Sky has not employed any broker,
     finder, or agent, or agreed to pay or incurred any brokerage fee, finder's
     fee, commission or other similar form of compensation in connection with
     this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (k)  Takeover Laws. Sky has taken all action required to be taken by
     it in order to exempt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
     hereby from, and this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
     are exempt from, the requirements of any Takeover Laws applicable to Sky.

          (l)  Tax Matters. (i) All Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
     or with respect to Sky and its Subsidiaries have been duly filed, (ii) all
     Taxes shown to be due on the Tax Returns referred to in clause (i) have
     been paid in full as required, (iii) except as Previously Disclosed, the
     Tax Returns referred to in clause (i) have been examined by the IRS or the
     appropriate state, local or foreign taxing authority or the period for
     assessment of the Taxes in respect of which such Tax Returns were required
     to be filed has expired (iv) except as Previously Disclosed, all
     deficiencies asserted or assessments made as a result of such examinations
     have been paid in full, (v) no issues that have been raised by the relevant
     taxing authority in connection with the examination of any of the Tax
     Returns referred to in clause (i) are currently pending, and (vi) except as
     Previously Disclosed, no waivers of statutes of limitation have been given
     by or requested with respect to any Taxes of Sky or its Subsidiaries.
     Neither Sky nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liability with respect to
     income, franchise or similar Taxes that accrued on or before the end of the
     most recent period covered by Sky's SEC Documents filed prior to the date
     hereof in excess of the amounts accrued with respect thereto that are
     reflected in the financial statements included in Sky's SEC Documents filed
     on or prior to the date hereof ("Sky's Financial Statements"). As of the
     date hereof, Sky has no reason to believe that any conditions exist that
     might prevent or impede the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization with
     the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          (m)  Books and Records. The books and records of Sky and its
     Subsidiaries have been fully, properly and accurately maintained in all
     material respects, have been maintained in accordance with sound business
     practices and the requirements of Section 13(b)(2) of the Exchange Act, and
     there are no material inaccuracies or discrepancies of any kind contained
     or reflected therein, and they fairly present the substance of events and
     transactions included therein.

          (n)  Insurance. Sky's Disclosure Schedule sets forth all of the
     insurance policies, binders, or bonds maintained by Sky or its
     Subsidiaries. Sky and its Subsidiaries are insured with reputable insurers
     against such risks and in such amounts as the management of Sky reasonably
     has determined to be prudent in accordance with

                                       33

<PAGE>

     industry practices. All such insurance policies are in full force and
     effect; Sky and its Subsidiaries are not in material default thereunder;
     and all claims thereunder have been filed in due and timely fashion.

          (o)  Sky Off Balance Sheet Transactions. Section 5.04(o) of Sky's
     Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of all affiliated
     Sky entities, including without limitation all special purpose entities,
     limited purpose entities and qualified special purpose entities, in which
     Sky or any of its Subsidiaries or any officer or director of Sky or any of
     its Subsidiaries has an economic or management interest. Section 5.04(o) of
     Sky's Disclosure Schedule also sets forth a true and complete list of all
     material transactions, arrangements, and other relationships between or
     among any such Sky affiliated entity, Sky, any of its Subsidiaries, and any
     officer or director of Sky or any of its Subsidiaries which are not
     reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Sky (each, a "Sky Off
     Balance Sheet Transaction"), along with the following information with
     respect to each such Sky Off Balance Sheet Transaction: (i) the business
     purpose, activities, and economic substance; (ii) the key terms and
     conditions; (iii) the potential material risk to Sky or any of its
     Subsidiaries; (iv) the amount of any guarantee, line of credit, standby
     letter of credit or commitment, or any other type of arrangement, that
     could require Sky or any of its Subsidiaries to fund any obligations under
     any such transaction; and (v) any other information that could have a
     Material Adverse Effect on Sky or any of its Subsidiaries.

          (p)  Contracts. Neither Sky nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
     under any contract, agreement, commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance
     policy or other instrument to which it is a party, by which its respective
     assets, business, or operations may be bound or affected in any way, or
     under which it or its respective assets, business, or operations receive
     benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time
     or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default.

          (q)  Disclosure. The representations and warranties contained in this
     Section 5.04 do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
     to state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements and
     information contained in this Section 5.04 not misleading.

          (r)  Risk Management Instruments. All material interest rate swaps,
     caps, floors, option agreements, futures and forward contracts and other
     similar risk management arrangements, whether entered into for Sky's own
     account, or for the account of one or more of its Subsidiaries or their
     customers, were entered into (i) in accordance with prudent business
     practices and all applicable laws, rules, regulations and regulatory
     policies and with counterparties believed to be financially responsible at
     the time; and each of them constitutes the valid and legally binding
     obligation of Sky or one of its Subsidiaries, enforceable in accordance
     with its terms (except as enforceability may be limited by applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer and
     similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors'
     rights or by general equity principles), and is in full force and effect.
     Neither Sky nor its Subsidiaries, nor to Sky's knowledge any other party
     thereto, is in breach of any of its obligations under any such agreement or
     arrangement in any material respect.

                                       34

<PAGE>

          (s) Material Adverse Change. Sky has not, on a consolidated basis,
     suffered a change in its business, financial condition or results of
     operations since December 31, 2001 that has had a Material Adverse Effect
     on Sky, except as described in the Sky SEC Documents.

          (t) Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses reflected
     on Sky's Financial Statements, as of their respective dates, is adequate in
     all material respects under the requirements of generally accepted
     accounting principles to provide for reasonably anticipated losses on
     outstanding loans.

          (u) Repurchase Agreements. With respect to all agreements pursuant to
     which Sky or any of its Subsidiaries has purchased securities subject to an
     agreement to resell, if any, Sky or such Subsidiary, as the case may be,
     has a valid, perfected first lien or security interest in or evidence of
     ownership in book entry form of the government securities or other
     collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and the value of such
     collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured thereby.

          (v) Deposit Insurance. The deposits of Sky Bank are insured by the
     FDIC in accordance with the FDIA, and Sky Bank has paid all assessments and
     filed all reports required by the FDIA.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                    Covenants

     6.01 Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, each of Three Rivers and Sky agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts in good faith to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or desirable, or advisable under
applicable laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger as promptly as
practicable and otherwise to enable consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall cooperate fully with the other party hereto to
that end.

     6.02 Stockholder Approval. Three Rivers agrees to take, in accordance with
applicable law and the Three Rivers Articles and Three Rivers By-Laws, all
action necessary to convene an appropriate meeting of its stockholders to
consider and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement and any other matters
required to be approved or adopted by Three Rivers' stockholders for
consummation of the Merger (including any adjournment or postponement, the
"Three Rivers Meeting"), as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective. The Three Rivers Board shall recommend that its
stockholders adopt this Agreement at the Three Rivers Meeting unless the Three
Rivers Board, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that it is probable that such recommendation would be a breach of its
fiduciary duties under applicable Pennsylvania law and Three Rivers' Articles.

     6.03 Registration Statement. (a) Sky agrees to prepare pursuant to all
applicable laws, rules and regulations a registration statement on Form S-4 (the
"Registration Statement") to be filed by Sky with the SEC in connection with the
issuance of Sky Common Stock in the Merger (including the proxy statement and
prospectus and other proxy solicitation materials of Three

                                       35

<PAGE>

Rivers constituting a part thereof (the "Proxy Statement") and all related
documents). Three Rivers agrees to cooperate, and to cause its Subsidiaries to
cooperate, with Sky, its counsel and its accountants, in preparation of the
Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement; and provided that Three Rivers
and its Subsidiaries have cooperated as required above, Sky agrees to file the
Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement (together, the
"Proxy/Prospectus") with the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of
Three Rivers and Sky agrees to use all reasonable efforts to cause the
Proxy/Prospectus to be declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as reasonably practicable after filing thereof. Sky also agrees to use all
reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Registration
Statement, all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and
approvals required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Three Rivers agrees to furnish to Sky all information concerning Three Rivers,
its Subsidiaries, officers, directors and stockholders as may be reasonably
requested in connection with the foregoing.

     (b)  Each of Three Rivers and Sky agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it for
inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the Registration Statement will,
at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or supplement thereto,
if any, becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and (ii) the
Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of
mailing to the Three Rivers stockholders and at the time of the Three Rivers
Meeting, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading or any statement which, in the light
of the circumstances under which such statement is made, will be false or
misleading with respect to any material fact, or which will omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein not false or
misleading or necessary to correct any statement in any earlier statement in the
Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto. Each of Three Rivers and
Sky further agrees that if it shall become aware prior to the Effective Date of
any information furnished by it that would cause any of the statements in the
Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or
to omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not
false or misleading, to promptly inform the other party thereof and to take the
necessary steps to correct the Proxy Statement.

     (c)  Sky agrees to advise Three Rivers, promptly after Sky receives notice
thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become effective or any
supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any stop order or the
suspension of the qualification of Sky Stock for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, of the initiation or threat of any proceeding for any such
purpose, or of any request by the SEC for the amendment or supplement of the
Registration Statement or for additional information.

     6.04 Press Releases. Each of Three Rivers and Sky agrees that it will not,
without the prior approval of the other party, issue any press release or
written statement for general circulation relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, except as otherwise required by applicable law or
regulation or NASDAQ rules.

     6.05 Access; Information. (a) Each of Three Rivers and Sky agrees that upon

                                       36

<PAGE>

reasonable notice and subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of
information, it shall afford the other party and the other party's officers,
employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives, such
access during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective
Time to the books, records (including, without limitation, tax returns and work
papers of independent auditors), properties, personnel and to such other
information as any party may reasonably request and, during such period, it
shall furnish promptly to such other party (i) a copy of each material report,
schedule and other document filed by it pursuant to federal or state securities
or banking laws, and (ii) all other information concerning the business,
properties and personnel of it as the other may reasonably request.

     (b)  Each agrees that it will not, and will cause its representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.05 (as well as any
other information obtained prior to the date hereof in connection with the
entering into of this Agreement) for any purpose unrelated to the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to the requirements
of law, each party will keep confidential, and will cause its representatives to
keep confidential, all information and documents obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.05 (as well as any other information obtained prior to the date hereof
in connection with the entering into of this Agreement) unless such information

other sources not known by such party to be bound by a confidentiality
obligation, (iii) is disclosed with the prior written approval of the party to
which such information pertains or (iv) is or becomes readily ascertainable from
published information or trade sources. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall otherwise
fail to be consummated, each party shall promptly cause all copies of documents
or extracts thereof containing information and data as to another party hereto
to be returned to the party which furnished the same. No investigation by either
party of the business and affairs of the other shall affect or be deemed to
modify or waive any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this
Agreement, or the conditions to either party's obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (c)  During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, each party shall promptly furnish the other with copies of all monthly and
other interim financial statements produced in the ordinary course of business
as the same shall become available.

     6.06 Acquisition Proposals. Three Rivers agrees that it shall not, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries' officers, directors,
agents, advisors and affiliates not to, solicit or encourage inquiries or
proposals with respect to, or engage in any negotiations concerning, or provide
any confidential information to, or have any discussions with, any person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal, except to the extent that the Three
Rivers Board, after consultation with independent legal counsel, determines in
good faith that it is probable that the failure to take such action would be a
breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Pennsylvania law and Three
Rivers' Articles. It shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with any parties other than Sky with respect to any of the foregoing
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce any confidentiality or
similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal. Three Rivers shall
promptly advise Sky following the receipt by Three Rivers of any Acquisition
Proposal and the substance thereof (including the identity of the person making
such Acquisition Proposal), and advise Sky of any material developments with

                                       37

respect to such Acquisition Proposal promptly upon the occurrence thereof.

     6.07  Affiliate Agreements. Not later than the 15th day prior to the
mailing of the Proxy Statement, Three Rivers shall deliver to Sky a schedule of
each person that, to the best of its knowledge, is or is reasonably likely to
be, as of the date of the Three Rivers Meeting, deemed to be an "affiliate" of
Three Rivers (each, a "Three Rivers Affiliate") as that term is used in Rule 145
under the Securities Act or SEC Accounting Series Releases 130 and 135. Three
Rivers shall cause each person who may be deemed to be a Three Rivers Affiliate
to execute and deliver to Three Rivers on or before the date of mailing of the

     6.08  Takeover Laws. No party hereto shall take any action that would cause
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements
imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them shall take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement from, or if necessary challenge the
validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter
in effect.

     6.09  Certain Policies. Prior to the Effective Date, Three Rivers shall,
consistent with generally accepted accounting principles and on a basis mutually
satisfactory to it and Sky, modify and change its loan, litigation and real
estate valuation policies and practices (including loan classifications and
levels of reserves) so as to be applied on a basis that is consistent with that
of Sky; provided, however, that Three Rivers shall not be obligated to take any
such action pursuant to this Section 6.09 unless and until Sky acknowledges that
all conditions to its obligation to consummate the Merger have been satisfied
and certifies to Three Rivers that Sky's representations and warranties, subject
to Section 5.02, are true and correct as of such date and that Sky is otherwise
material in compliance with this Agreement. Three Rivers' representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement shall not be deemed to be
untrue or breached in any respect for any purpose as a consequence of any
modifications or changes undertaken solely on account of this Section 6.09.

respective Subsidiaries shall cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to prepare all documentation, to timely effect all filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of Sky and Three Rivers shall have the right to review
in advance, and to the extent practicable each will consult with the other, in
each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information,
with respect to, and shall be provided in advance so as to reasonably exercise
its right to review in advance, all material written information submitted to
any third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right,
each of the parties hereto agrees to act reasonably and as -promptly as
practicable. Each party hereto

                                       38

<PAGE>

agrees that it will consult with the other party hereto with respect to the
obtaining of all material permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all
third parties and Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and each party will keep the
other party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby.

     (b)  Each party agrees, upon request, to furnish the other party with all
information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers and
stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable
in connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
such other party or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party or Governmental
Authority.

     6.12 Indemnification. (a) Following the Effective Date, Sky shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present directors, officers and
employees of Three Rivers and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party")
against all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments,
fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of actions or omissions occurring
on or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) to the fullest extent that Three
Rivers is permitted to indemnify (and advance expenses to) its directors,
officers, and employees under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the
Three Rivers Articles and the Three Rivers By-Laws as in effect on the date
hereof; provided that any determination required to be made with respect to
whether an officer's, director's or employee's conduct complies with the
standards set forth under Pennsylvania law, the Three Rivers Articles and the
Three Rivers By-Laws shall be made by independent counsel (which shall not be
counsel that provides material services to Sky) selected by Sky and reasonably
acceptable to such officer, director or employee.

     (b)  For a period of three years from the Effective Time, Sky shall use its
reasonable best efforts to provide that portion of director's and officer's
liability insurance that serves to reimburse the present and former officers and
directors of Three Rivers or any of its Subsidiaries (determined as of the
Effective Time) (as opposed to Three Rivers) with respect to claims against such
directors and officers arising from facts or events which occurred before the
Effective Time, on terms no less favorable than those in effect on the date
hereof; provided, however, that Sky may substitute therefor policies providing
at least comparable coverage containing terms and conditions no less favorable
than those in effect on the date hereof; and provided, further, that officers
and directors of Three Rivers or any Subsidiary may be required to make
application and provide customary representations and warranties to Sky's
insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

     (c)  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under Section
6.12(a), upon learning of any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation
described above, shall promptly notify Sky thereof; provided that the failure so
to notify shall not affect the obligations of Sky under Section 6.12(a) unless
and to the extent that Sky is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

     (d)  If Sky or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate with or
merge into any

                                       39

<PAGE>

other entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or substantially all of its assets
to any entity, then and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Sky shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 6.12.

     6.13 Opportunity of Employment; Employee Benefits; Executive Annual
Incentive Plan. (a) The existing employees of Three Rivers shall have the
opportunity to continue as employees of Sky or one of its Subsidiaries, on the
Effective Date; subject, however, to the right of Sky and its Subsidiaries to
terminate any such employees either (i) for "cause" or (ii) pursuant to the
procedures set forth in the Sky Workforce Redesign Process previously disclosed
to Three Rivers. It is understood and agreed that nothing in this Section 6.13
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be deemed to be a contract of employment or
be construed to give said employees any rights other than as employees at will
under applicable law and said employees shall not be deemed to be third-party
beneficiaries of this provision. Each existing Three Rivers employee (except
Terry K. Dunkle, W. Harrison Vail, Vincent Locher, and Anthony M.V. Eramo) who
is not employed with Sky or one of its Subsidiaries for at least the first whole
year following the Effective Date shall be paid by Sky in accordance with Sky's
standard severance policy for employees, with credit for years of Three Rivers
service (including years of service with Three Rivers' predecessors, including
any entities merged into Three Rivers or Bank), reduced by the amount of any
severance payment previously received by such Three Rivers employee from
USBANCORP, Inc. Sky also shall pay each such employee for all unused vacation
time as of the Effective Date, up to a maximum of one year. Terry K. Dunkle, W.
Harrison Vail, and Vincent Locher shall be provided with the automobiles that
Three Rivers provided to them.

     (b)  From and after the Effective Time, Three Rivers employees shall
continue to participate in the Three Rivers employee benefit plans in effect at
the Effective Time unless and until Sky, in its sole discretion, shall determine
that Three Rivers employees shall, subject to applicable eligibility
requirements, participate in employee benefit plans of Sky and that all or some
of the Three Rivers plans shall be terminated or merged into certain employee
benefit plans of Sky. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) Three Rivers' defined
benefit pension plan and any supplemental executive retirement plan shall not be
terminated or merged into any plan of Sky; and (ii) each Three Rivers employee
shall be credited with years of Three Rivers service (including years of service
with Three Rivers' predecessors, to the same extent that Three Rivers credited
such service, including any entities merged into Three Rivers or Bank) for
purposes of eligibility and vesting in the employee benefit plans of Sky, and
shall not be subject to any exclusion or penalty for pre-existing conditions
that were covered under Three Rivers' welfare plans immediately prior to the
Effective Date, or to any waiting period relating to such coverage. If, after
the Effective Date, Sky adopts a new plan or program for its employees or
executives, then to the extent its employees or executives receive past service
credits for any reason, Sky shall credit similarly-situated employees and
executives of Three Rivers with equivalent credit for service with Three Rivers
or its predecessors (including any entities merged into Three Rivers or Bank),
to the same extent that Three Rivers credited service with its predecessors. The
foregoing covenants shall survive the Merger, and Sky shall, before the
Effective Time, adopt resolutions that amend its tax-qualified retirement plans
to provide for Three Rivers service credits referenced herein.

Three Rivers' Executive Annual Incentive Plan shall be prorated based on the
Effective Date (exclusive of any special charges related to the transactions
contemplated hereby), and all quarterly and annual payments due under the
Executive Annual Incentive Plan for the remainder of the year in which the
Effective Date occurs shall be calculated and paid based on such prorated
measures.

     6.14 Notification of Certain Matters. Each of Three Rivers and Sky shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or circumstance known to it
that (i) is reasonably likely, individually or taken together with all other
facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result in any Material Adverse
Effect with respect to it or (ii) would cause or constitute a material breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
herein.

     6.15 Dividend Coordination. It is agreed by the parties hereto that they
will cooperate to assure that as a result of the Merger, during any applicable
period, there shall not be a payment of both a Sky and a Three Rivers dividend.
The parties further agree that if the Effective Date is at the end of a fiscal
quarter, then they will cooperate to assure that the Three Rivers stockholders
receive the dividend declared by Sky, if any, rather than the dividend for that
period, if any, declared by Three Rivers. In no event will the selection of the
Effective Date cause the stockholders of Three Rivers to lose a quarterly or a
portion of a quarterly dividend.

     6.16 Sky Board Representation; Advisory Boards; Severance for Three Rivers
Directors. Sky shall cause its Executive Committee to nominate for election one
director to the Sky Board, who shall also be nominated for Sky's Executive
Committee, which nominee shall be recommended by Three Rivers and selected by
Sky in its discretion. Sky shall establish a regional advisory board for the
region served by Three Rivers, which shall include five members who shall be
recommended by Three Rivers and selected by Sky in its discretion. Any member of
the Three Rivers Board as of the Effective Date who is not appointed to the Sky
Board or such regional advisory board shall be paid a severance payment of
$6,000 promptly after the Effective Date.

     6.17 Tax Treatment. Each of Sky and Three Rivers agrees not to take any
actions subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would adversely affect the
ability of Three Rivers and its stockholders to characterize the Merger as a
tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, and each of Sky and
Three Rivers agrees to take such action as may be reasonably required, if such
action may be reasonably taken to reverse the impact of any past actions which
would adversely impact the ability for the Merger to be characterized as a
tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

     6.18 No Breaches of Representations and Warranties. Between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, without the written consent of the other
party, each of Sky and Three Rivers will not do any act or suffer any omission
of any nature whatsoever which would cause any of the representations or
warranties made in Article V of this Agreement to become untrue or incorrect in
any material respect.

     6.19 Consents. Each of Sky and Three Rivers shall use its best efforts to
obtain any required consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Agreement. Three Rivers and Sky agree to hold the Information in strictest
confidence and shall not use, and shall not disclose directly or indirectly any
of such Information except when, after and to the extent such Information (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public other than through the failure of
Three Rivers or Sky to fulfill its obligations hereunder, (ii) was already known
to the party receiving the Information on a nonconfidential basis prior to the
disclosure or (iii) is subsequently disclosed to the party receiving the
Information on a nonconfidential basis by a third party having no obligation of
confidentiality to the party disclosing the Information. It is agreed and
understood that the obligations of Three Rivers and Sky contained in this
Section 6.22 shall survive the Closing. In the event the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are not consummated, Three Rivers and Sky agree
to return all copies of the Information provided to the other promptly.

of Three Rivers) does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not misleading.

     6.24 Consulting Agreements. Immediately after the Merger, Sky shall enter
into

                                       42

Harrison Vail dated May 7, 2002, all on terms and conditions mutually
satisfactory to the parties thereto.

     6.25 Supplemental IRS Ruling. If Three Rivers and Sky determine after
further investigation that it is necessary, proper, or desirable, or advisable
under applicable laws, to obtain a supplemental ruling from the IRS to the
private letter ruling issued February 4, 2000, as previously supplemented, each
of Three Rivers and Sky agrees to use its reasonable best efforts in good faith
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all

          (b) Breach. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Sky or Three
     Rivers, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of
     the members of its entire Board, in the event of either: (i) a breach by
     the other party of any representation or warranty contained herein (subject
     to the standard set forth in Section 5.02), which breach cannot be or has
     not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the
     breaching party of such breach; or (ii) a breach by the other party of any
     of the covenants or agreements contained herein, which breach cannot be or
     has not been cured within 30 days after the giving of written notice to the
     breaching party of such breach, provided that such breach (whether under
     (i) or (ii)) would be reasonably likely, individually or in the aggregate
     with other breaches, to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

          (c) Delay. At any time prior to the Effective Time, by Sky or Three
     Rivers, if its Board of Directors so determines by vote of a majority of
     the members of its entire Board, in the event that the Merger is not
     consummated by January 31, 2003, except to the extent that the failure of
     the Merger then to be consummated arises out of or results from the knowing
     action or inaction of the party seeking to terminate pursuant to this
     Section 8.01(c).

          (d) No Approval. By Three Rivers or Sky, if its Board of Directors so
     determines by a vote of a majority of the members of its entire Board, in
     the event (i) the approval of any Governmental Authority required for
     consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
     Agreement shall have been denied by final nonappealable action of such
     Governmental Authority; (ii) the Three Rivers stockholders fail to adopt
     this Agreement at the Three Rivers Meeting; or (iii) any of the closing

                                       46

<PAGE>

          conditions have not been met as required by Article VII hereof.

               (e)  Sky Common Stock. By Three Rivers, in the event that:

                    (i)  the Average NMS Closing Price (as defined below) of Sky
          Common Stock is less than $20.56; and
                                            ---

                    (ii) (A) the number obtained by dividing the Average NMS
          Closing Price of Sky Common Stock by $22.84 is less than (B) the
          number obtained by dividing the Final Index Price (as defined below)
          by the Initial Index Price (as defined below) and then multiplying the
          quotient in this clause (ii)(B) by 0.85.

               For purposes of this Section 8.01(e), the following terms have
          the meanings indicated below:

                    "Average NMS Closing Price" shall mean the arithmetic mean
          of the NMS Closing Prices for the ten trading days immediately
          preceding the fifth trading day prior to the receipt of final federal
          regulatory approval of the Merger.

                    "Final Index Price" means the sum of the Final Prices for
          each company comprising the Index Group multiplied by the appropriate
          weight.

                    "Final Price," with respect to any company belonging to the
          Index Group, means the arithmetic mean of the daily closing sales
          prices of a share of common stock of such company, as reported on the
          consolidated transaction reporting system for the market or exchange
          on which such common stock is principally traded, for the same ten
          trading days used in calculating the Average NMS Closing Price of Sky
          Common Stock (i.e., the valuation date).

                    "Index Group" means the 24 financial institutions holding
          companies listed on Exhibit B attached hereto, the common stock of all
          of which shall be publicly traded and as to which there shall not have
          been a publicly announced proposal at any time during the period
          beginning on the date of the Agreement and ending on the valuation
          date for any such company to be acquired. In the event that the common
          stock of any such company ceases to be publicly traded or a proposal
          to acquire any such company is announced at any time during the period
          beginning on the date of this Agreement and ending on the valuation
          date, such company will be removed from the Index Group, and the
          weights attributed to the remaining companies will be adjusted
          proportionately for purposes of determining the Final Index Price and
          the Initial Index Price. The 24 financial institution holding
          companies and the weights attributed to them are listed on Exhibit B.

                    "Initial Index Price" means the sum of each per share
          closing price of the common stock of each company comprising the Index
          Group multiplied by the applicable weighting, as such prices are
          reported on the consolidated transactions reporting system for the
          market or exchange on which such common stock is principally traded,
          on the trading day immediately preceding the public announcement of
          the Agreement.

                    "NMS Closing Price" shall mean the price per share of the
          last sale of Sky

                                       47

          Common Stock reported on the NASDAQ National Market System at the
          close of the trading day by the NASD.

                    Prior to Three Rivers exercising its right of termination
          under this Section 8.01(e), in the event that both of the conditions
          specified in Sections 8.01(e)(i) and (ii) are met, Sky may, at its
          option (the "Fill Option"), for a period of ten business days
          commencing on the date the parties determine the conditions have been
          met, offer to distribute to Three Rivers' stockholders, in connection
          with the Merger Consideration, the number of shares of Sky Common
          Stock or cash necessary for the Stock Exchange Ratio to equal $16.45
          divided by the Average NMS Closing Price of Sky Common Stock (the
          "Fill Offer"). Thereafter, for a period of ten business days, Three
          Rivers shall have the opportunity to accept or reject the Fill Offer.
          If Three Rivers elects to accept the Fill Offer, Three Rivers shall
          provide written notice of its acceptance to Sky, whereupon no
          termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 8.01(e) and
          this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms,
          except that the Merger Consideration shall have been so increased and
          any references in this Agreement to "Merger Consideration" and "Stock
          Exchange Ratio" shall thereafter be deemed to refer to the Merger
          Consideration and Stock Exchange Ratio after giving effect to any
          adjustment made pursuant to this Section 8.01(e). If Three Rivers
          rejects the Fill Offer, Three Rivers may terminate this Agreement in
          accordance with the provisions hereof. In the event Sky determines not
          to exercise the Fill Option, it will so advise Three Rivers in
          writing, and thereafter, for a period of three business days Three
          Rivers may exercise its right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
          this Section 8.01(e).

                    If Sky or any company belonging to the Index Group declares
          or effects a stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization,
          split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction
          between the date of the Agreement and the valuation date, the prices
          for the common stock of such company will be appropriately adjusted.

          8.02 Effect of Termination and Abandonment; Enforcement of Agreement.
In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger
pursuant to this Article VIII, no party to this Agreement shall have any
liability or further obligation to any other party hereunder except (i) as set
forth in Sections 8.03 and 9.01; and (ii) that termination will not relieve a
breaching party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement giving
rise to such termination. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, the parties hereto agree that irreparable damage will occur in the
event that a party breaches any of its obligations, duties, covenants and
agreements contained herein. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
of this Agreement in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled by law or in equity.

          8.03  Termination Fee. Three Rivers shall pay to Sky a termination fee
in the amount of $4,500,000 if:

                (i)  this Agreement is terminated by Sky pursuant to Section
          8.01(b)(ii) or by Sky or Three Rivers pursuant to Section 8.01(d)(ii);
          and prior to such termination, an

                                       48

<PAGE>

          Acquisition Proposal with respect to Three Rivers was commenced,
          publicly proposed or publicly disclosed; and within 18 months after
          such termination, Three Rivers shall have entered into an agreement
          relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any Acquisition Proposal shall
          have been consummated; or
                                 --

               (ii) after receiving an Acquisition Proposal, the Three Rivers
          Board does not take action to convene the Three Rivers Meeting and
          recommend that Three Rivers stockholders adopt this Agreement; and
          within 18 months after such receipt, Three Rivers shall have entered
          into an agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any
          Acquisition Proposal shall have been consummated.

               Upon payment of the fee described in this Section 8.03, Three
          Rivers shall have no further liability to Sky at law or in equity with
          respect to such termination under Section 8.01(b)(ii) or 8.01(d)(ii),
          or with respect to the Three Rivers Board's failure to take action to
          convene the Three Rivers Meeting and recommend that Three Rivers
          stockholders adopt this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                    ----------------------------------------

                               _____________, 2002

Sky Financial Group, Inc.
221 South Church Street
Bowling Green, Ohio 43402

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     I have been advised that as of the date hereof I may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" of Three Rivers Bancorp, Inc. ("Three Rivers"), as that term is
defined for purposes of Paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the Rules and
Regulations (the "Rules and Regulations") of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "Commission") promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the "Act").

     Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and between
Sky Financial Group, Inc. ("Sky Financial") and Three Rivers dated as of May
___, 2002 (the "Merger Agreement"), providing for the merger of Three Rivers
with and into Sky Financial (the "Merger"), and as a result of the Merger, I may
receive shares of Sky Financial common stock ("Sky Financial Common Shares") in
exchange for Three Rivers common shares ("Three Rivers Stock") owned by me at
the Effective Time (as defined and determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement).
This letter is being delivered pursuant to Section 6.07 of the Merger Agreement.
I represent and warrant to Sky Financial that in such event:

     A.   I will not sell, assign or transfer the Sky Financial Common Shares
which I receive as aforesaid in violation of the Act or the Rules and
Regulations.

     B.   I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and have
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of the Sky Financial Common Shares, to the
extent I feel necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Three Rivers. I
understand that Sky Financial is relying on the representations I am making in
this letter and I hereby agree to hold harmless and indemnify Sky Financial and
its officers and directors from and against any losses, claims, damages,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), or liabilities ("Losses") to
which Sky Financial or any officer or director of Sky Financial may become
subject under the Act or otherwise as a result of the untruth, breach, or
failure of such representations.

                                      A-1

__________, 2002

     C. I have been advised that the issuance of the Sky Financial Common Shares
issued to me pursuant to the Merger will have been registered with the
Commission under the Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I
have also been advised that since I may be deemed to be an affiliate under the
Rules and Regulations at the time the Merger was submitted for a vote of the
shareholders of Three Rivers, that the Sky Financial Common Shares must be held
by me indefinitely unless (i) my subsequent distribution of Sky Financial Common
Shares has been registered under the Act; (ii) a sale of the Sky Financial
Common Shares is made in conformity with the volume and other applicable
limitations of a transaction permitted by Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission
under the Act and as to which Sky Financial has received satisfactory evidence
of the compliance and conformity with said Rule, or (iii) a transaction in
which, in the opinion of Squire, Sanders & Dempsey L.L.P. (or other counsel
reasonably acceptable to Sky Financial) or in accordance with a no-action letter
from the Commission, some other exemption from registration is available with
respect to any such proposed sale, transfer or other disposition of the Sky
Financial Common Shares.

     D. I also understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Sky
Financial's transfer agent with respect to any Sky Financial Common Shares which
I receive in the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates for
such Sky Financial Common Shares, a legend stating in substance:

            "The shares represented by this certificate have been
        issued or transferred to the registered holder as a result of
        a transaction to which Rule 145 under the Securities Act of
        1933, as amended (the "Act"), applies. The shares represented
        by this certificate may not be sold, transferred or assigned,
        and the issuer shall not be required to give effect to any
        attempted sale, transfer or assignment, except pursuant to (i)
        an effective registration statement under the Act, (ii) a
        transaction permitted by Rule 145 and as to which the issuer
        has received reasonable and satisfactory evidence of
        compliance with the provisions of Rule 145, or (iii) a
        transaction in which, in the opinion of Squire, Sanders &
        Dempsey L.L.P. or other counsel satisfactory to the issuer or
        in accordance with a "no action" letter from the staff of the
        Securities and Exchange Commission, such shares are not
        required to be registered under the Act."

                                       A-2

     It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph D above
shall be removed and any stop order instructions with respect thereto shall be
canceled upon receipt of advice from Squire, Sanders & Dempsey L.L.P. or other
counsel satisfactory to Sky Financial that such actions are appropriate under
the then-existing circumstances.

                                        Very truly yours,
