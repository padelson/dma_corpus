the Effective Time, but subject to Buyer's agreement to pay any Taxes that are
prorated to Buyer pursuant to Section 13.3 and Buyer's portion of any
Transfer Taxes pursuant to Section 13.2;

2.4 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) _Estimated Working Capital_. At least five Business Days prior
to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer Seller's determination of
the Estimated Working Capital. At the request of Buyer, representatives of
Seller shall be available to answer questions with respect to the
determination of the Estimated Working Capital. Seller and Buyer shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any disputes with respect to the Estimated
Working Capital. At Closing:

  



  

(i) if the Estimated Working Capital is less than $12,273,000 (the "
_Working Capital Target Amount_ "), the Closing Payment shall be reduced by
an amount equal to such deficiency;

  



  

(ii) if the Estimated Working Capital exceeds the Working Capital
Target Amount, the Closing Payment shall be increased by an amount equal to
such excess; and

  



  

(iii) if the Estimated Working Capital equals the Working Capital
Target Amount, the Closing Payment shall not be adjusted.

  



  

(b) _Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement_. As soon as
practicable, and in any event within 90 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare, or shall cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller and
Parent, a statement of carve-out current assets and current liabilities
reflecting the Acquired Assets (and no other assets of Seller) and the Assumed
Obligations (and no other liabilities of Seller) determined as of the
Effective Time (the " _Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement_ ")
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that used
in the preparation of the Financial Statements and in a manner consistent
with _Exhibit B_. The Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be
accompanied by Buyer's calculation of each component of the amount of the Net
Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the " _Final Working Capital_ "). The
Final Working Capital shall be determined in accordance with the methodology
set forth in _Exhibit B_. During the 30-Business Day period from and after
delivery of the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement, Buyer shall
permit Seller and Parent and their accountants to review, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance written notice, the relevant
portions of work papers and other documents that are reasonably necessary for
Seller's and Parent's review of Buyer's calculation of the Final Working
Capital.

  



  

(c) _Disputes Regarding Final Closing Date Working Capital
Statement_. Seller shall have 30 Business Days after the date Buyer delivers
the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement (the " _Dispute Period_ ")
to dispute any of the elements of, or amounts reflected on, the Final Closing
Date Working Capital Statement and affecting the calculation of the Final
Working Capital (a " _Dispute_ "). If Seller does not give written notice to
Buyer of a Dispute (a " _Dispute Notice_ ") within the Dispute Period, the
Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be deemed accepted and
agreed to by Seller in the form in which it was delivered, and the Final
Working Capital set forth therein shall be final and binding upon the parties
hereto. If Seller has a Dispute, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a Dispute
Notice within the Dispute Period, setting forth, in reasonable detail, the
elements and amounts with which it disagrees and the reasons therefor. During
the 30-day period following delivery of the Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts in good faith to resolve the Dispute
and agree in writing upon the final content of the disputed Final Closing
Date Working Capital Statement. If Buyer and Seller agree as to the content of
the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement within such 30-day period,
the Final Working Capital as so agreed shall be final and binding upon the
Parties.

(d) _Dispute Resolution_. If Buyer and Seller are unable to resolve
any Dispute within the 30-day period after Seller delivers a Dispute Notice,
Buyer and Seller shall jointly engage the Houston, Texas office of BDO Seidman
LLP (the " _Arbitrating Accountant_ ") as arbitrator to promptly resolve any
Disputes under the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement, or if such
firm declines, such other nationally recognized accounting firm as is
reasonably acceptable to the Parties. In connection with the resolution of
any Dispute, the Arbitrating Accountant shall have access to all documents,
records, work papers, facilities and personnel necessary to perform its
function as arbitrator. The Arbitrating Accountant's function shall be to
conform the Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement and the Final
Working Capital to the requirements of this Section 2.4. The Arbitrating
Accountant shall allow Buyer and Seller (or Parent) to present their
respective positions regarding the Dispute. The Arbitrating Accountant may, at
its discretion, conduct a conference concerning the Dispute, at which
conference each of Buyer and Seller (or Parent) shall have the right to
present additional documents, materials and other information and to have
present its advisors, counsel and accountants. In connection with such
process, there shall be no other hearings or any oral examinations, testimony,
depositions, discovery or other similar proceedings. The Arbitrating
Accountant shall thereafter promptly render its decision (based solely on the
presentations by the Buyer and Seller and not by independent review, and in
accordance with GAAP applied on a basis consistent with that used in the
preparation of the Financial Statements and in a manner consistent with
_Exhibit B_ ) only on the items in dispute and shall render a written report
as to the Arbitrating Accountant's resolution of such disputed items,
including reasons for such resolution(s), and finalize the Final Closing Date
Working Capital Statement. For purposes of the Arbitrating
Accountant's determination, the amounts to be included shall be the
appropriate amounts from the Final Closing Date Working Capital
Statement with respect to items that are not in dispute, and the amounts
determined by the Arbitrating Accountant, with respect to items that are
submitted for resolution by the Arbitrating Accountant. In resolving any
disputed item, the Arbitrating Accountant may not assign a value to such item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party in the
Final Closing Date Working Capital Statement or Dispute Notice or less than
the lowest value for such item claimed by either party in the Final
Closing Date Working Capital Statement or Dispute Notice. Such written
determination shall be final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment may
be entered on the award. Upon the resolution of all Disputes, the Final
Closing Date Working Capital Statement shall be revised to reflect the
resolution and the Net Working Capital amount set forth thereon and shall be
treated as the Final Working Capital. The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountant shall be allocated between Seller and Buyer so that
Seller's share of such fees and expenses shall be equal to the product of (i)
the aggregate amount of such fees and expenses, multiplied by (ii) a
fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute that is ultimately
unsuccessfully disputed by Seller, and the denominator of which is the total
value in dispute. The date on which the Final Working Capital is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall hereinafter be referred to as
the " _Adjustment Settlement Date_."

(e) Final Working Capital Adjustment.

  



  

(i) If the Final Working Capital Amount is greater than the
Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer shall pay to Seller the amount of
such excess;

  



  

(ii) If the Final Working Capital Amount is less than the Estimated
Working Capital, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such
difference; or

  



  

(iii) If the Final Working Capital Amount is equal to the Estimated
Working Capital Amount, then no adjustment shall be made.

  



  

Any payments required under this Section 2.4(e) shall be effected within two
Business Days after the Adjustment Settlement Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account or accounts specified by the
receiving Party.

  



  

2.5 _Employee Adjustment_. The Purchase Price shall be adjusted
downward at Closing by an amount equal to the product of (i) $1,000,
_multiplied by_ (ii) the number of Employees that, as of the date on which
Seller delivers to Buyer its determination of the Estimated Working Capital
pursuant to Section 2.4(a), Seller employs in the job categories described on
_Schedule 2.5_. Seller shall deliver to Buyer concurrently with delivery of
its determination of the Estimated Working Capital a list of all such
Employees, which shall be used for determining the adjustment provided for in
this Section 2.5.

  



  

2.6 _Allocation of Purchase Price_. Seller and Buyer shall use
good faith efforts to attempt to reach agreement on the allocation of
the applicable portion of the Purchase Price and other relevant items
(including, for example, adjustments to the Purchase Price) among the
Acquired Assets, including goodwill and other assets, within 90 days of the
Closing Date, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder and any comparable provision of state,
local or foreign law, as appropriate (the " _Allocation_ "). If Seller and
Buyer reach a timely agreement regarding the Allocation, (a) such
Allocation shall be binding on the Parties, (b) the Parties shall prepare and
timely file all applicable federal and state income Tax forms (including
Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the
Allocation, cooperate with each other in the preparation of such forms, and
furnish each other with a copy of the final version of Form 8594 within a
reasonable period before the filing date thereof, and (c) except as otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code (or any comparable provision of any state, local or
foreign law), none of the Parties shall take, and each shall cause its
Affiliates not to take, a position inconsistent with the Allocation on any Tax
Return (including any forms required to be filed pursuant to Section 1060 of
the Code), or otherwise. The Parties recognize that the Allocation will not
include Buyer's acquisition expenses or Seller's selling expenses, and Seller
and Buyer will unilaterally allocate such expenses appropriately. If
the Parties are unable to reach a timely agreement regarding the Allocation,
each party shall be entitled to adopt its own position regarding the
Allocation.

(e) _Schedule 3.15(e)_ sets forth a list of each Employee Benefit
Plan that covers any Employee that is intended to meet the

are qualified and exempt from U.S. federal income taxes under Sections 401(a)
and 501(a) of the Code, respectively, and nothing has occurred that would
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualification of such plans or
related trusts.

  



  

(f) Except for certain retention payments due to certain Employees
on the Closing Date, which are payable by Parent, and other than with
respect to any Employee who does not accept employment from Buyer, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
contemplated transactions could, either alone or in combination with another
event, (i) entitle any Employee to any separation, severance, termination or
similar benefits or any increase in severance pay, or (ii) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any such
Employee.

  



  

(g) _Schedule 3.15(g)_ identifies all former Employees of Seller
who have suffered an employment loss within the meaning of the WARN Act

for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2012 and balance sheet of Seller as
of March 31, 2012, together with the audit opinion thereon of the Auditor

have been prepared in accordance with GAAP (except as otherwise indicated on
_Schedule 3.17(a)_ ), and present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of the Seller and the results of its operations in
accordance with GAAP as of and for the dates and periods identified in the
Financial Statements, each of which is subject to the limitations and
qualifications set forth therein and in the notes, presentation qualifications
and assumptions thereto, except that the Interim Financial Statements are
subject to normal fiscal year-end adjustments and accruals in connection with
the preparation of annual audited financial statements, none of which would
be material; provided, however, that Seller makes no representation
concerning the audit and review process of Auditor or its audit opinion. The
Financial Statements have been prepared in a manner meeting the requirements
of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission, and

assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management's
general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to assets is

Seller's Knowledge, does there exist any event or circumstance, with the
giving of notice or passing of time, that would result in an event of default

(c) To the Seller's Knowledge, to the extent that any Intellectual
Property owned by Seller for use in the conduct of the Business (other than
Intellectual Property __ licensed by Seller) has been developed, created,
conceived or reduced to practice by any employee, consultant or independent
contractor of Seller for the benefit of Seller, such Person has executed an
agreement under which all rights, title and ownership in and to such

(vii) make any material change to its accounting procedures or

omission;

  



  

(ix) enter into any collective bargaining agreement covering any of
the Employees;

5.2 _Further Assurances_. Buyer and Seller agree:

  



  

(a) until the Closing, Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially
reasonable good faith efforts to perform and fulfill all conditions and
obligations to be fulfilled or performed by them hereunder, to the end that
the transactions contemplated hereby will be fully and timely consummated;

  



  

(b) if any event should occur, within the knowledge and control of
such Party, that would prevent fulfillment of the conditions to
the obligations of any Party hereto to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement that are to be satisfied by such Party, to use
its or their reasonable efforts to cure the same as expeditiously as possible;
and

  



  

(c) to execute and deliver such documents or instruments, in form
reasonably acceptable to the Party requesting the same and its counsel, as
may be reasonably necessary to carry out and/or to comply with the terms of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein.

  



  

5.3 _Access_. From and after the date hereof and through the
Closing Date, Seller shall give Buyer and Buyer's Representatives
reasonable access, upon reasonable notice and at mutually agreeable times, to
(i) the Acquired Assets, the Business and Seller's executive management team,
and (ii) through Seller's executive management team, other Employees, in order
that Buyer may have the opportunity to make such examination and
investigation as it may reasonably request, including for purposes of
qualifying, making offers to, and processing of Employees who satisfy Buyer's
employment requirements and pre-hiring process as provided in Section
5.6. Buyer's access shall not unreasonably interfere with Seller's continuing
operation of the Business and shall be subject to Seller's customary safety
and security policies. Seller shall furnish Buyer's Representatives during
such period with such information in Seller's possession or control as such
Representatives may reasonably request concerning the Acquired Assets and the
Business; _provided_ _however_ , that Buyer and Buyer's Representatives shall
hold the documents and information concerning Seller, the Acquired Assets and
the Business confidential in accordance with Section 5.8 hereof.

  



  

5.4 _Keeping of Books and Records; Financial Statements_.

  



  

(a) From and after the date hereof and through the Closing Date,
Seller shall keep records and books of account with respect to the

--- 

    



  

(b) Without limiting any other obligation hereunder, through the
ninetieth day following the Closing Date, Seller shall and shall cause
its Affiliates to, and shall request the Auditor to, provide Equifax and its
Representatives such customary and reasonable information, documents and
assistance as is reasonably requested by Equifax in connection with the
preparation of any filings under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act to
the extent such filings relate to the Business or Seller, including in the
preparation of pro forma financial statements that reflect the effect of the
acquisition by Buyer of the Business with respect to the historical
accounting periods reflected in the Financial Statements (and, if applicable,
the December Financial Statements), and in connection with
Equifax's arrangement at or prior to the Closing of any senior note offering
or other financing by Equifax in connection with its funding of Buyer's
purchase of the Acquired Assets hereunder (it being understood that such
financing is not a condition to such Closing), and Seller shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to secure from the Auditor its review of
Seller's carve-out financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2012
currently in progress on the schedule agreed by the Auditor, and
subsequently to have the Auditor provide a customary "comfort letter" in
connection with a senior note offering by Equifax. In connection with
Equifax's valuation of certain intangibles included in the Acquired Assets,
Seller shall also provide reasonable assistance to Equifax and any third
party appraiser Equifax retains to provide such valuation, to the extent of
information reasonably within the possession or control of Seller and to the
extent that such valuation is reasonably required to be conducted or commenced
prior to the Closing. Buyer agrees to reimburse Seller for any fees of the
Auditor or other third party fees or expenses reasonably incurred by Seller
or its Affiliates in connection with providing assistance pursuant to this
Section 5.4(b). Any assistance provided by Seller or an Affiliate thereof
shall be provided during normal working hours on Business Days. Neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates shall be responsible for the failure of Auditor to
complete its review of the financial statements for the quarter ended
March 31, 2012 or to provide any "comfort letter" on any financial
statements.

  



  

(c) If the Termination Date is extended pursuant to Section 12.1(b),
and if the Parties reasonably determine that the Closing will or may occur
after February 1, 2013, then on a date to be mutually agreed on by the
Parties, Seller shall commence preparation of an unaudited carve out balance
sheet of the Seller as of December 31, 2012, together with unaudited carve-out
statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows of the
Seller for the nine month period ended December 31, 2012 (collectively,
the "December Financial Statements"), and shall engage the Auditor (or such
other independent accounting firm as the Parties may agree) to conduct a
review of such carve-out financial statements. The December Financial
Statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP and present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Business and the results
of its operations in accordance with GAAP as of and for the dates and periods
identified in the December Financial Statements, subject to the
limitations and qualifications set forth therein and in the notes,
presentation qualifications and assumptions thereto, and except that
the December Financial Statements are subject to normal fiscal year-end
adjustments and accruals in connection with the preparation of annual audited
financial statements, none of which will be material, and shall be prepared in
a manner meeting the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, and shall be suitable for inclusion in a
Current Report on Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, provided such Current Report is filed prior to the date on
which the December Financial Statements are no longer deemed current under
the applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and
Exchange Commission. The costs and expenses associated with the engagement of
the Auditor (or such other independent accounting firm as the Parties may
agree), to review the December Financial Statements as well as the preparation
of the December Financial Statements shall be borne equally by Seller and
Buyer. The December Financial Statements shall be prepared by Seller as soon
as reasonably practicable following the commencement of the preparation
thereof. The Auditor's engagement letter in connection with its review of the
December Financial Statements will specify the timing of the completion of the
Auditor's review thereof, which shall be specified in consultation among
Seller, Buyer and the Auditor. Neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall
be responsible for the failure of Auditor (or such other accounting firm as
the Parties may agree) to complete its review of the December Financial
Statements.

5.5 _Litigation_. From and after the date hereof and through the
Closing Date, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of any Actions relating to
the Business or any Acquired Asset, or to Seller in connection with the
Business or any Acquired Asset, that are served on Seller or, to Seller's
Knowledge, threatened or anticipated against or by Seller.

  



  

5.6 _Employees_.

  



  

(a) At the time of Closing, Buyer shall, subject to such Employees
satisfying Buyer's standard employment requirements and pre-hiring process to
the extent Buyer determines to apply the same prior to Closing, (i) offer
employment to each actively at work Employee, and specifically including any
Employees on leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, effective
as of the Closing Date in a role with a level of responsibility and with
compensation levels (including base salary and target bonus) which, when
taken as a whole, are at least reasonably comparable to the aggregate levels
each Employee had in effect with Seller as of the date of this Agreement, and
(ii) effective as of the first day of the month coincident with or following
the Closing Date, provide to each Transferred Employee employment benefits
(other than any defined benefit pension plan benefits, deferred compensation
plan benefits, severance benefits and any equity compensation benefits) that
are either (A) reasonably comparable in the aggregate to those benefits
provided to newly hired employees of Buyer in comparable positions, which
benefits shall include medical coverage, or (B) reasonably comparable in the
aggregate to those benefits received by the applicable Employee from Seller
immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding any enhancements to
such benefits made after the date hereof. The Transferred Employees
shall continue to participate in Seller's Employee Benefit Plans identified
on _Schedule 5.6(a)(i)_ through the last day of the calendar month in which
the Closing occurs (or if earlier, the date the Transferred Employee
terminates employment with Buyer and its Affiliates), and Buyer shall
reimburse Seller for the cost of such continued participation, in accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth in _Schedule 5.6(a)(ii)_. Prior to
the Closing Seller will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
confirmation from The Hartford that after the Closing The Hartford will honor
the conversion rights of each Transferred Employee and covered dependents
applicable to terminated Employees and their dependents under Seller's
supplemental, dependent and spousal life and ADandD insurance policy and will
not terminate such policy during the applicable conversion period
following Closing.

  



   

41

(b) If Buyer terminates any Transferred Employee within 90 days
following the Closing Date other than for cause, Buyer shall provide
such Transferred Employee with severance benefits no less than the benefits
that would be provided under Seller's Reduction in Force policy effective
June 19, 2012. Nothing in this Agreement limits the rights of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates to eliminate or change the conditions of employment, including
the amendment or termination of any benefit plans, for any reason as Buyer
may, in its sole discretion, unilaterally determine. Seller shall be
responsible for termination of any existing employment agreements, severance
payments, pension or other employment and employee benefit plan obligations
related to past service for all Employees, whether or not offered employment
by Buyer. Seller shall prior to the Closing provide Buyer with a schedule of
all former Employees who have suffered an employment loss within the meaning
of the WARN Act at any time on or within the ninety (90) days prior to the
Closing Date. Seller shall be responsible for any obligations under the WARN
Act with respect to any employment by Seller or failure by Seller to employ
or continue to employ any Employees through the Closing Date or with respect
to the failure of any Employee to receive an offer of employment from Buyer
because such Employee failed to satisfy Buyer's standard
employment requirements and pre-hiring process. Buyer shall be responsible
for any obligations under the WARN Act with respect to any failure by Buyer
to offer employment to any Employee who satisfied Buyer's standard employment
requirements and pre-hiring process (a " _Qualified Employee_ ") and any
failure to continue to employ any Transferred Employees following the
Closing Date (including, if applicable, for WARN Act obligations applicable
to Employees terminated by Seller on or before the Closing Date and
identified in writing to Buyer on or before the Closing Date to the extent
Buyer's failure to offer employment to Qualified Employees or failure to
continue to employ Transferred Employees results in such WARN Act obligation
for such Seller-terminated Employee); provided, that if Buyer determines that
an event would trigger obligations arising under the WARN Act, or any
similar foreign, state or local Legal Requirement relative to any plant
closing or mass layoff (or similar triggering event) within sixty (60) days
following the Closing Date, Seller shall, at Buyer's request and at Buyer's
expense, provide notices to all employees required to be provided under the
WARN Act (or any similar Legal Requirement), in a form approved by and as
directed by Buyer.

  



   

42

(c) Buyer agrees that in connection with its employment of any such
Transferred Employees, Buyer shall: (i) give full credit for years of service
with Seller or its predecessors for purposes of (A) eligibility to participate
in and vesting under Buyer's 401(k) plan and (B) determining seniority and
other terms and conditions of employment, termination and severance, including
vacation but excluding any grandfathered benefits requiring employment as of
a date prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) will apply prior period(s) of
health insurance coverage toward satisfaction of Buyer's pre-existing
conditions limitations upon submission of Certificate(s) of Creditable
Coverage, as permitted under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996. If, for any reason the Closing Date occurs after
December 31, 2012, to the extent permissible under Buyer's plans, (i)
Buyer shall cause all previously met medical and dental plan deductibles
incurred under Seller's medical and dental plans during the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs to be applied toward Buyer's preferred access
medical plan and Buyer's dental plan deductibles for such calendar year, and
(ii) previous out-of-pocket medical expenses met under Seller's plan during
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs will apply toward Buyer's
out-of -pocket protection maximums for such calendar year. From the date
hereof until the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with reasonable access to
the Employees during normal business hours upon reasonable notice. Such
access shall be in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and for the
purpose of interviewing such persons and establishing the satisfaction of
Buyer's standard employment requirements and pre-hiring process, to the
extent Buyer determines to apply the same prior to Closing. Buyer and Seller
shall consult with each other regarding communication with the Employees in
an effort to minimize any adverse impact on the Business. Nothing in
this Agreement shall confer upon any Employee any right with respect to
employment by Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing references to "Buyer", it
is agreed by Seller and Buyer that the obligation of Buyer to offer employment
in accordance with the terms and conditions described in this Section 5.6 can
be satisfied by Buyer or any other Affiliate or Affiliates of Buyer,
as determined in the sole discretion of Buyer, and if satisfied by one or
more Affiliates of Buyer, all references to Buyer includes such Affiliates.

  



  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, Employees participate in the
defined contribution plan listed on _Schedule 5.6(d)_ (the " _CSC 401(k)
Plan_ "). Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall amend the CSC 401(k) Plan
and take any other action necessary so that the account balances of the
Employees shall be fully vested and may, at the election of each such Employee
made within 30 days of the Closing Date, be transferred to a tax qualified
defined contribution plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates. Buyer
shall take all necessary action so that a tax qualified defined contribution
plan maintained by Buyer accepts the transfer of such account balances in
cash (excluding loans) of the electing Employees.

  



  

5.7 _Consents_.

  



  

(a) _Required Consents_. For any Assigned Contract or Permit the
transfer of which would require a Consent, Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and Buyer shall provide commercially
reasonable cooperation to Seller, to obtain all Consents required to
effect assignment thereof to Buyer as of the Closing Date. If Seller is
unable to obtain the requisite Consent to assignment of any Assigned Contract
or Permit prior to the Closing Date and the Closing is consummated, Seller
shall continue to use its commercially reasonable and necessary actions, and
Buyer shall continue to provide commercially reasonable cooperation to Seller,
required to (i) assign to Buyer such Assigned Contract or Permit or (ii) to
facilitate the replacement of such Assigned Contract with a new contract
entered into directly between Buyer and the applicable third party, in each
case as soon as reasonably practicable. For the avoidance of doubt, only the
Consents to the Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.7_ shall be conditions to
Closing.

  



   

43 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) _Contracts Without Consent_. If any Consent required to effect
assignment of an Assigned Contract to Buyer without breach or
violation thereof is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, without limiting
the terms of Section 5.7(a) with respect to the Assigned Contract to which
the Consent relates, such Assigned Contract shall not be deemed assigned to
Buyer at Closing to the extent necessary to avoid such breach or violation,
and pending obtaining the Consent to such assignment, the Parties shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to implement a reasonable
arrangement designed to afford to Buyer all of the economic and operational
benefits and burdens of the affected Assigned Contract (but only such
economic and operational benefits and burdens). Such arrangement may involve
Seller's involvement as the named party to the applicable Assigned Contract in
dealing with the counterparty to such Assigned Contract on behalf of Buyer on
a "pass-through" basis to facilitate Buyer obtaining such benefits. Upon
obtaining the required Consent to assignment of any Contract, the applicable
Contract shall be deemed automatically assigned to and assumed by Buyer.
Buyer and Seller shall execute and deliver such further documents and
instruments as either may reasonably request to evidence such assignment and
assumption.

  



  

(c) _Governmental Filings_. Buyer and Seller hereby covenant and
agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of any
Governmental Body necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
any objection, inquiry or investigation asserted by any Governmental Body
under any antitrust law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby,
if any. Buyer and Seller shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated hereby
and work cooperatively in connection with obtaining any consents from
Governmental Bodies, including (i) promptly notifying the other parties of
any material communications from or with any Governmental Body with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii)
furnishing the other parties with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other parties may reasonably request in
connection with its preparation of necessary filings or submissions
of information to any Governmental Body, in each case, with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall each pay
one-half of the filing fees relating to any filings made under the HSR Act in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. Nothing contained in
this Section 5.7(c), or in any other provision of this Agreement (including
Section 8.1) shall require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to agree to any
conditions or limitations on any asset, business or property of Buyer or any
of its Affiliates, on any asset, business or property of which Buyer or any of
its Affiliates has or hereafter has an unconsummated Contract to acquire or
to transfer or on the Acquired Assets, or agree to divest, hold separately, or
take any other action with respect to any asset, business or property.

5.8 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) _Buyer Confidentiality_.

  



  

(i) From and after the date hereof, except as required by applicable
Legal Requirements or permitted by Section 5.3, neither Buyer, nor any of its
Affiliates or their Representatives shall, at any time, make use of, divulge
or otherwise disclose, directly or indirectly, any Seller Proprietary
Information. For the avoidance of doubt, the confidentiality obligations of
Buyer under the Nondisclosure Agreement shall continue to apply to all
information of Seller to the extent provided therein, whether or not such
information is Seller Proprietary Information, prior to the Closing.

  



  

(ii) For the purposes of this Section 5.8(a), " _Seller Proprietary
Information_ " means any and all information regarding Seller, not relating
to the Acquired Assets and the Business, together with all information
relating to assets other than the Acquired Assets or the Retained Obligations
under this Agreement, which has not been or is not generally made available to
the public by Seller prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

(b) _Seller Confidentiality_.

  



  

(i) From and after the Closing, Seller will not, and Seller will
cause its Affiliates and its and their Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, use or disclose (other than to or on behalf of Buyer) any Buyer
Proprietary Information. This Section 5.8(b) shall survive the Closing and
shall continue indefinitely; provided, however, that the restrictions in this
Section 5.8(b) shall terminate on the fifth (5th) anniversary of the Closing
with respect to any Buyer Proprietary Information that does not then
constitute a trade secret under applicable Legal Requirements. Nothing in
this Section 5.8(b) shall be construed to limit or supersede the common law
of torts or statutory or other protection of trade secrets where such law
provides greater or longer protection than provided in this Section 5.8(b).

  



  

(ii) For purposes of this Section 5.8(b), " _Buyer Proprietary
Information_ " means any and all technical, business and other information of
or relating to the Business, any Acquired Asset, or Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives that derives value, actual, potential, economic
or otherwise, from not being generally known to other Persons, which is not
generally known to the public or to any other Person, including technical or
nontechnical data, compositions, devices, methods, techniques,
drawings, inventions, processes, machinery, financial data, financial plans,
product plans, lists concerning actual or potential customers or suppliers,
information regarding acquisition and investment plans and strategies,
business plans or operations, information created or developed for Buyer
under the Transition Services Agreement. Seller hereby confirms that after the
Closing the Buyer Proprietary Information includes all information and rights
to information that constitute an Acquired Asset.

  



   

45 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(c) This Section 5.8(a) and (b) shall apply unless such Seller
Proprietary Information or Buyer Proprietary Information (collectively, "
_Proprietary Information_ "): (i) is or becomes generally available and known
to the public without breach by Buyer, Seller, Parent or any of their
Affiliates or Representatives, as applicable (each, a " _Confidentiality
Party_ "), of any obligation to the other Party or any of their
Representatives or Affiliates under this Section 5.8; (ii) is rightfully
received by a Confidentiality Party from any Person, without restriction on
use or disclosure and without breach of any obligation hereunder; or (iii) is
independently developed by or for a Confidentiality Party without reference
to or use of Proprietary Information.

  



  

(d) If a Confidentiality Party is required by any court or
legislative or administrative body (by oral questions, interrogatories,
request for information or documents, subpoena or similar process) to
disclose any Proprietary Information of another Party, such
Confidentiality Party shall provide such other Party with prompt notice of
such requirement in order to afford such Party an opportunity to seek an
appropriate protective order. The Confidentiality Party shall cooperate with
the applicable Party in an effort to obtain such a protective order. However,
if a Party is unable to obtain or does not seek such a protective order, and a
Confidentiality Party is, in the opinion of counsel, compelled to disclose
the Proprietary Information under penalty of liability for contempt,
censure or other penalty, disclosure of such Proprietary Information may be
made without liability, but only to the extent that such
Confidentiality Party is so compelled to disclose the Proprietary Information
in response to such process.

  



  

(e) The Parties acknowledge that any breach of this Section 5.8
could result in irreparable harm that might not be adequately compensated by
damages, and expressly recognize each Party's right to immediate injunctive
relief in the event of the breach of this Section 5.8, in addition to any and
all other remedies and damages available to the Parties at law or in equity.

  



  

(f) That certain Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement between Buyer and
Parent, dated as of September 17, 2012 (the " _Nondisclosure Agreement_
"), shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, provided that
in the case of any inconsistency between the Nondisclosure Agreement and this
Agreement, this Agreement shall control. Seller agrees to be bound by the
Nondisclosure Agreement in the same manner as Parent, as though it were a
party thereto.

  



  

5.9 _Brokers Fees_. Seller shall be responsible for and shall pay
any financial advisory fee, brokerage commission, finder's fee, or like
payment payable to any broker, agent, advisors, or other Persons acting on
behalf of Seller or under their authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby. Buyer shall be responsible for any such similar fees
payable to any broker, agent, advisors or other Persons acting on behalf of
Buyer or under its authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

5.10 _Access to Books and Records and Personnel_. For a period of
seven years from the Closing Date (or such longer period as may be required
by any Governmental Body or requested by a Party in connection with disputes
or litigation):

  



  

(a) neither Party shall either dispose of or destroy any of the
books and records (other than records regarding the conduct of the
Business at times prior to seven years prior to the Closing Date) retained or
held by such Party relating to the ownership of the Acquired Assets by Seller
or the operation of the Business prior to Closing without first offering to
turn over possession thereof to the other Party, by written notice to the
other Party at least 30 days prior to the proposed date of such disposition or
destruction;

  



  

(b) each Party shall allow the other Party and its agents reasonable
access to such books and records during normal working hours at the offices
of such Party at which such books and records are located;

  



  

(c) each Party shall make available to the other Party upon written
request therefor (i) copies of any such books and records, (ii) its personnel
to assist the other Party in locating and obtaining any such books and
records, and (iii) any other assistance or participation reasonably required,
including access to personnel (including for depositions and/or court
appearances to the extent reasonably necessary), by a Party in connection
with existing or future litigation (including defense of Actions referred to
in Section 10.4), tax returns, audited and unaudited financial statements or
accounting reports or other matters in which such Party is involved, relating
to the operation of the Business prior to Closing, to the Acquired Assets or
to the Assumed Obligations or Retained Obligations, as applicable. The Party
so requesting shall reimburse the other Party for the reasonable costs and
expenses (excluding corporate overhead and salaries but including out of
pocket and third party costs and expenses) incurred by such Party in
performing the covenants contained in this Section 5.10; and

  



  

(d) each Party's access under this Section 5.10 shall not
unreasonably interfere with the continuing operations or business of
the other Party or its Affiliates and shall be subject to such Party and its
Affiliates' customary safety and security policies and shall be subject to
any legal privileges that may then be applicable.

  



  

5.11 _COBRA Compliance_. Seller agrees that on and after the
Effective Time and with respect to Employees through the Closing Date it will
satisfy all requirements regarding continuation of health benefit coverage
with respect to all applicable former Employees or other "MandA qualified
beneficiary" as defined in QandA-4 of Treas. Reg. § 54.4980B-9 (excluding
consultants), or the beneficiaries or dependents of such former Employees,
under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B(f) of the
Code (herein collectively referred to as " _COBRA_ "), including any notices
and continuation of health benefit coverage required to be provided on and
after the Effective Time to such former Employees or other MandA qualified
beneficiaries by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.12 _Updates to Disclosure Schedules_. Seller will notify Buyer in
writing of, and contemporaneously will provide Buyer with true and complete
copies of, any and all information or documents relating to any event,
transaction or circumstance, as soon as practicable after it becomes known to
Seller, occurring after the date of this Agreement that renders or will render
untrue any representation or warranty of Seller contained in this Agreement
as if the same were made on or as of the date of such event, transaction or
circumstance, in each case specifying with particularity the representation
and warranty affected in an updated Disclosure Schedule; provided, however,
that updates to the Disclosure Schedules shall only be permitted in connection
with such events, transactions or circumstances that occur after the date of
this Agreement. Any update given pursuant to this Section 5.12 shall be
disregarded for purposes of Section 7.1 and Section 10.1(i), except as
follows. If (i) the occurrence of the event, transaction or circumstance
reflected in any such update would cause any representation or warranty of
Seller contained in this Agreement to be untrue at Closing and (ii) if such
failure would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have an adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or
condition of Seller, the Acquired Assets or the Business, in an amount in
excess of 1% of the Purchase Price, Seller shall be entitled to confirm to
Buyer that as a result of the event, transaction or circumstance contained in
such update Buyer may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 12.1(e)_.
If Buyer does not exercise such right of termination prior to the Closing
pursuant to written notice to Seller to such effect, then such supplemental
disclosure shall modify the representation and warranty of Seller identified
in such update effective at and as of the Closing for purposes of
indemnification under Section 10.1(i) (but not for indemnification for any
such matters under any other section hereof). Seller may update _Schedule 3.7_
 to reflect Consumer Claims arising in the Ordinary Course of Business after
the date hereof, and such update shall be deemed to modify _Schedule 3.7_ as
of the Closing.

  



  

5.13 _Alternative Transactions_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date or earlier
termination hereof, Seller and Parent shall not, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
through any other Person, initiate, solicit, facilitate, induce or encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information or other assistance),
or enter into negotiations or discussions of any type, directly or
indirectly, or enter into a confidentiality agreement, letter of intent or
purchase agreement, merger agreement or other understanding or agreement with
any Person other than Buyer with respect to a sale of all or any portion
of the Acquired Assets, or a merger or consolidation involving Seller, or
other business combination, in each case in a transaction that includes any
portion of the Business or the Acquired Assets (an " _Alternative Transaction_
").

  



  

(b) Seller will immediately cease any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates)
conducted heretofore with respect to any Alternative Transaction, and will
request that all Persons, other than Buyer and its Affiliates, who have been
furnished confidential information regarding the Business in connection with
the solicitation of or discussions regarding an Alternative Transaction
within the 12 months prior to the date hereof promptly return or destroy such
information.

5.14 _Transfers of Cash Pre-Closing; Receipt of Cash Post-Closing_.
Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall remain free to maintain its current
cash management practices in the Ordinary Course of Business. Prior to the
close of business on the Business Day preceding the Closing Date, Seller
shall be entitled to distribute to Parent all cash balances contained in the
any lockboxes of Seller that will be transferred to Buyer as Acquired Assets.
If, at any time following the Closing, a Party or its Affiliates receives
any cash or other assets in respect of the Business to which any other Party
is entitled, such receiving Party will, and will cause its Affiliates to, as
promptly as practicable, deliver such cash or assets to the Party entitled
thereto.

  



  

5.15 _Performance Bonds_. Buyer shall (i) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to replace each Performance Bond outstanding and issued as
of the date hereof, with a bond, letter of credit, bank guarantee or other
instrument similar in nature to the instrument replaced, and (ii) cooperate
with Parent's efforts to obtain a release of each guarantee by Parent to the
benefit of a third party relating to an Assumed Obligation listed on
_Schedule 5.15_ (a " _Parent Guarantee_ "), including by providing a
replacement guarantee of like tenor to the replaced Parent Guarantee. For the
avoidance of doubt, (y) the replacement of any Performance Bond or release of
any Parent Guarantee is not a condition to either Party's obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, and (z) any Losses sustained
by Seller or Parent after Closing pursuant to a Performance Bond or Parent
Guarantee based on Buyer's failure to perform the Assumed Obligation related
thereto are subject to indemnification by Buyer pursuant to Section
10.2(iii). In connection with the Seller's requirement under Section 7.3 to
obtain the consent of the landlord under that certain Office Lease, dated
September 14, 2001, as amended, between Koll Bren Fund V, L.P. and Seller,
relating to 652 N. Sam Houston Parkway E., Houston, Texas 77060, which Office
Lease is guaranteed by Parent, Buyer shall cause Equifax to provide a
substitute guaranty in favor of such landlord to replace Parent's guaranty as
of the Effective Time.

  



  

5.16 _Accounts Receivable Procedures_. From and after the Effective
Time, Buyer shall invoice and pursue collection of the Accounts Receivable in
the Ordinary Course of Business using not less than the same level of efforts
Buyer uses in the collection of accounts receivable generally in its own
business. For a period of nine months after the Closing, and solely for
purposes of determining the amount of any indemnification claims under
Section 10.1(i) with respect to Breaches of the representations and warranties
in Section 3.5, in circumstances where (a) (i) a single Person is an account
debtor on more than one Accounts Receivable and/or accounts, notes or loans
receivable that are not Accounts Receivable and (ii) such account debtor makes
a single lump sum payment on such receivables without identifying
specifically to which receivables such payment relates, such payments first
shall be allocated to satisfy in full all then outstanding Accounts
Receivable in order of the dates such receivables were billed or (b) less than
the full amount of an Accounts Receivable shall have been paid by the account
debtor, any such payment received shall be credited only to such Accounts
Receivable. From and after the Effective Time, if Buyer shall receive payment
on any Accounts Receivable for which Buyer or any Affiliate or Representative
of Buyer had previously been indemnified and actually paid by the Seller
pursuant to Section 10.1(i) based on a Breach of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.5, then Buyer shall promptly remit the full amount of
such payment (net of any direct costs and expenses incurred by Buyer in
connection with the receipt of such payment) to Seller without any deduction
or offset whatsoever. Buyer shall not agree to settle any Closing Date Account
Receivable for less than the full amount thereof for which Seller might have
an indemnification obligation hereunder without the prior consent of Seller
(not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

5.17 _Patent Rights_. Seller covenants to cause the Parent Entities
not to sue the Subsidiary of Equifax that owns the Business after the Closing
Date for any claim that such Subsidiary's activities after the Closing Date in
conducting the Business after the Closing Date in the manner conducted by
Seller prior to the Closing Date, and directly traceable to Seller, infringe
patent rights owned by any Parent Entity before the Closing Date and having a
priority date before the Closing Date, if and to the extent that such
activities are substantially the same as Seller's activities in conducting the
Business before the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt in the
interpretation of this Section 5.17, Seller's activities conducted before the
Closing Date shall not be deemed to have been modified to include any
activities that may be conducted after the Closing Date by the Subsidiary of
Equifax that owns the Business after the Closing Date to the extent of any
services that may be provided by any Parent Entity to such Subsidiary and the
Business pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, and this covenant not
to sue shall not apply to any patent rights previously not used by Seller in
the Business prior to the Closing Date even if the patent rights are used by
any Parent Entity during the provision of services to such Subidiary and the
Business under the Transition Services Agreement. In addition, this covenant
not to sue shall not apply to Equifax, Buyer or any Subsidiary or Affiliate of
Equifax with respect to any activities conducted by any of them prior to or
after the Closing Date that are not directly traceable to Seller's activities
in conducting the Business before the Closing Date, even if such activities
are substantially the same as the Seller's activities in conducting the
Business before the Closing Date. This covenant not to sue is not
transferable by Equifax, Buyer or any other Subsidiary of Affiliate thereof.

and Business for all periods before and through the Effective Time, or
(v) subject to Sections 10.4, 13.2 and 13.3, any Retained Obligations,
including any fines, penalties or other Losses relating to the failure of
Seller to timely perform or comply with such Retained Obligations.

  



   

53 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

10.2 _By Buyer_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Article XI
and elsewhere herein, Buyer shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Seller
and its Affiliates and Representatives in respect of and against, any and all
Losses incurred or suffered by Seller or its Affiliates or Representatives
arising out of or relating to (i) the Breach of any representation or warranty
of Buyer contained in this Agreement or in any Closing certificate delivered
at Closing expressly pursuant to Section 9.2(e), (ii) any Breach by Buyer or

(vi) to the extent provided in Section 5.6(b) with respect to WARN Act
matters.

  



  

10.3 _Notification and Handling of Third Party Claims_.

  



  

(a) Each Party shall notify the other Party in writing as promptly
as practicable in the circumstances whenever it shall determine that there
are sufficient facts or circumstances that such Party and/or its Affiliates
reasonably believe may render the other Party liable to the notifying Party
and/or its Affiliates pursuant to Section 10.1 or Section 10.2 (as
applicable), giving reasonable details about the nature of the Loss for which
indemnification may be claimed, the expected amount of such Loss (to the
extent reasonably determinable), and a basis for the claim for
indemnification. In addition, in the event that any Claim shall be brought by
any third party or Governmental Body, which, if successful, may render a Party
liable to the other Party and/or its Affiliates pursuant to this Article X,
then the Party and/or its Affiliates seeking indemnification hereunder
(collectively, the " _Indemnitee_ ") shall, as promptly as practicable in the
circumstances after receiving written notice or service of process of such
Claim, give written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") thereof to the Party from
whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnitor_ "). Such Claim Notice
shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Loss, include a copy of
all papers served with respect to an Action (if any) and state a basis of
such request for indemnification. Failure to promptly notify the Indemnitor
will not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to any
Indemnitee, except to the extent that the Indemnitor demonstrates that the
Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by the Indemnitee's failure to give such
notice, but only to the extent of any such Loss directly attributable to the
material prejudice suffered by the Indemnitor. Within 30 days after receipt of
any Claim Notice (or such earlier time as may be appropriate in light of an
obligation to respond to any legal process), the Indemnitor shall notify the
Indemnitee either that (i) the Indemnitor elects to defend the Indemnitee
against such Claim with counsel selected by the Indemnitor and reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnitee, or that (ii) the Indemnitor disputes its
potential liability to indemnify the Indemnitee, provided that such an
aforesaid election by the Indemnitor to not assume the defense of the
Indemnitee for such Claim shall be subject to the right of the Indemnitor to
subsequently assume the defense of the Indemnitee for such Claim at any time
prior to settlement or final determination thereof, provided that any such
subsequent election shall not prejudice any rights of the Indemnitee or its
business or operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this
Agreement to the contrary, if (A) the amount of monetary damages reasonably
sought in connection with such Claim or for which a settlement or award may
be reasonably expected to result in indemnified Losses to the Indemnitee
which may exceed the amount of the indemnified Losses for which the
Indemnitor may be liable under this Agreement (giving effect to any then-
resolved Claims and any then-pending Claims), (B) the Claim is being asserted
by a Governmental Body, or (C) if the Claim seeks equitable relief, the
Indemnitee shall have no obligation to tender the defense thereof to the
Indemnitor and the Indemnitor shall be responsible for all reasonable costs
and expenses and all Losses, subject to the provisions and limitations set
forth in Section 11.1; provided, however, that if the Indemnitee assumes such
defense, the Indemnitor shall have the right to participate in the defense
thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel
employed by the Indemnitee, it being understood that the Indemnitee shall
control such defense.

  



   

54 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(b) If either (i) the Indemnitor and the Indemnitee are both named
as parties to such Claim and the Indemnitee determines in good faith that
joint representation would be inappropriate, (ii) an Indemnitee determines in
good faith that there is a reasonable probability that an Action may
adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary
damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement, or (iii) the Claim involves Losses that might be subject to
indemnification hereunder and other Losses which are not subject to
indemnification hereunder, then the Party asserting such issue shall promptly
notify the other Party after receipt of the Claim Notice, and the Parties
shall then negotiate in good faith to obtain a joint defense (using either
the same or separate counsel, as appropriate) to allocate the costs of defense
and the potential liability for Losses on the Claim on an equitable basis,
based upon each Party's potential exposure for Losses subject to
indemnification, in comparison with Losses that are not subject to
indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnitee disputes that the Claim is not
one that is fully indemnified hereunder, then the Indemnitee shall be
entitled to proceed as provided under Section 10.3(d), but the Indemnitor
shall be liable for the Indemnitee's costs, expenses or Losses only to the
extent finally determined that the Claim is subject to Indemnification
hereunder by reason of an Action or settlement between the Parties regarding
such indemnification dispute.

  



  

(c) If within 30 days of receipt of a Claim Notice, the Indemnitor
notifies the Indemnitee in writing of its election to assume the full control
of defense of a Claim, (i) the Indemnitee shall not be liable to the
Indemnitor for any costs or expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection
with such defense from and after the date Indemnitor notified Indemnitee of
Indemnitor's election to assume the defense of such Claim (but shall be
liable for such costs and expenses incurred prior to receipt of such
written notice), (ii) it will be conclusively established for purposes of
this Agreement that the entire Claim is within the scope of and subject to
indemnification hereunder; (iii) the Indemnitor will not, so long as it
diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnitee under this
Article X for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense of such Claim, and
(iv) the Indemnitee shall not be liable to the Indemnitor for any costs or
expenses incurred by the Indemnitor in connection with such defense, nor for
any Losses rendered or assessed in connection with such Claim, nor for any
Losses resulting from the settlement of any such Claim if settled by the
Indemnitor with or without the written consent of the Indemnitee, provided
however that no compromise or settlement of such Claim may be effected by the
Indemnitor without the Indemnitee's consent unless (A) there is no finding or
admission of any violation of Legal Requirements or any violation of the
rights of any Person and no effect on any other claims that may be made
against the Indemnitee, and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Indemnitor; and (C) the Indemnitee will have no
liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Claim effected
without its consent; and (D) such settlement contains a full and
complete release of such Claim in favor of Indemnitee.

  



   

55 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

(d) If the Indemnitor does not either (i) notify the Indemnitee that
Indemnitor intends to assume full defense of the Claim, (ii) provide notice
under Section 10.3(b) that a matter should be subject to a joint defense, or
(iii) acknowledge that such Claim might be subject to indemnification
pursuant to Section 10.1 and request that Indemnitee assume defense of such
Claim, then subject to Indemnitor's subsequent election to assume such
defense, the Indemnitee may proceed to defend the claim using counsel of its
choice, and to the extent that the Claim is thereafter determined to be
subject to indemnification hereunder, the Indemnitor shall be obligated to
reimburse the Indemnitee for all costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnitee
in connection with investigation and defense of the claim and all Losses
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with any judgment or order entered in
an Action involving the Claim or any settlement of such Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnitor shall not be liable for any Losses incurred
in any settlement made without the Indemnitor's consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned. An Indemnitor's refusal
to consent to any settlement, in a Claim in which such Indemnitor is a party,
that does not provide for a complete release of the subject Claim in favor of
Indemnitor shall not be considered unreasonable.

  



  

10.4 _Specified FCRA Claims_. Notwithstanding Sections 10.1, 10.2
and 10.3, promptly after the Closing Date, Buyer shall assume the defense of,
and shall pay all costs of defending, those Consumer Claims listed on
_Schedule 10.4_ and any other Actions brought in the Ordinary Course of
Business by individual consumers against Seller under the FCRA based in whole
or in part on acts or omissions of Seller or the Business occurring or
alleged to occur on or prior to the Closing Date (collectively, " _Specified
FCRA Claims_ ," which term shall include any Action that includes an FCRA
claim as one of the primary claims even though such Action may also include
one or more similar consumer claims not under the FCRA), including any
Specified FCRA Claims filed after the date hereof or after the Closing. Buyer
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller for any obligations or Liabilities
for amounts payable pursuant to settlements and judgments of Specified FCRA
Claims, provided, however, that Buyer shall not have any obligation to
indemnify or hold harmless Seller against any such obligations or Liabilities
in excess of an aggregate amount for all such settlements and judgments
collectively of $500,000 (exclusive of costs of defense). Seller shall remain
fully responsible for and pay on request of Buyer all settlement and judgment
amounts incurred in excess of such $500,000 (exclusive of costs of
defense) and all such excess amounts shall constitute Retained Obligations,
provided, however that Seller shall not be liable for any such excess amount
to the extent incurred in a settlement of a Specified FCRA Claim made without
Seller's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. For the avoidance of doubt, the Specified FCRA Claims
do not include, and Buyer shall not have any obligation to assume or
indemnify Seller in respect of, any claim or Action of any type or
nature asserted or purportedly asserted as a class action on behalf of a
class of consumers, including the Action asserted on behalf of a class listed
on _Schedule 2.2(c)(iii)_. Seller and/or its Affiliates shall defend any
Action referenced in the immediately preceding sentence at its sole cost and
expense. At any time upon written notice to Buyer, Seller and/or its
Affiliates may assume the defense of any Specified FCRA Claim, at its sole
cost and expense, and Buyer shall have no obligation to pay any amount of any
settlement or judgment with respect to any Specified FCRA Claim the defense of
which Seller assumes. The notice provisions of Section 10.3 with respect to
third party claims thereunder shall apply to any Specified FCRA Claim asserted
against Seller after the Closing.

  



   

56 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

10.5 _Notification of Other Claims_. A claim for indemnification for
any matter not involving a third party claim may be asserted by
written notice to the Party from whom indemnification is sought. Failure to
give such written notification shall affect the indemnification provided
hereunder only to the extent the Indemnitor shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure but only to the extent thereof. Upon
receipt of any such notice, the Indemnitor shall notify the Indemnitee as to
whether the Indemnitor accepts liability for any such Loss.

(c) The right to indemnification under Article X shall continue to
survive for any and all Losses about which an Indemnitor receives

11.4 _Parent Guaranty_. Parent unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Buyer and its successors and assigns the full and
timely performance of Seller's obligations (including all indemnification and
payment obligations) pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to any
agreement, certificate, instrument or other document (including the Ancillary
Agreements) required to be delivered hereunder, in each case as the same is
now or may hereafter be in effect (collectively, the " _Seller Obligations_
"). Parent acknowledges and agrees that this guaranty is full, absolute and
unconditional, is a guaranty of performance and not merely of collection and
is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from
Seller, and no extension, increase, modification, amendment, waiver, consent,
release or extinguishment any of the Seller Obligations (other than in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement), or other change in any Seller
Obligation, whether by agreement of Buyer and Seller, decree in any bankruptcy
proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guaranty, nor shall such validity and
enforceability be affected by any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Seller Obligation as a result of the application of any
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Legal Requirement
relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity to Seller.
Parent hereby waives, for the benefit of Buyer, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, including those which would otherwise require any
election of remedies by Buyer (other than payment of the Seller
Obligations) and further waives any notice (including notice of acceptance or
nonpayment), presentment, demand, performance, protest, suit or other action
as the same pertains to Seller or any of the Seller Obligations, or any right
to require Buyer to proceed against Seller or to exhaust any security held by
any Buyer or to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Seller
Obligations. Buyer may at any time and from time to time without notice to or
consent of Parent and without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Parent under this guaranty, with respect to any of the Seller Obligations, (i)
agree with Seller to make any change in the terms of the Seller Obligations,
(ii) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security
for the Seller Obligations, or (iii) exercise or refrain from exercising any
rights against Seller or others. Parent shall not institute, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to institute, any Action asserting that this guaranty is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms. This guaranty
may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect and
shall be binding on Parent, its successors and assigns until all of the
Seller Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full and shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time and to the
extent that any payment of or other transaction satisfying any of the Seller
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the recipient
thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of
Seller, Parent, or any other Person. Parent understands that Buyer is relying
on this guaranty in entering into this Agreement. References to Buyer in this
Section 11.4 shall include Buyer's Affiliates and their successors and
assigns to the extent any of them are parties to any Ancillary Agreement or
other Seller Obligation.

11.5 _Equifax Guaranty_. Equifax unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Seller and its successors and assigns the full and
timely performance of Buyer's obligations (including all indemnification and
payment obligations) pursuant to this Agreement and pursuant to any
agreement, certificate, instrument or other document (including the Ancillary
Agreements) required to be delivered hereunder, in each case as the same is
now or may hereafter be in effect (collectively, the " _Buyer Obligations_
"). Parent acknowledges and agrees that this guaranty is full, absolute and
unconditional, is a guaranty of performance and not merely of collection and
is in no way conditioned or contingent upon any attempt to collect from Buyer,
and no extension, increase, modification, amendment, waiver, consent, release
or extinguishment any of the Buyer Obligations (other than in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement), or other change in any Buyer Obligation,
whether by agreement of Buyer and Seller, decree in any bankruptcy
proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the continuing validity and
enforceability of this guaranty, nor shall such validity and
enforceability be affected by any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Seller Obligation as a result of the application of any
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar Legal Requirement
relating to creditors' rights and general principles of equity to Buyer.
Equifax hereby waives, for the benefit of Seller, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Legal Requirements, any defenses or benefits that may
be derived from or afforded by law that limit the liability of or exonerate
guarantors or sureties, including those which would otherwise require any
election of remedies by Seller (other than payment of the Buyer
Obligations) and further waives any notice (including notice of acceptance or
nonpayment), presentment, demand, performance, protest, suit or other action
as the same pertains to Buyer or any of the Buyer Obligations, or any right to
require Seller to proceed against Buyer or to exhaust any security held by
any Seller or to pursue any other remedy with respect to any of the Buyer
Obligations. Seller may at any time and from time to time without notice to
or consent of Equifax and without impairing or releasing the obligations of
Equifax under this guaranty, with respect to any of the Buyer Obligations, (i)
agree with Buyer to make any change in the terms of the Buyer Obligations,
(ii) take or fail to take any action of any kind in respect of any security
for the Buyer Obligations, or (iii) exercise or refrain from exercising any
rights against Buyer or others. Equifax shall not institute, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to institute, any Action asserting that this guaranty is
illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms. This guaranty
may not be revoked or terminated and shall remain in full force and effect and
shall be binding on Equifax, its successors and assigns until all of the
Buyer Obligations have been paid and satisfied in full and shall continue to
be effective or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time and to the
extent that any payment of or other transaction satisfying any of the Buyer
Obligations is rescinded or must otherwise be returned by the recipient
thereof upon the insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or similar event of
Buyer, Equifax or any other Person. Equifax understands that Seller is relying
on this guaranty in entering into this Agreement. References to Seller in
this Section 11.5 shall include Seller's Affiliates and their successors
and assigns to the extent any of them are parties to any Ancillary Agreement
or other Buyer Obligation.

prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer;

  



  

(b) by either Party if the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 pm
Eastern time on the Termination Date, provided that the right to terminate
this Agreement under this Section 12.1(b) shall not be available to any Party
whose failure or whose Affiliate's failure to fulfill any obligation under
this Agreement has been a principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on or before the
Termination Date; and provided further that if any of the conditions to
Closing set forth in Article VI, VII or VIII hereof (other than conditions
that by their nature cannot be satisfied until the time of Closing) shall not

either Party by written notice to the other Party given on or before the
December 28, 2012 may extend the Termination Date until March 31, 2013 and

(c) by Buyer, if Buyer is not in material breach of any of its
covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement, and if (i) at any
time that any of the representations and warranties of Seller herein become
untrue or inaccurate such that Section 7.1 would not be satisfied (treating
such time as if it were the Closing Date for purposes of this Section 12.1(d))
(but subject to the provisions of Section 5.12) or (ii) there has been a
breach on the part of Seller of any of its respective covenants, agreements or
obligations contained in this Agreement such that Section 7.2 would not be
satisfied (treating such time as if it were the Closing Date for purposes of
this Section 12.1(d)), and, in both case (i) and case (ii), such breach (if
curable) has not been cured within thirty (30) calendar days after written
notice to Seller; or

  



  

(d) by Seller, if Seller is not in material breach of any of its
covenants, agreements or obligations under this Agreement, and if (i) at any
time that any of the representations and warranties of Buyer herein become
untrue or inaccurate such that Section 6.1 would not be satisfied (treating
such time as if it were the Closing Date for purposes of this Section 12.1(e))
or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of Buyer of any of its respective
covenants, agreements or obligations contained in this Agreement such
that Section 6.2 would not be satisfied (treating such time as if it were the

(e) by Buyer upon written notice to Seller in accordance with
Section 5.12.

  



  

12.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 12.1, all further obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall terminate; provided however, that no such termination
of this Agreement shall act to terminate or otherwise impair the rights or
obligations set forth in this Section 12.2, Section 5.8 or Article XIV;
provided, further, that nothing herein shall relieve a breaching or
defaulting Party for liability arising from any breach or default by such
Party that takes place prior to the date of such termination, or impair the
right of any Party to compel specific performance by any other Party of its
obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

ARTICLE XIII 
 TAXES

  



  

13.1 _Assistance_. Buyer and Seller shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such
information and assistance relating to the Acquired Assets as is reasonably
necessary for filing of all Tax Returns, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any Taxes or making of any
election related to Taxes, the payment of Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Tax authority and the prosecution or defense of any Action
relating to any Tax Return.

  



  

13.2 _Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes arising out of the
transfer of the Acquired Assets and any Transfer Taxes required to effect any
recording or filing with respect thereto shall be borne one half by Seller and
one half by Buyer. Seller and Buyer shall cooperate to determine on a timely
basis the amount of any Transfer Taxes and timely prepare and file any returns
or other filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, in form and substance
satisfactory to each Party, including any claim for exemption or exclusion
from the application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes. The Party obligated
by applicable Legal Requirement to pay over any such Transfer Taxes and file
all necessary documentation and returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes
when due shall timely do so, and shall promptly following the filing thereof
furnish a copy of such return or other filing and a copy of a receipt showing
payment of any such Transfer Tax to the other Party, and if the Party paying
over such Transfer Taxes and filing related Tax Return is (x) Buyer, Seller
shall reimburse Buyer promptly for half of such Transfer Taxes or (y) Seller,
Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly for half of such Transfer Taxes.

  



  

13.3 _Proration_. General and special real estate and other ad
valorem Taxes and assessments and other similar state or local Taxes, fees,
charges and assessments in respect of the Personal Property, if applicable,
on the basis of the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs, whenever imposed
or assessed, shall be prorated between Buyer and Seller as of the Effective
Time (it being understood that Buyer is liable for the same to the extent
accruing after the Effective Time and Seller for those items to the extent
accruing before the Effective Time, based on the number of days falling on or
prior to the Closing Date, on the one hand, and falling after the Closing
Date, on the other hand). If the Closing Date shall occur before the Tax rate
or assessment is fixed for such fiscal year, the apportionment of such Taxes
and payments at the Closing shall be based upon the most recently
ascertainable Tax bills; _provided_ , that Buyer and Seller shall recalculate
and re-prorate said Taxes and payments and make the necessary cash adjustments
promptly upon the issuance, and on the basis, of the actual Tax bills
received for the fiscal year in which the Closing occurs and the amount of
any payments in lieu of Tax made with respect to any such fiscal year. If any
amount required to be apportioned hereunder is paid by Buyer, on the one
hand, or Seller, on the other hand, then Seller or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall promptly reimburse the paying party for the non-paying party's share of
such apportioned amounts. Similarly, if Buyer, on the one hand, or Seller, on
the other hand, receives a refund of any amounts that are required to be
apportioned hereunder, then the recipient of such refund shall promptly pay
to the other party such other party's share of such refund as determined in
accordance with the foregoing apportionment provisions (assuming that Buyer
and Seller contributed to the applicable amount payment in accordance with the
first two sentences of this _Section 13.3_).

  



   

62 
--- 

 


--- 

    



  

13.4 _Operating Taxes_. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall
be solely responsible for all Taxes (other than Transfer Taxes, as set forth
in Section 13.2, and Taxes subject to proration, as set forth in Section 13.3)
incurred in connection with the Acquired Assets or the Business through the
Effective Time, and Buyer shall be solely responsible for all Taxes incurred
in connection with the Acquired Assets or Business after the Effective Time.

in respect of its obligations under this Agreement. Each Party

any such Delaware court. Each Party hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirement, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such Action in any such court.

announcement concerning the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued

or announcement may be required by law or the rules or regulations of any
securities exchange (or in the opinion of counsel such release or announcement
is appropriate or desirable under or in light of such laws and regulations),
in which case the Party making the release or announcement shall allow the
other Party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, and (b) that Seller may make such an announcement
to its employees, in which case Seller shall allow Buyer reasonable time to
