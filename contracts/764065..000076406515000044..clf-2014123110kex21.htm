Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances, all of each Seller's right,
title and interest in, to and under the Assets in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, for the Purchase Price, subject to the adjustments as set
forth in this Agreement. It is the intention of the Parties that the Purchaser
acquire all assets, properties and rights necessary for the operation of the

interests, owned, leased or subleased by any Seller or any Affiliate of any
Seller or Parent, other than the Excluded Assets, or any Contract to which a
Seller is a party and was not an Assumed Contract, were not included in the
Assets sold to Purchaser, and such Contracts, assets, properties or rights are
needed by Purchaser in the operation of the Business, including without
limitation, all mining, processing, loading, transporting, and selling of
coal, then, upon the request of Purchaser, each Seller and Parent shall, and
each Seller and Parent shall cause their respective Affiliates to, convey or

Parent or any Affiliate of any Seller or Parent, whether or not related to the
Assets or the Business, except for the Assumed Liabilities. The Liabilities of
each Seller, Parent and their respective Affiliates not assumed by Purchaser
shall be retained by each Seller respectively and are referred to as "Excluded
Liabilities". Sellers and Parent shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates to, pay and satisfy in due course all Excluded

 2.4 Purchase Price.

2.4.1 On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
Purchaser shall, as consideration for the Assets, pay to Sellers the aggregate

Liabilities. The Base Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment at and
after Closing in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (as adjusted, the
"Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall be payable at the Closing as
follows:

(a)Purchaser shall deliver the Escrow Amount and Regulatory Escrow Amount
(each withheld and credited against the Base Purchase Price) to the Escrow

Agreement;

(b)Purchaser may, but is not required to, pay to each Seller's creditors a
portion of the Base Purchase Price, for the benefit of such Seller, to pay off
any Indebtedness of such Seller that is required to be paid off in order to
release any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) on any Assets or
to pay off any capital leases related to any of the Assets; and

(c)Purchaser shall pay to Sellers the balance of the Base Purchase Price
(being the Base Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, less
the Escrow Amount, Regulatory Escrow Amount and any payments made to each
Seller's creditors as set forth above) in cash, by wire transfer of
immediately available United States funds to an account or accounts designated
by Sellers in written instructions given to Purchaser at least two business
days prior to the Closing.

2.4.2 Schedule 2.4.2 sets forth the tax allocation statement ("Initial Tax
Allocation Statement") to reflect the allocation of the Purchase Price among
the Assets for purposes of Section 1060 of the Code as of the Closing Date.
Within ninety (90) days after the Closing, Parent and Purchaser agree to
adjust the Initial Tax Allocation Statement to reflect all adjustments to the
Purchase Price after the Closing Date ("Final Tax Allocation Statement")
determined pursuant to Section 2.5. Purchaser and Parent shall each (i) timely
file all forms and Tax Returns required to be filed in connection with such
Final Tax Allocation Statement, (ii) be bound by such allocation for purposes
of determining Taxes, and (iii) take no position, and cause their respective
Affiliates to take no position, inconsistent with such allocation on any
applicable Tax Return or in any audit or proceeding before any Tax authority.
In the event that the allocation set forth on the Final Tax Allocation
Statement is disputed by any Tax authority, the Party receiving notice of such
dispute shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto concerning the
existence and resolution of such dispute. If the Parties cannot agree on the
Final Tax Allocation Statement within the ninety (90) day period, the issue(s)
in dispute will be submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution. The
determination of the Independent Accountant, acting as experts and not as
arbitrators, shall be set forth in a written notice delivered, as promptly as
practicable after the issue(s) in dispute have been submitted to the
Independent Accountant, to the Purchaser and the Parent by the Independent
Accountant and will be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties. The
Purchaser and the Parent shall each bear 50% of the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accountant for such determination. The Purchaser and the Parent
will use all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant to render its decision as promptly as practicable, including
without limitation by promptly complying with all reasonable requests by the
Independent Accountant for information, books, records and similar items.

2.5 Adjustment to Purchase Price. All adjustments to the Purchase Price shall
be estimated and finally determined as set forth below in this Section 2.5.

2.5.1 Increases in Purchase Price. As provided in this Section 2.5, the Base
Purchase Price shall be increased by the amount, if any, by which Closing Date
Working Capital is greater than Target Base Working Capital.

 2.5.2 Decreases in Purchase Price. As provided in this Section 2.5, the Base
Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount, if any, by which Target Base
Working Capital is greater than Closing Date Working Capital.

2.5.3 Estimated Purchase Price Adjustments and Closing Payment. At least three
business days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Parent shall deliver to
Purchaser a certificate duly executed by an authorized officer of Parent
setting forth (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Business, as
of the close of business on the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP
(the "Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet"), and (ii) based thereon, a good
faith, reasonable estimate of the Closing Date Working Capital (the "Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital"), together with work papers or other supporting
documentation showing the preparation or calculation thereof. The calculation
of the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital shall be made in a manner
consistent with the illustrative calculation of the Closing Date Working
Capital on Schedule 2.5.3, which shows an example of how the Closing Date
Working Capital would have been calculated assuming a deemed September 30,
2014 closing.

2.5.4 Adjustments to Base Purchase Price. On the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, on the Closing Date, Purchaser shall adjust the
amount of the Base Purchase Price that is paid to Sellers as follows:

(a)Increase the Base Purchase Price by an amount, if any, that is equal to the
amount by which Estimated Closing Date Working Capital is greater than Target
Base Working Capital; and

(b)Decrease the Base Purchase Price by an amount, if any that is equal to the
amount, if any, by which Target Base Working Capital is greater than Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital.

2.5.5 Special Consideration for Accounts Receivable in Calculation of Final
Closing Date Working Capital. With respect to the calculation of the Final
Closing Date Working Capital, the dollar amount of Accounts Receivables used
in determining the Final Closing Date Working Capital shall be adjusted to
reflect the actual amount of funds that Purchaser has collected and received
from the Accounts Receivable by the 89th day after the Closing Date and the
reserve for the allowance of doubtful accounts shall be adjusted to zero. To
the extent that one or more Accounts Receivable remain uncollected at such
time and are not included as Current Assets in the Final Closing Date Working
Capital adjustment, such uncollected Accounts Receivables shall revert back to
Sellers, shall be deemed Excluded Assets and, thereafter, Sellers shall be
entitled, at its option, to collect and retain any collections from such
Accounts Receivable.

2.5.6 Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments and Final Payment. Within 90
days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Parent the
following information with respect to Sellers: (i) consolidated balance sheet
of the Business, as of the close of business on the Closing Date, prepared in
accordance with GAAP (the "Closing Date Balance Sheet"), and (ii) based
thereon and the special adjustments set forth in Section 2.5.5, a calculation
of the final Closing Date Working Capital (the "Final Closing Date Working
Capital") (such delivery, the "Post-Closing Delivery"). The calculation of the
Estimated Closing Date Working Capital shall be made in a manner consistent
with the illustrative calculation of the Closing Date Working Capital on
Schedule 2.5.3. Parent shall have 45 days from the date Purchaser delivers the
Post-Closing Delivery to Parent (such period, the "Dispute Period") to notify
Purchaser, in writing, as to whether Parent agrees or disagrees with the Post-
Closing Delivery, which such notice shall identify in reasonable detail those
items and amounts to which Parent objects (such written notice, the "Dispute
Notice"). During the Dispute Period, Parent and its accountants shall be
permitted to review (during regular business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice) the working papers of Purchaser and (where applicable) Purchaser's
accountants to the extent relating to the matters set forth in the Post-
Closing Delivery, in each case as is reasonably requested in writing by
Parent. If Parent fails to deliver a Dispute Notice to Purchaser during the
Dispute Period, (Y) the Closing Date Balance Sheet as prepared by Purchaser
shall be deemed to have been correctly prepared, and (Z) Purchaser's
calculation of Final Closing Date Working Capital shall be

 deemed to be final and correct and shall be binding upon all Parties. If
Parent delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser with respect to some, but not
all, of the amounts or items included in the Post-Closing Delivery during the
Dispute Period, then Parent and Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with
Purchaser's calculations of all amounts set forth in such Post-Closing
Delivery that were not disputed in such duly and timely delivered Dispute
Notice.

2.5.7 Resolution Period. If Parent delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser
during the Dispute Period, Parent and Purchaser shall, for a period of 30 days
from the date the Dispute Notice is delivered to Purchaser (such period, the
"Resolution Period"), negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable
efforts to amicably resolve the items in dispute. Any items so resolved shall
be deemed to be final and correct as so resolved and shall be binding upon
each of the Parties hereto.

2.5.8 Dispute Resolution.

(a)If Parent and Purchaser are unable in good faith to resolve all of the
items in dispute during the Resolution Period, then, upon the expiration of
the Resolution Period or such earlier date as Purchaser and Parent mutually
agree, Purchaser and Parent shall refer the items remaining in dispute in
writing to the Independent Accountant and shall deliver to the Independent
Accountants, at the time of such referral, the Post-Closing Delivery and the
Dispute Notice. The parties shall also furnish the Independent Accountants
with such other information and documents as the Independent Accountants may
reasonably request in order for them to resolve the items in dispute. Parent
and Purchaser shall also, within 20 days of the date the items in dispute are
referred to the Independent Accountants, provide the Independent Accountants
with a written statement (a "Position Statement") describing in reasonable
detail their respective positions on the items in dispute (copies of which
will concurrently be delivered to the other party). If any party fails to
timely deliver its Position Statement to the Independent Accountants, the
Independent Accountants shall resolve the items in dispute solely upon the
basis of the information otherwise provided to them. The Independent
Accountants shall resolve all disputed items in a written determination to be
delivered to Purchaser and Parent within 30 days after such matter is referred
to them; provided, however, that any delay in delivering such determination
shall not invalidate such determination or deprive the Independent Accountants
of jurisdiction to resolve the items in dispute; provided, further, in
resolving any disputed item, the Independent Accountants shall adhere to the
definitions contained in this Agreement and the practices and other principles
referred to therein. In no event shall the Independent Accountants assign a
value to Final Closing Date Working Capital that is greater than the highest
or less than the lowest calculation thereof proposed by Purchaser in the Post-
Closing Delivery and Parent in the Dispute Notice. The decision of the
Independent Accountants, acting as experts and not as arbitrators, made in
accordance with this Agreement as to the items in dispute shall be final and
binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to judicial review.
The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountants incurred in the
resolution of any items in dispute shall be determined by the Independent
Accountants and set forth in its report and shall be allocated and paid by the
party whose calculation of the items in dispute is furthest from the
Independent Accountant's determination of the items in dispute, with any
amounts that are payable by Parent and/or Sellers paid out of the Escrow
Amount.

(b)Within seven days after the final determination of the Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the calculation of the Final Closing Date Working Capital (whether
through failure of Parent to timely deliver a Dispute Notice, agreement of the
Parties, or determination of the Independent Accountants):

i. if the Final Closing Date Working Capital is greater than the Estimated
Closing Date Working Capital, Purchaser shall pay such excess to Sellers in
immediately available funds via wire transfer;

 ii. if the Final Closing Date Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing
Date Working Capital (the absolute value of the difference, the "Deficit
Amount"), Purchaser and Parent shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay the
Deficit Amount to Purchaser out of the Escrow Amount (including any interest
earned thereon). Payments under Sections 2.5.8(b)(i) and (ii) are referred to
as the "Final Consideration Payment".

2.5.9 Exclusivity. The dispute resolution procedures set forth in this Section
2.5 are the sole and exclusive means and remedy for determining and
calculating Current Assets, Current Liabilities, Closing Date Working Capital,
Final Closing Date Working Capital and the components thereof, other than (i)
in the event of a breach of a covenant or agreement set forth in this ARTICLE
2 relating thereto, in which case the aggrieved Party shall be entitled to
such other rights and remedies as are permitted by this Agreement or (ii) in
the event of fraud or willful misconduct, in which case the aggrieved party
shall be entitled to such other rights and remedies as are permitted by
applicable Law.

2.6 Regulatory Escrow Amount.

2.6.1 The Regulatory Escrow Amount will be used to pay for any Losses related
to any Liabilities (including fines, penalties, fees and associated interest
or charges related thereto) imposed by any Governmental Authority (including
MSHA, WVOMHST, EPA and WVDEP) for citations, orders or other enforcement
Actions of any type or kind based on events that occurred on or before the
Closing Date and relating to (a) any Permit or (b) any facility owned,
controlled or operated by any Seller prior to the Closing Date (including,

thereof, whether by settlement, administrative litigation or otherwise
(collectively the "Regulatory Costs"). The Regulatory Escrow Amount shall be
held by the Escrow Agent until the earlier of the date that all Regulatory
Costs are paid or the third anniversary of the Closing Date ("Regulatory
Escrow Period").

2.6.2 With respect to any Actions or claims related to any Regulatory Costs
("Regulatory Actions"), Sellers and Parent agree that Purchaser shall control
the defense of the Regulatory Actions with counsel that is reasonably

by Purchaser. Purchaser shall not settle any Regulatory Action without the

been made with respect to the amount of a Regulatory Cost, the Escrow Agent
shall pay the amount so determined to the payee designated in the joint
written instruction. If at any time after the Closing and before Escrow
Release Date all Regulatory Costs have been fully satisfied and discharged,
the remaining amount of the Regulatory Escrow Amount shall be automatically
added to and become a part of the Escrow Amount. In the event that all
Regulatory Costs are not fully satisfied and discharged until after the Escrow
Release Date, then Parent and Purchaser shall direct the Escrow Agent to pay
to Sellers any funds remaining out of the Regulatory Escrow Amount, if any.
If, however, at the end of the Regulatory Escrow Period, or at any time prior
to that, there are insufficient funds available from the Regulatory Escrow
Amount to fully satisfy and discharge any Regulatory Costs, Purchaser shall be
entitled to recovery from the Escrow Amount any amounts necessary to fully
satisfy and

 discharge any unpaid Regulatory Costs. Sellers, Parent and Purchaser further
agree to execute and deliver such other documents and to do such other acts
and things, to effect any release of the Regulatory Escrow Amount as
contemplated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

2.7 Escrow Funds. At the Closing, Purchaser shall pay to the Escrow Agent the
Escrow Amount and Regulatory Escrow Amount (each, an "Escrow Fund") in cash
payable by wire transfer of immediately available United States funds for
deposit into an escrow account or escrow accounts (provided if in a single
escrow account, for purposes of this Agreement they shall be treated as
separate accounts) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Amount shall serve as security for the payment to
satisfy any Losses incurred by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under ARTICLE
11 and to the extent necessary any Regulatory Costs, and shall be held and
distributed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and shall be held and distributed by
the Escrow Agent in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement. If, however, there are insufficient funds available
from the Escrow Amount to fully satisfy and discharge any Losses incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recovery from the Regulatory Escrow Amount any amounts necessary
to fully satisfy and discharge any such Losses. The Regulatory Escrow Amount
shall be used to satisfy any Losses related to the Regulatory Costs as set
forth above and shall be held and distributed by the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement.

Release Date"), and the Escrow Agent shall disburse to Sellers no later than
30 days after the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the Closing Date the
remaining portion of the Escrow Amount (as reduced by any amounts previously
disbursed to Purchaser or Sellers (the "Second Escrow Release Date" and
together with the First Escrow Release Date, collectively, the "Escrow Release
Dates" or individually a "Release Escrow Date"). In the event, however, that
either Sellers or Parent has received, on or before an applicable Escrow
Release Date, a notice (a "Claim Notice") from the Purchaser that the Escrow
Agent may be required to disburse all or a portion of the Escrow Amount (such
claimed amount, the "Claim Amount") to the Purchaser pursuant to ARTICLE 11,
then the portion of the Escrow Amount subject to such Claim Notice shall
continue to be held by the Escrow Agent (and not disbursed to Sellers on any
Escrow Release Date) until the Claim Amount with respect thereto has been
resolved. As soon as any dispute with respect to such Claim Amount has been
resolved in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Escrow
Agent shall be instructed to disburse such portion of the Escrow Amount, if
any, as is required to be disbursed to Purchaser pursuant to ARTICLE 11 in
connection with such Claim Amount, and the Escrow Agent shall disburse any
remaining portion of the Claim Amount to Sellers in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, subject to the limitations on
disbursements to Sellers set forth in this Section 2.8.

arising under such Unassigned Asset for the benefit of Sellers and the other

company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware. Each Seller is duly qualified and properly
authorized to (i) own, operate or lease its properties, (ii) conduct the

to each Seller and Parent has been taken to approve this Agreement and the
Transactions and no other action on the part of any Seller or Parent is
necessary to authorize this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each Seller and Parent and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of each Seller and Parent, enforceable in accordance with its
terms, subject, however, to the effect of, and then only to the extent that
enforceability may be limited by, bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws relating to the rights and remedies of creditors,
as well as to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the
Transactions, and the performance by each Seller and Parent of its obligations
under this Agreement in accordance with its terms will not require the
approval or consent of, or notice to or filing with, any Governmental
Authority, except as related to the HSR Act and as necessary for transfer of
the Permits and the bonds related thereto and the designation of Purchaser as
operator thereunder pending transfer to Purchaser.

8.3 No Breach. The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller and
Parent of this Agreement and any other documents pertaining to the

Parent or any of the Assets may be bound, or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Encumbrance, other than a Permitted Encumbrance, upon the
Assets under any Contract to which any Seller or Parent or their respective
properties may be bound. Assuming receipt of the Consents set forth on
Schedule 8.21, neither any Seller nor Parent is a party to any Contract, nor
is any Seller or Parent bound by, any judgment, injunction or decree of any
Governmental Authority, which in any respect may restrict or interfere with
the performance of this Agreement.

unaudited consolidated balance sheets of the Business as at December 31, 2012

of notes (that, if presented, would not differ materially from those included
in the Year-End Financial Statements). The Financial Statements reflect the
consistent application of GAAP throughout the periods involved, except as
disclosed in the notes to the Year-End Financial Statements. No financial
statements of any Person other than Sellers are required by GAAP to be
included or reflected in the Financial Statements. The Financial Statements

Licenses, or any applications therefor, appealed, denied, revoked, restricted
or suspended and is not currently a party to any proceedings involving the
possible appeal, denial, revocation, restriction or suspension of any Permits,
bonds related thereto, or Licenses or any of the privileges granted

under the provisions of the Applicant Violator System (or any similar system)
by any Governmental Authority ("AVS").

other third party under any of the Leases, (ii) any party, other than a
Seller, under the Assumed Contracts, except for both (i) and (ii) those

of the customers of Sellers by sales revenue for the year 2013 and for the
first nine months of 2014. With respect to the current customers to whom
Purchaser will be making coal deliveries after Closing: (i) the Accounts
Receivable from such customers are current and being paid in accordance with
each customer's respective coal supply agreements; and (ii) there are no
outstanding quality or quantity adjustments to pricing that will cause a
material deduction from, or delay, any payments to be received by Purchaser.
No Seller, nor any Affiliates of any Seller, has received any notice (orally
or in writing), and has no Knowledge, that any of its customers will cancel,
terminate, or fail to perform its obligations under their existing coal supply
Contracts.

8.23 Suppliers. With respect to the Business, Schedule 8.23 sets forth a list

timely filed (in accordance with any extensions duly granted by the
appropriate Governmental Authority, if applicable) with the appropriate
Governmental Authorities all Tax Returns and reports required to be filed with
any Governmental Authority. All such Tax Returns or reports are true, complete
and accurate in all respects. No jurisdiction in which Sellers do not file a
Tax Return has made a claim that any Seller is required to file a Tax Return
in such jurisdiction.

8.26.2 Payment of Taxes. Except for such items as a Seller may be disputing in
good faith by proceedings in compliance with applicable Law, each of which is
described in Schedule 8.26.2 of the Disclosure Schedules, (i) each Seller has
paid all Taxes that have become due with respect to any Taxes for any tax year
ending on or before the Closing Date or any partial tax year that includes any
period prior

 to the Closing Date (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) and has properly
accrued on its books and records for all of the same that have not yet become
due and (ii) no Seller is delinquent in the payment of any Tax. The unpaid
Taxes of Sellers (i) did not, as of the date of the Interim Balance Sheet
Date, exceed the applicable reserve for Tax liability (rather than any reserve
for deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
Tax income) set forth on the face of the Interim Balance Sheet and (ii) will
not exceed that reserve as adjusted for the passage of time through the
Closing Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of Sellers in
filing Tax Returns.

8.26.3 No Pending Deficiencies, Delinquencies, Assessments or Audits. No
Seller, nor any Affiliates of any Seller, have received any notice or received
any other communication from any Governmental Authority that any Tax
deficiency or delinquency has been asserted against Seller that could result
in an Encumbrance on any of the Assets. No Seller, nor any trustee, director
or officer (or employee responsible for Tax matters) of any Seller expects any
authority to assess any additional Taxes for any period for which Tax Returns
have been filed. There is no unpaid assessment, proposal for additional Taxes,
deficiency or delinquency in the payment of any of the Taxes of any Seller
that has been asserted by any Governmental Authority. Other than routine
audits of the consolidated Tax Returns of Parent, none of which are directly
targeted at a Seller, the Assets or the Business, no Seller, nor any Affiliate
of any Seller, has received notice or received any other communication from
any Governmental Authority that a Governmental Authority audit of any Seller
is pending or such audit is threatened. The results of any completed audits
are properly reflected in the Financial Statements.

8.26.4 Extension of Limitation Period. There are no Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances) for Taxes upon any Assets. No Seller has requested an
extension of time within which to file any Tax Return with respect to any
taxable period for which a Tax Return has not since been filed. No Seller has
granted an extension to any Governmental Authority of the limitation period
during which any Tax liability may be assessed or collected.

8.26.5 Withholding Requirements Satisfied. All monies required to be withheld
by any Seller and/or paid to Governmental Authorities for social security,
Medicare, unemployment insurance, and all income, sales, excise, use, and
other Taxes have been collected or withheld and/or paid to the respective
Governmental Authorities in accordance with applicable Law.

8.26.6 Section 168 Property. None of the assets of any Seller are "tax-exempt
use property" or "tax-exempt bond financed property" within the meaning of
Section 168 of the Code. No Seller is a party to any "long-term contract"
within the meaning of Section 460 of the Code.

any international boycott as defined in Section 999 of the Code.

8.26.8 [Intentionally Omitted]

8.26.9 Pass-through Entities. No Seller is a party to any joint venture,
partnership or other arrangement that is treated as a partnership or as a
disregarded or transparent entity for any Tax purpose.

Seller shall pay any and all Taxes that may be now or hereafter due with
respect to the Assets, the Business or the activities of any Seller through

with its terms shall not require the approval or consent of, or notice to or
filing with, any foreign, federal, state, county, local or other governmental

related thereto and the designation of Purchaser as operator thereunder
pending transfer to Purchaser.

9.3 No Breach. The execution, delivery and performance by Purchaser of this

from disclosing such records to Seller pursuant to applicable Law or Contract
(other than an Assumed Contract).

Employees.

the Closing, Sellers and Parent shall fully cooperate with Purchaser in its
efforts to interview certain material customers of Sellers as specified by
Purchaser and agreed to by such Seller (and such agreement not to be

Purchaser and all such customers. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to agree upon the timing of and a process by which any such
key customer visits shall take place.

a consent by such lessor to the assignment of the Baisden-Vaughan Lease to
Purchaser and an estoppel certificate from such lessor that there does not
exist any defaults under the Baisden-Vaughan Lease and that such lease is
still in full force and effect. In the event that the Parties are unable to
get a resolution to the dispute with the lessor of

 the Baisden-Vaughan Lease that is reasonably acceptable to all Parties, then
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to remove
the Baisden-Vaughan Lease as an Asset (and make it an Excluded Asset) and make
a corresponding adjustment to either the Purchase Price or the Target Base
Working Capital.

11.4 Limitations on Indemnification. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement any indemnification claims shall be limited as
follows (other than any indemnification claims or other Actions based upon (i)

to the limitations set forth in this Section 11.4):

otherwise payable under Section 11.2.1 and no indemnification by the Purchaser
with respect to any Loss otherwise payable under Section 11.3.1, shall in
either case be payable until such time as all such indemnifiable Losses shall
aggregate to more than $875,000 (the "Basket"), after which time Sellers and
Parent, or Purchaser (as the case may be) shall be liable in full for all
indemnifiable Losses above $175,000.

Further, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, other than any claim
based upon fraud or wilful misconduct, all Parties indemnification obligations
herein shall not exceed under any circumstances an amount equal to fifty
percent (50%) of the Purchase Price.

11.5 Indemnification Procedures.

11.5.1 The obligations and Liabilities of the Parties under this ARTICLE 11
with respect to Losses arising from claims of any third party which are
subject to the indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE 11 ("Third Party
Claims") shall be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in this
Section 11.5. If any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party
(each, an "Indemnified Party"), as the case may be, shall receive written
notice of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give Sellers and
Parent or the Purchaser (each, the "Indemnifying Party"), as the case may be,
notice of such Third Party Claim within 20 days after the receipt by the
Indemnified Party of such notice; provided, however, that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
respective obligations under this ARTICLE 11 except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such

 failure. The notice of claim shall describe in reasonable detail the facts
known to the Indemnified Party giving rise to such indemnification claim, and
the amount or good faith estimate of the amount arising therefrom.

11.5.2 The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such Third Party Claim at its expense and through counsel of its
choice if it gives written notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified
Party within twenty-five (25) days of the receipt of such notice from the
Indemnified Party and the Third Party Claim involves money damages and not an
injunction or other equitable relief that could have an adverse effect on the
Assets and the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its Liability to the
Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE 11 and agrees to indemnify the
Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of this ARTICLE 11; provided,
however, in the event that Indemnified Party reasonably determines (i) there
exists or is reasonably likely to exist a conflict of interest that would make
it inappropriate in the judgment of the Indemnified Party in its reasonable
discretion for the same counsel to represent both the Indemnified Party and
the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the Third Party Claim seeks an injunction or
equitable relief against any Indemnified Party or relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, or (iii) the Indemnified Party has
reasonably determined that the Losses from the Third Party Claim are likely to
exceed the limits of the remaining indemnification obligation of the
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement, then, in each such instance, the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of the
Third Party Claim at the expense of the Indemnifying Party. In the event that
the Indemnifying Party exercises the right to undertake any such defense
against any such Third Party Claim as provided above, the Indemnifying Party
shall conduct the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently and
the Indemnified Party shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such
defense and make available to the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying
Party's expense, all witnesses, pertinent records, materials and information
in the Indemnified Party's possession or under the Indemnified Party's control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party.
Similarly, in the event the Indemnified Party is, directly or indirectly,
conducting the defense against any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in such defense and make
available to the Indemnified Party, at the Indemnifying Party's expense, all
such witnesses, records, materials and information in the Indemnifying Party's
possession or under the Indemnifying Party's control relating thereto as is
reasonably required by the Indemnified Party. No such Third Party Claim may be
settled by any Party conducting the defense against such claim without the
prior written consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably delayed or withheld; provided, however, Parent shall have the
right to settle any claim (other than claims for Taxes) for which it is the
Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of any other Party if
such settlement provides for a complete and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Party, does not include any admission of culpability and involves
only the payment of money damages.

11.6 Calculation of Losses. The Parties shall make appropriate adjustments for
Tax benefits and insurance coverage actually realized or received in
determining Losses for purposes of this ARTICLE 11. All indemnification
payments under this ARTICLE 11 shall be deemed adjustments to the Purchase
Price.

11.7 Exclusive Remedy. Except as provided in Section 2.4 and Section 2.5 and
any Actions for injunctive relief or specific performance as set forth in this
Agreement, Actions for a breach of Sections 13.5 or Section 14.5 or any
Actions based upon fraud or wilful misconduct, any Action (whether such claim
sounds in tort, contract or otherwise and including statutory rights and
remedies) based upon, relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the
Transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise in respect of the
status, operations or ownership of the Assets and the Business on or prior to
the Closing Date must be brought by the Parties in accordance with the
provisions and applicable limitations of this ARTICLE 11, which shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of all Parties, their affiliates,
successors and assigns for any such Actions.

11.8 Materiality Scrape. For purposes of this ARTICLE 11 the determination of
an inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by a Party
in this Agreement shall be determined without regard to any materiality,
Material Adverse Change or other similar qualification contained in or
otherwise applicable to such representation and warranty.

 11.9 No Duplication of Recovery. In no event shall any Purchaser Indemnified
Party have any right to indemnification from Sellers or Parent for Losses
relating to any matter to the extent such matter was reserved for and taken
into account in finally determining the Final Closing Date Working Capital.

11.10 Escrow Fund. The Escrow Funds, to the extent available, will serve as
the initial source of payment from Seller or Parent for indemnification claims
by the Purchaser Indemnified Parties.

notice by Purchaser to Sellers specifying such breach.
