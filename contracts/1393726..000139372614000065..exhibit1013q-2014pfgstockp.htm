Cash Consideration minus the sum of (i) the Estimated Excess Indebtedness and
(ii) the Estimated Leakage Amount (such amount, the "Estimated
Consideration").



Section 1.3 Other Closing Deliveries. At the Closing, in addition to Sellers'

in Section 1.2(a) and Buyer's payment of the amounts specified in Section
1.2(b), and as otherwise set forth herein:

(l) each party hereto shall deliver to the other such other documents and
instruments as may be reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

All such certificates, stock powers, documents and instruments shall be in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the party hereto receiving
delivery thereof hereunder.

Section 1.4 Additional Consideration.

(a) Pre-Closing Estimate; Closing of the Books on the Closing Date. Not later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall deliver to
the Buyer a statement (the "Pre-Closing Estimate") setting forth the Sellers'
good faith calculation of the Estimated Consideration and including a
description in reasonable detail of the estimated Excess Indebtedness (the
"Estimated Excess Indebtedness") and the estimated Leakage Amount (the
"Estimated Leakage



Amount"). The Pre-Closing Estimate (and each component thereof) shall be
calculated in accordance with the Accounting Principles. In addition, in
preparation for the Closing, Sellers shall cause a full balance sheet closing
to take place with respect to the Transferred Companies as of the close of
business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (the "Closing
Balance Sheet Date"), as if it were the last day of a fiscal period for the
Transferred Companies, including by preparing all closing entries and post-
closing trial balances in respect of the Closing Balance Sheet Date.

(b) Closing Statement. As soon as practicable, and in any event within ninety
(90) days following the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the
Seller Representative a statement (the "Closing Statement") comprising a
consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows of the Company as of
the Closing Balance Sheet Date and calculations in reasonable detail of (i)
the 2014 Net Working Capital, (ii) 2014 Excess Cash, (iii) the Additional
Consideration derived from the amounts in clauses (i) and (ii), (iv) Excess
Indebtedness, (v) the Leakage Amount and (vi) the Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up
Amount derived from the amounts in clauses (iv) and (v). The Closing Statement
(and each component thereof) shall be calculated in accordance with the
Accounting Principles and in a form consistent with, and subject to the
adjustments set forth in, the sample Closing Statement attached hereto as
Annex A. From and after the delivery of the Closing Statement until such time
as the Closing Statement becomes final, binding and conclusive upon the
parties, Buyer shall (i) make available to the Seller Representative and its
accountants and advisors the documents and data used in the preparation of, or
reasonably related to, the Closing Statement and each of the components
thereof and (ii) give the Seller Representative access, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to the personnel, accountants,
properties, books and records of the Transferred Companies for the purpose of
determining whether the Closing Statement contains any mathematical errors or
was prepared in a manner inconsistent with the Accounting Principles.

(c) Dispute Notice. The Closing Statement shall become final, binding and
conclusive upon the parties on the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt by
the Seller Representative of the Closing Statement, unless prior to such
thirtieth (30th) day the Seller Representative delivers to Buyer a written
notice (a "Dispute Notice") stating that the Seller Representative believes
that the Closing Statement contains mathematical errors or was not prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and specifying in reasonable detail
each item that the Seller Representative disputes (a "Disputed Item"), the
amount in dispute for each such Disputed Item and the reasons supporting the
Seller Representative's positions. The Seller Representative may not challenge
the Closing Statement on any other basis.

(d) Resolution Period. If the Seller Representative timely delivers a Dispute
Notice, then Buyer and the Seller Representative shall seek in good faith to
resolve the Disputed Items during the 15-day period beginning on the date
Buyer receives the Dispute Notice (the "Resolution Period"). If Buyer and the
Seller Representative reach agreement with respect to any Disputed Items,
Buyer shall revise the Closing Statement to reflect such agreement.

(e) Independent Accountant. If Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable
to resolve all of the Disputed Items during the Resolution Period, then Buyer
and the Seller



Representative shall jointly engage and submit the unresolved Disputed Items
(the "Unresolved Items") to the Independent Accountant; provided that if Buyer
and the Seller Representative do not appoint an Independent Accountant within
ten (10) days after the end of the Resolution Period, they shall request the
American Arbitration Association to appoint as the Independent Accountant a
nationally recognized independent registered public accounting firm that has
not had a material relationship with the Transferred Companies, the Seller
Representative, any Seller, Buyer or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing,
within the preceding two years, and such appointment shall be final, binding
and conclusive on Buyer, Sellers and the Seller Representative. Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Independent Accountant to issue its written determination regarding the
Unresolved Items within thirty (30) days after the Unresolved Items are
submitted for review, and Buyer, Sellers and the Seller Representative shall
cooperate with the Independent Accountant during its engagement. Buyer and the
Seller Representative shall promptly (and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days) after the Independent Accountant's engagement, each submit to
the Independent Accountant their respective computations of the Unresolved
Items and information, arguments and support for their respective positions,
and shall concurrently deliver a copy of such materials to the other party.
Each of Buyer and the Seller Representative shall then be given an opportunity
to supplement the information, arguments and support included in its initial
submission with one additional submission to respond to any arguments or
positions taken by the other party in such other party's initial submission,
which supplemental information shall be submitted to the Independent
Accountant (with a copy thereof to the other party) within five (5) Business
Days after the first date on which both parties have submitted their
respective initial submissions to the Independent Accountant. The Independent
Accountant shall thereafter be permitted to request additional or clarifying
information from the parties, and each of the parties shall cooperate with
such requests of the Independent Accountant; provided that communication with
the Independent Accountant by any party hereto or any of their respective
representatives with respect to or in any way related to the duties
contemplated to be performed by the Independent Accountant hereby may not
occur ex parte, and each of the Seller Representative and Buyer or their
respective designees must participate in any such communication, including by
receiving copies of any materials submitted to the Independent Accountant in
connection herewith. The Independent Accountant shall determine, based solely
on the materials so presented by the parties and upon information received in
response to such requests for additional or clarifying information and not by
independent review, only those Unresolved Items still in dispute and shall
render a written report to Buyer and the Seller Representative in which the
Independent Accountant sets forth its determination regarding what
adjustments, if any, should be made to the amounts and computations set forth
in the Closing Statement solely as to the Unresolved Items and shall
determine, on that basis, the appropriate amount of the 2014 Net Working
Capital, 2014 Excess Cash, the Additional Consideration, Excess Indebtedness,
the Leakage Amount and the Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount,. In resolving
any Unresolved Item, the Independent Accountant (x) shall be bound to the
principles of this Section 1.4 and the terms of this Agreement, (y) shall
limit its review to matters specifically set forth in the Dispute Notice and
(z) shall not assign a value to any item higher than the highest value for
such item claimed by either party or less than the lowest value for such item
claimed by either party. The report of the Independent Accountant shall be
final, binding and conclusive on Buyer, Sellers and the Seller Representative
absent manifest error, and Buyer shall revise the Closing Statement to reflect
the determination of



the Independent Accountant as set forth in such report promptly upon receipt
thereof. The fees, expenses and costs of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne equally by Buyer and Sellers.

(f) Adjustment Amounts.

(i) If a positive Additional Consideration is finally determined to exist
pursuant to this Section 1.4, then Buyer shall pay such Additional
Consideration to Sellers by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account or accounts designated in writing by the Seller Representative on
behalf of all Sellers as follows: (A) one-third (1/3) of such amount shall be
so payable on the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) two-thirds
(2/3) of such amount shall be so payable on the second anniversary of the
Closing Date.

(ii) If a negative Additional Consideration is finally determined to exist
pursuant to this Section 1.4, then Sellers shall promptly, and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days after such final determination, pay or cause to
be paid their respective Allocated Portion of such Additional Consideration by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated within
two (2) Business Days following such final determination to the Seller
Representative in writing by Buyer.

(iii) If a positive Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be payable to Buyer) and a positive Additional
Consideration (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be payable to Sellers)
are finally determined to exist pursuant to this Section 1.4, then (x) if the
Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount is less than or equal to the Additional
Consideration, the Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount shall reduce the
aggregate amount of Additional Consideration to be paid to Sellers under
Section 1.4(f)(i), and (y) if the Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount is
greater than the Additional Consideration, Sellers shall promptly, and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days after such final determination, pay or
cause to be paid their respective Allocated Portion of the difference between
the Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount and the Additional Consideration by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated within
two (2) Business Days following such final determination to the Seller
Representative in writing by Buyer and the Additional Consideration shall be
reduced to zero.

(iv) If both a positive Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount and a negative
Additional Consideration are finally determined to exist pursuant to this
Section 1.4, then Sellers shall promptly, and in any event within ten (10)
Business Days after such final determination, pay or cause to be paid their
respective Allocated Portion of such Indebtedness/Leakage True-Up Amount by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated within
two (2) Business Days following such final determination to the Seller
Representative in writing by Buyer.

Section 1.6 Seller Representative. (a) Each Seller hereby constitutes and
appoints Tiptree, in its capacity as the Seller Representative, to act as its
representative for all purposes under the Transaction Agreements, and the
Seller Representative hereby accepts such appointment. Each Seller hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints, with full power of substitution, the
Seller Representative as its true and lawful attorney‑in‑fact, with full power
and authority in such Seller's name, to take all actions required or permitted
to be taken hereunder, and otherwise to act on behalf of, and to bind, each
Seller for all purposes under the Transaction Agreements, including (i)

hereby and thereby as the Seller Representative, in its sole discretion, may
deem necessary or desirable, (iv) refraining from enforcing any right of any
Seller and/or the Seller Representative arising out of or under or in any
manner relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement; provided
that no such failure to act on the part of the Seller Representative, except
as otherwise expressly provided in the applicable Transaction Agreement, shall
be deemed a waiver of any such right or interest by the Seller Representative
or by such Seller unless such waiver is in writing signed by the waiving party
or by the Seller Representative and (v) making, executing, acknowledging and
delivering all such other agreements, guarantees, orders, receipts,
endorsements, notices, requests, instructions, certificates, stock powers,
letters and other writings, and, in general, to do any and all things and to
take any and all action that the Representative, in its sole and absolute
discretion, may consider necessary or proper or convenient in connection with
or to carry out the transactions contemplated by this



Agreement, the Transaction Agreements and all other agreements, documents or
instruments referred to herein or therein or executed in connection herewith
and therewith. Without limiting the foregoing, (i) each Seller hereby
expressly consents to the amendment of the Shareholders Agreement by and among
PFG and its shareholders party thereto, dated as of December 16, 2010 (the
"Shareholders Agreement"), to the extent reasonably required to facilitate the
transactions contemplated hereby (provided that the foregoing consent to amend
such Shareholders Agreement shall not apply to any amendment that would have a
disproportionate material adverse effect upon any individual Seller as
compared to the effect thereof on the other Sellers hereunder), and (ii) each
Seller hereby agrees to cause the Articles of Incorporation of the Company,
dated August 5, 1999 and as amended on July 12, 2012, to be amended prior to
the Closing to delete the last sentence of the definition of "Sale
Transaction" provided for in Article VI, Section F therein. Each Seller agrees
to deliver, as and when requested by the Seller Representative, certificates
evidencing such Seller's Purchased Shares duly endorsed or accompanied by
written instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Seller
Representative, duly executed by such Seller, free and clear of any liens or
other adverse claims or restrictions (other than the RGA Liens), and to
appoint the Seller Representative as the custodian of such Purchased Shares
for purposes of the Closing, with full power to deliver such Purchased Shares
to the Buyer at Closing, whether or not such Purchased Shares are certificated
or held of record in book entry form. Each Seller agrees to cooperate fully
in, take all necessary and desirable actions approved by the Seller
Representative in connection with, and not to take any action prejudicial or
inconsistent with, the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In furtherance of this Section 1.6, each of the Sellers (i) hereby
irrevocably grants to, and appoints the Seller Representative and its
designees as its irrevocable proxy and attorney-in-fact (with full power of
substitution and resubstitution) to vote the Shares, provide written consents,
express consent or dissent or otherwise utilize voting power in accordance
with the Seller Representative's rights and obligations under this Section 1.6
during the term hereof, (ii) hereby affirms that the irrevocable proxy set
forth in this Section 1.6(b) is given in connection with the execution of this
Agreement, and that such irrevocable proxy is given to secure the performance
of the duties of such Seller under this Agreement and (iii) hereby (A) affirms
that such irrevocable proxy is coupled with an interest and (B) affirms that
such irrevocable proxy is executed and intended to be irrevocable in
accordance with the provisions of Section 1759 of the General Association Act
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Each Seller hereby represents that all
proxies, powers of attorney, instructions or other requests given by such
Seller prior to the execution of this Agreement in respect of the voting of
the Shares held by such Seller, if any, are not irrevocable and each Seller
hereby revokes (or causes to be revoked) any and all previous proxies, powers
of attorney, instructions or other requests with respect to the Shares. The
vote, if any, of the proxy holder pursuant to the proxy set forth in this
Section 1.6 shall control the outcome, and be determinative, of any conflict
between the vote by the proxy holder of any Seller's Shares and a vote by such
Seller. Each Seller shall provide evidence



to the Seller Representative in connection with the actions of such Seller
under or relating to this Section 1.6(b) as the Seller Representative shall
reasonably request.

(c) Each Seller acknowledges that this Section 1.6 is intended to promote the
efficient negotiation and handling of matters arising under or in connection
with the Transaction Agreements. Buyer shall be entitled to rely upon, without
independent investigation, any act, notice, instruction or communication from
the Seller Representative and shall not be liable in any manner whatsoever for
any action taken or not taken in reliance upon the actions taken or not taken
or communications or writings given or executed by the Seller Representative.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Seller hereby
irrevocably constitutes and appoints, with full power of substitution, the
Seller Representative as its true and lawful attorney-in-fact, with full power
and authority in such Seller's name, place and stead, to execute, certify,
acknowledge, deliver, file and record all agreements, certificates,
instruments and other documents and any amendment thereto, and to take any
other action that the Seller Representative deems necessary or appropriate in
connection with Sellers' or the Seller Representative's obligations under the
Transaction Agreements and, at the Seller Representative's request, each
Seller shall evidence such power by execution of a separate certificate,
affidavit, power of attorney or other instrument in such form and substance as
may be reasonably requested by the Seller Representative. Each Seller's
appointment of the Seller Representative as its attorney-in-fact shall be
deemed to be a power coupled with an interest and shall survive the
incompetency, bankruptcy or dissolution of Sellers giving such power. In the
event of any conflict between this Section 1.6 and the Shareholders Agreement,
the provisions of this Section 1.6 shall prevail. The following arrangements
between Sellers and the Seller Representative are made in consideration of the
Seller Representative's acceptance of its appointment as the Seller
Representative.

(d) In the event that the Seller Representative becomes unable to perform its
responsibilities hereunder or resigns from such position, Sellers holding a
majority of the Preferred Stock immediately prior to the Closing shall select
another representative to fill such vacancy and such substituted
representative shall be deemed to be the Seller Representative for all
purposes under the Transaction Agreements.

(e) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Seller Representative in
accordance with the power and authority granted to it under the terms of this
Agreement shall be conclusive and binding upon all Sellers and shall be deemed
authorized, approved, ratified and confirmed by Sellers, having the same force
and effect as if performed pursuant to the direct authorization of such
Sellers, and no Seller shall have any cause of action against the Seller
Representative for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the
Seller Representative. The Seller Representative hereby agrees that any
exercise of the powers, authorities or rights granted to it by Sellers under
the terms of this Agreement shall



be consistent with and in furtherance of the agreements contained in this
Agreement, including the agreements of the Company Sellers set forth in
Section 1.10.

(f) Sellers agree, severally and not jointly, in accordance with their
respective Allocated Portion of the Purchase Price, to indemnify the Seller
Representative for, and to hold the Seller Representative harmless against,
any Losses incurred, arising out of or in connection with the Seller
Representative's carrying out its duties hereunder or under any other
Transaction Agreement, including costs and expenses of successfully defending
the Seller Representative against any claim of liability with respect thereto;
provided that Seller Representative shall not be entitled to indemnification
hereunder from any Seller to the extent such Losses are the result of the
Seller Representative's willful breach (as defined in Section 8.2), fraudulent
acts or omissions. The Seller Representative may consult with counsel of its
own choice and will have full and complete authorization and protection for
any action taken and suffered by it in good faith and in accordance with the
opinion of such counsel. The Seller Representative may deliver to the Sellers
from time to time a statement of costs, expenses and other Losses of the
Seller Representative subject to indemnification by the Sellers hereunder,
divided among the Sellers in accordance with their Allocated Portions and,
upon receipt thereof, each Seller shall promptly (and in any event within five
(5) Business Days of receipt thereof) remit its allocated amount to the Seller
Representative in the manner indicated in such statement; provided that in no
event shall any Seller's aggregate indemnification obligation under this
Section 1.6(f) exceed the aggregate proceeds that such Seller would have
received had the transactions contemplated hereby been consummated on the
terms and conditions set forth herein. In addition, the Seller Representative
may, at its sole election, offset from any amounts received hereunder for
distribution to the Sellers the amount of any Losses for which the Seller
Representative is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 1.6(f)
and use such amounts to satisfy all or any portion of such indemnification
obligations of the Sellers. The indemnity obligations of this Section 1.6(f)
shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of the Seller
Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

(g) The provisions of this Section 1.6 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees,
and successors of each Seller, and any references in this Agreement to a
Seller shall mean and include the successors to such Seller's rights
hereunder, whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the laws of descent
and distribution or otherwise.

(h) The Seller Representative, in its capacity as such, hereby represents and
warrants to Buyer, as of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as
follows:

(i) Organizational Status. The Seller Representative is a limited liability
company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the

cause the Transferred Companies to give, Buyer, its financial advisers,
actuaries, auditors and other authorized representatives and agents reasonable
access during normal business hours upon prior notice to (i) all of the
offices, properties, Books and Records of the Transferred Companies and to all
of the books and records of Sellers relating to the Transferred Companies;
(ii) such financial and operating data and other information relating to the
Transferred Companies as such Persons may reasonably request; and (iii) the
employees and financial advisors of Sellers or the Transferred Companies whose
assistance and expertise are necessary to assist Buyer in connection with
Buyer's investigation of the Transferred Companies and Buyer's preparation to
transition the Transferred Companies and their business and personnel into
Buyer's ownership and operation following the Closing; provided that in no
event shall Sellers or their Affiliates be required to provide access to any
such records and information to the extent that they contain information that
is subject to an attorney-client or other legal privilege. Any investigation
pursuant to this Section 5.4(a) shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of Sellers or the
Transferred Companies.

(g) After the Closing, each Seller and their Affiliates shall hold, and shall
cause their Representatives to hold, in confidence, unless required to
disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of
Law, all (i) written, oral or other information concerning the Transferred
Companies and (ii) this Agreement and the





Transaction Agreements and any written, oral or other information related to
the negotiation hereof and thereof ("Transaction Confidential Information",
and together with (i), "Buyer Confidential Information"), except to the extent
that any such Buyer Confidential Information can be shown to have been (x)
previously known on a nonconfidential basis by the Person to which such Buyer
Confidential Information was disclosed, (y) generally available in the public
domain other than as a result of any act or omission by Sellers or their
Affiliates or (z) later lawfully acquired by such Person on a non-confidential
basis and from a source (other than those related to its prior ownership of
the Transferred Companies or Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Companies) or representatives) that is not bound by an obligation
of confidentiality with respect to such information. The obligation of Sellers
and their Affiliates to hold any such information in confidence shall be
satisfied if they exercise the same care with respect to such information as
they would take to preserve the confidentiality of their own similar
information. If any Seller or Affiliate or Representative of Seller is
required to disclose by judicial or administrative process or by other
requirements of Law any Buyer Confidential Information, it shall give Buyer
prompt written notice of such requirement provide Buyer with prompt written
notice of such disclosure requirement so that Buyer may seek a protective
order or other remedy protecting such Buyer Confidential Information. In the
event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or Buyer
waives its right to seek such an order or remedy, the applicable Seller,
Affiliate or Representative shall be entitled to furnish only that portion of
such Buyer Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed
and shall exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurances
that appropriate confidential treatment will be accorded such Buyer
Confidential Information.

(h) From and after the Closing, the Seller Representative shall afford, and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates to
afford, to Buyer and its agents reasonable access during normal business hours
upon prior notice to its books and records, books of account, financial and
other records (including accountant's work papers), information, employees,
financial advisers, actuaries, auditors and other representatives and agents
to the extent necessary or useful for Buyer in connection with any audit,
investigation, dispute or litigation or any other reasonable business purpose
relating to any of the Transferred Companies; provided, that in no event shall
such Persons be required to provide access to any such records and information
to the extent that they contain information that is subject to an attorney-
client or other legal privilege; provided, further, that any such access by
Buyer shall not unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the business of
such Person.

(i) After the Closing, Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Transferred
Companies) shall hold, and shall cause their Representatives to hold, in
confidence, unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process
or by other requirements of Law, (i) written, oral or other information
concerning the Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Companies) and (ii) Transaction Confidential Information (together with





(i), the "Seller Confidential Information") except to the extent that such
information can be shown to have been (x) previously known on a
nonconfidential basis by the Person to which such Seller Confidential
Information was disclosed, (y) generally available in the public domain other
than as a result of any act or omission by Buyer or its Affiliates or (z)
later lawfully acquired by such Person on a non-confidential basis and from
sources other than those related to its acquisition and ownership of the
Transferred Companies. The obligation of Buyer and its Affiliates to hold any
such information in confidence shall be satisfied if they exercise the same
care with respect to such information as they would take to preserve the
confidentiality of their own similar information. If any Buyer or Affiliate or
Representative of Buyer is required to disclose by judicial or administrative
process or by other requirements of Law any Seller Confidential Information,
it shall give Seller prompt written notice of such requirement provide Seller
with prompt written notice of such disclosure requirement so that Seller may
seek a protective order or other remedy protecting such Buyer Confidential
Information. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, or Seller waives its right to seek such an order or remedy, the
applicable Buyer, Affiliate or Representative shall be entitled to furnish
only that portion of such Seller Confidential Information that is legally
required to be disclosed and shall exercise its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain assurances that appropriate confidential treatment will be
accorded such Seller Confidential Information.

(j) From and after the Closing, Buyer shall afford, and shall cause its
Affiliates to afford, to the Seller Representative and its agents reasonable
access during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice to its books
and records, books of account, financial and other records (including
accountant's work papers), information, employees, financial advisers,
actuaries, auditors and other representatives and agents to the extent
necessary or useful for the Seller Representative to address and respond to
any audit, investigation, dispute or litigation, or in connection with any
other reasonable business purpose, arising from or relating to a Seller's
prior ownership of any of the Transferred Companies; provided that in no event
shall such Persons be required to provide access to any such records and
information to the extent that they contain information that is subject to an
attorney-client or other legal privilege; provided, further, that any such
access by the Seller Representative pursuant to this Section 5.4(e) shall not
unreasonably interfere with the business operations of the Buyer or its
Affiliates.



Section 5.5 Subsequent Financial Statements. Sellers shall promptly deliver to
Buyer following the filing or preparation thereof, as applicable, true,
complete and correct copies of all audited and unaudited financial statements
of the types identified in Section 3.6 with respect to each of the Transferred
Companies between the date hereof and the Closing Date, and all statutory
statements of each of the Insurance Subsidiaries





prepared or filed by the Transferred Insurance Subsidiaries between the date
hereof and the Closing Date (all of which shall be timely filed with the
applicable Insurance Regulator in compliance with applicable Law), and all
such financial statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP or SAP, as
applicable, consistently applied. Each Seller hereby represents and warrants,
severally in accordance with its respective Allocated Portions and not
jointly, that, as of the Closing Date, the information about the Transferred
Companies included in any form, document or report filed or furnished by
Tiptree Financial Inc. with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the
Closing Date will comply in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder, as applicable, and as of their respective
dates will not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state
a material fact required to be stated therein to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

Section 5.6 Public Announcements. No party to this Agreement or any Affiliate
or Representative of such party shall issue or cause the publication of any
press release or public announcement or otherwise communicate with any news
media in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be
required by Law or applicable securities exchange rules, in which the case the
party required to publish such press release or public announcement shall
allow the other party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press
release or public announcement in advance of such publication and shall
consider in good faith such comments.

Section 5.7 Consents, Approvals and Filings.

(e) The Sellers and Buyer shall each use their commercially reasonable
efforts, and shall cooperate fully with each other to (i) comply with all
requirements of Governmental Authorities applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to seek to obtain as promptly as
practicable all Governmental Approvals necessary or advisable in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
Buyer shall not be obligated to comply with any condition imposed by a
Governmental Authority or in connection therewith which would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, assets,
liabilities, properties, condition (financial or otherwise), operations or
results of operations of Buyer or any of its Affiliates, or any requirement to
sell, divest, operate in a specified manner, hold separate or discontinue or
limit, before or after the Closing Date, any assets, liabilities, business,
operations or interest in any assets or business of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates or any of the Transferred Companies. The parties shall cooperate
with the reasonable requests of each other in seeking





to obtain as promptly as practicable all such Governmental Approvals. In
connection therewith, the parties shall make, and cause their respective
Affiliates to make, all filings required by applicable Laws as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof in order to facilitate prompt consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall provide and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide such information and
communications to Governmental Authorities as such Governmental Authorities
may request. Each of the parties shall provide to the other party copies of
all applications or other communications to Governmental Authorities in
connection with this Agreement in advance of the filing or submission thereof.

(f) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, but no later than twenty (20) Business Days
following the date hereof in the case of the Form A, the parties shall make
all filings and notifications with all Governmental Authorities that may be or
may become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under the Transaction
Agreements and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements, including Buyer
causing "Form A" or similar change of control applications to be filed in each
jurisdiction where required by applicable insurance Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by the Transaction Agreements.

(g) From and after the date hereof, the parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate fully with each other to obtain as
reasonably as practicable following the date hereof all required approvals,
consents, waivers or authorizations from Third Parties (other than any
Governmental Authority) required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Hartford
Acknowledgment (each, a "Third Party Consent"). Sellers or their Affiliates
shall be responsible for 100% of the costs (including any license or other
fees and expenses) associated with obtaining the consents from such Third
Parties or replacement of such rights. Without limiting the foregoing, in the
event a Third Party Consent other than the Hartford Acknowledgment has not
been obtained by the Closing Date, then each of the parties hereto shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to (A) provide Buyer and its Affiliates with rights or
access to the benefits provided under any such Contract for which an approval,
consent or waiver has not been obtained or substantially equivalent rights or
access until the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (B) without
limiting clause (A), enforce for the account of Buyer any rights of Sellers or
the Transferred Companies arising from such Contract. In addition, each of the
parties hereto shall continue to use their commercially reasonable efforts
after the Closing to obtain such Third Party Consents that have not been
received as of the Closing.

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither party
nor any of their respective Affiliates shall be required to disclose pursuant
to this Section 5.7 (1) any information that in the reasonable judgment of
such party would result





in the disclosure of any trade secrets of such party or Third Parties, (2) any
privileged information or confidential competitive information or (3) any
information to the other party or any of its Affiliates that in the reasonable
judgment of such non-disclosing party would violate any of its contractual
obligations with respect to confidentiality; provided, that with respect to
clause (3), the non-disclosing party shall have first used its reasonable best
efforts to obtain a waiver or consent necessary to allow it to disclose such
information; provided, further, that if such consent or waiver to disclose is
not obtained, the non-disclosing party shall provide such information directly
to the applicable Governmental Authority and may seek to have such information
treated confidentially.

Section 5.8 Resignations. Sellers shall deliver to Buyer letters of
resignation, effective as of the Closing, of all officers and directors of any
of the Transferred Companies set forth on Section 5.8 of the Buyer Disclosure
Letter.

Section 5.9 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates'
Representatives to, execute and deliver such additional instruments,
documents, conveyances or assurances and take such other actions as shall be
necessary, or otherwise reasonably be requested by any other party hereto to
confirm and assure the rights and obligations provided for in this Agreement
and render effective the consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby
and thereby, or otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes of this
Agreement.

Section 5.10 Consents and Waivers of Sellers.

(a) Each Seller agrees that the only amounts to which it is entitled in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby at and after the Closing

(ii) its Allocated Portion of any positive Additional Consideration, in each
case as contemplated by Section 1.7 and (iii) any amounts to which it is
entitled as a Seller Indemnitee pursuant to Article IX hereof.

matter of any nature, fixed or contingent, known or unknown, whether at law or
in equity, by reason of any event, occurrence, circumstance or matter of any
nature that occurred, arose or existed at any time on or before the Closing
Date, other than any claim for the amounts referred to in paragraph (a) of
this Section 5.10 and, with respect to Sellers who are Employees, for
compensation for service as an employee or director of any of the Transferred
Companies in accordance with the terms of such employment.





(c) Each Seller hereby waives, acknowledges and agrees that such Seller shall
not have and shall not attempt to exercise or assert, any right of
contribution or indemnity or any other claim whatsoever against any
Transferred Company or any officer or employee of any Transferred Company in
connection with any matter with respect to which indemnity is or may be sought
from the Sellers under the Transaction Agreements.

(d) Each Seller hereby waives any and all rights such Seller may have under
the Stockholders Agreement with respect to the transfer of the Shares to Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement and hereby agrees that, subject to the occurrence
of the Closing and effective on the Closing Date, the Stockholders Agreement
shall be terminated and be of no further force and effect.

Section 5.11 Financing.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, from the date hereof
until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms and the Closing Date, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange for Buyer to obtain
the proceeds of the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Financing Commitments (provided that Buyer may (x) amend, modify, supplement,
restate, assign, substitute or replace the Financing Commitments and any
related Fee Letter to add or replace lenders, collateral agents or similar
entities or (y) otherwise amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign,
substitute or replace or consent to any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, the Financing Commitments in a manner that would not (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the proceeds to Buyer of the Financing (including by
increasing the amount of fees to be paid or original issue discount), (ii)
reduce the amount of the Equity Financing unless (A) the Debt Financing is
increased by, or other sources of financing are available to Buyer in, a
corresponding amount no later than the date of such amendment, modification,
supplementation, restatement, assignment, substitution, replacement or waiver,
(B) such reduction is expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the Debt
Financing or other financing at such increased amount at the Closing, and (C)
after giving effect thereto, the representations in the sixth sentence of
Section 4.4 hereof remain accurate, (iii) impose new or additional conditions,
or expand any existing conditions, to the receipt of the proceeds of the
Financing or otherwise amend, modify, supplement, restate, assign, substitute,
replace or waive any other provision of the Financing Commitments, in each
case, in a manner that would reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or
make less likely to occur the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the
conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (iv) adversely affect the
ability of Buyer or the Seller Representative, as applicable, to enforce its
rights against other parties to the Equity Financing Commitments or the
definitive agreements relating to the Equity Financing), including using its
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) maintain in effect the





Financing Commitments in accordance with the terms and subject to the
conditions thereof (subject to Buyer's right to amend, modify, supplement,
restate, assign, substitute or replace the Financing Commitments in accordance
herewith), (B) satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the anticipated
timing of the satisfaction of the condition set forth in Section 7.1(b)) all
conditions applicable to Buyer's obtaining the Financing at the Closing set
forth therein to the extent within Buyer's control, (C) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on terms and
conditions no less favorable to Buyer than those described and contemplated by
the Financing Commitments and the Fee Letter (and, upon the reasonable request
of the Seller Representative, update the Seller Representative of the status
of its efforts to arrange the Financing), (D) upon the satisfaction or the
waiver of the conditions set forth in such definitive agreements and herein,
consummate the financing on the Closing Date, including using its (and causing
its controlled Affiliates to use) best efforts to cause the persons committed
to fund the Financing to so fund the Financing at the Closing and enforce its
rights under the Financing Commitments and the definitive agreements in
respect of the Debt Financing, including by seeking specific performance of
the parties thereunder as and only to the extent permitted under Section 11.10
and (E) comply in all material respects with its covenants and other
obligations under the Financing Commitments.

(b) Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative informed on a reasonably
current basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange
the Debt Financing and provide to the Seller Representative, upon request,
copies of the definitive agreements and any other material documents relating
to the Debt Financing. Buyer shall give the Seller Representative prompt
notice of (i) any termination of any Debt Financing Commitment, any definitive
agreement in respect of the Debt Financing or any portion of the Debt
Financing, (ii) any material breach, default, termination or repudiation of
any provisions of the Debt Financing Commitment or any material agreements
entered into in respect thereof by any party thereto, of which Buyer becomes
aware, and (iii) the receipt of any written notice or other written
communication from any party to any of the Financing Commitments with respect
to any material breach, default, termination or repudiation of any provisions
of the Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive agreements entered into in
respect thereof. In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Financing Commitments, Buyer
shall promptly notify Sellers and shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, arrange and obtain in replacement thereof,
and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount such that the
aggregate funds that would be available to Buyer at the Closing will be
sufficient to pay all amounts contemplated by this Agreement to be paid by it
at the Closing and to perform its obligations hereunder; provided that Buyer
shall not be required to arrange for or obtain any such alternative financing
on terms and conditions that are less favorable to Buyer and its Affiliates
than the terms contained in the Debt Financing Commitment and the Fee Letter.
Buyer shall promptly deliver to Sellers true, complete and correct copies of
all agreements





pursuant to which any such alternative source shall have committed to provide
Buyer with any portion of the Financing. For purposes of this Agreement,
references to "Financing," "Equity Financing" and "Debt Financing" shall
include the financing contemplated by the applicable Financing Commitments as
permitted or required by this Section 5.11 to be amended, modified,
supplemented, restated, assigned, substituted or replaced and references to
"Financing Commitments," "Equity Financing Commitment", "Debt Financing
Commitment" and "Fee Letter" shall include such documents as permitted or
required by this Section 5.11 to be amended, modified, supplemented, restated,
assigned, substituted or replaced, in each case from and after such amendment,
modification or replacement.

(c) Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall, and shall cause each of their
Affiliates (including the Transferred Companies) to, and shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause its and their representatives to,
provide to Buyer such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to
assist Buyer in causing the conditions in the Financing Commitments to be
satisfied and such cooperation as is otherwise necessary or reasonably
requested by Buyer in connection with Buyer's obtaining the Financing in
accordance with its terms. Such cooperation shall include: (i) granting the
Buyer's financing sources access to the Books and Records (including cash
management and accounting systems) and to any information about the
Transferred Companies and the Business as Buyer may reasonably request in
order to permit such Buyer's financing sources to conduct an appropriate due
diligence review of the Transferred Companies and the Business; (ii) making
available to Buyer and such Buyer's financing sources its and the Transferred
Companies' employees and representatives for participation in a customary and
reasonable number of meetings, presentations and due diligence sessions; (iii)
furnishing to Buyer and such Buyer's financing sources such financial
statements, financial data, audit reports and information as Buyer may
reasonably request; (iv) causing the Transferred Companies to execute and
deliver (or using reasonable best efforts to obtain from their advisors) such
documents, Contracts (including definitive financing documents, pledge
documents and security documents), certificates (including a solvency
certificate from the chief financial officer of the Transferred Companies),
legal opinions or other documents and instruments relating to guarantees and
other matters ancillary to the Financing as may be reasonably requested by the
Buyer, in each case to be effective as of or after the Closing, (v)
facilitating the pledging of, and the granting, recording and perfection of
security interests in, share certificates, securities and other collateral at
and after the Closing, (vi) causing the Transferred Companies to take such
corporate actions, effective as of or after the Closing, as shall be
reasonably requested by the Buyer to permit the consummation of the Financing
and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available at the Closing, (vii)
causing the Transferred Companies to deliver notices of prepayment,
termination or redemption within the time periods required by the relevant
agreements governing any existing Indebtedness of the Transferred Companies,
and obtaining customary payoff letters, prepayment notices, Lien terminations
and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing, to allow the payoff,
discharge and termination in full on the Closing Date of all existing
Indebtedness





of the Transferred Companies, and (viii) furnishing the Buyer and its
financing sources promptly with all documentation and other information which
any lender providing or arranging the Debt Financing has reasonably requested
and that such lender has determined is required by regulatory authorities in
connection with such Debt Financing under applicable "know your customer" and
anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including, without limitation,
the PATRIOT Act. Such requested cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere
with the ongoing operations of the Sellers or the Transferred Companies. In no
event shall the Sellers, the Transferred Companies or any of their respective
Subsidiaries be required to (1) bear any cost or expense, pay any fee, enter
into any definitive agreement or incur any other liability in connection with
the Debt Financing prior to the Closing, in each case, except to the extent
covered by the Buyer's obligations pursuant to the terms of the immediately
following sentence, (2) except for the prepayment, termination or redemption
notices described in clause (vii) of this Section 5.11(c) and documents
delivered pursuant to clause (viii) of this Section 5.11(c), enter into any
definitive agreement in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing or (3) take any actions to the extent such actions would unreasonably
interfere with the ongoing business or operations of the Sellers or the
Transferred Companies. Buyer shall promptly, upon request by the Seller
Representative, reimburse the Sellers for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Sellers or
any of their respective Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives in
connection with the Debt Financing, including the cooperation of the Sellers,
the Transferred Companies and their respective Subsidiaries and
Representatives contemplated by this Section 5.11, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Sellers and their Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by
any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing and any
information used in connection therewith, except to the extent any of the
foregoing arise from (i) the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or
material breach of this Agreement by, the Sellers, the Transferred Companies
or their respective Subsidiaries or (ii) historical information provided,
directly or indirectly, by the Sellers, the Transferred Companies or their
respective Subsidiaries that was requested by Buyer or any of its
Representatives or Financing Sources in connection with the arrangement of the
Debt Financing. Sellers shall keep confidential and not disclose to any Person
(other than their representatives, on a need-to-know basis and in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby), the Debt Finacning Commitment, the
Fee Letter or the terms thereof, without prior written consent of the Buyer,
except as such Seller may be required to disclose any such information by
judicial or administrative process or by other requirements of Law.

Section 5.12 Exercise of Warrants. At least five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing (or at such earlier time as any Warrant Holder so elects), each
Warrant Holder will exercise each of the Warrants held by such Warrant Holder,
and (if applicable) each IRA Seller will cause its related IRA that holds
Warrants to exercise each of the Warrants held by such IRA, in each case by
surrendering each such Warrant to the Company with the





exercise form attached thereto duly completed and executed. Each such Warrant
shall be exercised on a "net exercise" basis, with the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such exercise reduced by that number of shares of
Common Stock having a Fair Market Value (as defined in the applicable Warrant)
equal to the aggregate Warrant Price (as defined in the applicable Warrant)
for the shares of Common Stock being purchased. Each Seller acknowledges and
agrees that each share of Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the
Warrants held by such Warrant Holder will be a Share for all purposes of this
Agreement, and each Warrant Holder and each applicable IRA Seller shall direct
the Company to issue such Shares into the custody of the Seller Representative
as if the Seller Representative had requested such delivery pursuant to
Section 1.6 hereof.

Section 5.13 Termination of Affiliate Transactions; Intercompany Balances.
Except as set forth on Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, take such actions as may be
necessary to terminate, prior to the Closing, all Affiliate Transactions, and
Sellers shall ensure that none of the Transferred Companies that are parties
thereto shall incur any liability in connection with such termination. Except
as set forth in Section 5.13 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, Sellers shall
cause all receivables and payables between any Transferred Company, on the one
hand, and any Seller or any Affiliate of any Seller (other than the
Transferred Companies), on the other hand, to be settled or extinguished prior
to the Closing.

Section 5.14 Non-Compete; Non-Solicitation.

(g) Non-compete. For a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date, Tiptree
shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled Affiliates (whether now
existing or existing subsequent to the date of this Agreement) to, directly or
indirectly, conduct, operate, control, manage, participate, own, invest in or
otherwise engage in, any business engaged in the sale or administration of
corporate owned life insurance products, bank owned life insurance products or
similar insurance products, as conducted as of the date of this Agreement or
as of the Closing Date, in any geographical jurisdiction in which the Business
operates as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date (a
"Competing Business"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section
5.14(a) shall prohibit (x) Tiptree or its Affiliates from owning or investing
in not more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of any publicly traded
company, so long as Tiptree or the applicable Affiliate does not have any
representative, designee or nominee on the board of directors (or equivalent
body) of such company and does not actively participate in the business of
such company or (y) Tiptree or its Affiliates from (i) selling any of its
assets or businesses to a Person engaged in lines of business that compete
with the Competing Business; (ii) managing or controlling investment funds
that make investments in Persons engaging in a Competing Business, so long as
such investments are in the ordinary course of business and not for the
account of





any such Person; or (iii) providing investment management and similar services
to any Person engaging in a Competing Business.

(h) Non-Solicitation of Employees. For a period of two (2) years after the
Closing Date, Tiptree shall not, and shall not permit any of its controlled
Affiliates (whether now existing or existing subsequent to the date of this
Agreement) to, directly or indirectly, for its own benefit or the benefit of
any other Person, solicit or attempt to solicit, or induce or attempt to
induce, or employ or hire (as an employee or independent contractor), any
current Employee of the Transferred Companies to leave his or her employment
with Buyer, the Transferred Companies or their respective Affiliates or
successors in interest. The restrictions in this Section 5.14(b) shall cease
to apply to any Employee six months after the date of termination of his or
her employment with Buyer, the Transferred Companies or their respective
Affiliates or successors in interest, provided that such Employee has not
terminated his or her employment at the encouragement of Tiptree or any of its
Affiliates. Nothing in this Section 5.14(b) shall restrict or preclude Tiptree
or any of its Affiliates from making generalized searches for employees by the
use of advertisements in the media or by engaging search firms that are not
instructed to solicit any of the current Employees.

(i) The parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 5.14 are
reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve Buyer's legitimate business
interests and the value of the Business, the Transferred Companies and the
Shares. Tiptree further acknowledges and agrees that Buyer's agreements
contained in this Agreement, including its agreements to acquire the Shares
indirectly owned by Tiptree, are being entered into by Buyer in exchange for
and reliance upon the agreements of Tiptree contained in this Section 5.14.
Tiptree acknowledges and agrees that the remedy of indemnity payments pursuant
to Article X and the other remedies at law for any breach of the requirements
of this Section 5.14 would be inadequate, and agrees and consents that without
intending to limit any additional remedies that may be available, temporary
and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief may be granted without
proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy, in any proceeding which
may be brought to enforce any of the provisions of this Section 5.14.

(j) If, at the time of enforcement of the agreements contained in this Section
5.14, a court shall hold that the duration or scope stated herein are
unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the
maximum duration and scope reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration and scope and that the court shall be
allowed and directed to revise the restrictions contained herein to cover the
maximum scope and duration permitted by applicable Law.

(k) Sellers shall pay, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees for, from and against any and all Taxes and other Losses in
respect of Taxes that (i) are imposed on or with respect to the Transferred
Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, and, without duplication, any
interest, penalty or additions to Tax accruing after the Closing Date on Taxes
described in this clause (i), (ii) arise under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6 or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law by virtue of
the Transferred Companies having been a member of a consolidated, combined,
affiliated, unitary or other similar tax group prior to the Closing, (iii) are
imposed by reason of the Transferred Companies having liability for Taxes of
another Person arising under principles of transferee or successor liability
or by contract as a result of transactions taking place prior to the Closing,
and (iv) resulting from an inclusion under Section 951 of the Code by any
Transferred Company at the end of the taxable year of any Transferred
Subsidiary that is a controlled foreign corporation (as defined under Section
957 of the Code) that includes the Closing Date to the extent such inclusion
results from any transactions or activities occurring between the beginning of
the taxable year of such controlled foreign corporation that includes the
Closing Date and through the Closing, in each of the above cases, to the
extent such Taxes exceed the accrual in respect thereof shown on the Closing
Statement as finally determined; provided, that, Sellers shall not be liable
or otherwise be required to pay, reimburse, indemnify or hold harmless Buyer
Indemnitees for, from and against any Taxes (or any other Losses in respect of
Taxes) with respect to any (x) transaction of Buyer or any of its Affiliates
not in the ordinary course of business that occurs on the Closing Date but
after the Closing, (y), filing of any amended Tax Return or change in any Tax
election or accounting method with respect to the Transferred Companies
relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period after the Closing Date by Buyer, any of
its Affiliates, or any transferee of Buyer or its Affiliates or (z)
transactions pursuant to the Buyer Restructuring. The amount of any payments
required to be made pursuant to this Section 6.1 shall be computed (i) without
regard to any net operating loss, net capital loss or other Tax deduction,
credit or benefit that is attributable to, arises from or relates to any Post-
Closing Tax Period and (ii) assuming that any income or gain attributable to
the Buyer Restructuring is allocated to a Post Closing Tax Period (including
pursuant to Section 6.1(c)). To the extent permitted by Law, Buyer shall elect
to carry forward any net operating loss, net capital loss or other Tax assets
generated in a Post-Closing Tax Period. For the avoidance of doubt, the
limitations described in Sections 9.4(a) and (b) shall not apply to this
Section 6.1(a).

(l) The Seller Representative shall be responsible for (i) preparing and
filing (or causing to be prepared and filed) all Tax Returns with respect to
the Transferred Companies that are due prior to the Closing Date and (ii)
causing the Transferred Companies to pay all Taxes of or with respect to the
Transferred Companies reflected on such Tax Returns that become due and
payable prior to the end of the day on the Closing Date, in each case, within
the time and in the manner prescribed by Law. All such Tax Returns shall





be prepared and filed in accordance with past practices and the requirements
of this Agreement, except as required by applicable Law.

(m) Buyer shall be responsible for (i) preparing and filing (or causing to be
prepared and filed) all Tax Returns with respect to the Transferred Companies
for Pre-Closing Periods that are due after the Closing Date and all Straddle
Period Tax Returns and (ii) causing all Taxes with respect to such Tax Returns
to be paid, in each case, within the time and in the manner prescribed by Law.
All such Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in accordance with past
practices and the requirements of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. Sellers will reimburse Buyer for Taxes reflected on such Tax
Returns within ten (10) days after such Tax Returns are filed to the extent
that such Taxes are indemnifiable by Sellers under Section 6.1(a). The
preparation and filing of any Tax Return that does not relate to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period or a Straddle Period shall be exclusively within the control of
Buyer.

(n) Each of the Seller Representative, on one hand, and Buyer, on the other
hand, shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make any Tax Returns and
work papers in respect of Pre-Closing Tax Periods and Straddle Periods for
which such party is responsible for preparing available for review by the
other party sufficiently in advance of the due date for filing such Tax
Returns (after taking into account available extensions), but in all events at
least thirty (30) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be
filed, to provide such other party with a meaningful opportunity to analyze,
comment on and dispute such Tax Returns and for such Tax Returns to be
modified, as appropriate, before filing. With respect to any Tax Returns for
Pre-Closing Tax Periods prepared by Buyer, Buyer shall reflect any reasonable
comments made by Sellers. In the event of any disagreement between Buyer and
Seller Representative, such disagreement shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountant, and any such determination by the Independent Accountant shall be
final unless otherwise not consistent with a determination (as defined in
Section 1313(a) of the Code). The fees and expenses incurred pursuant to this
Article VI of the Independent Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand.

(o) For purposes of this Section 6.1, any liability for Taxes attributable to
a Taxable Period that begins before and ends after the Closing Date (a
"Straddle Period") shall be apportioned between the portion of such period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning on the day after the
Closing Date (i) in the case of real and personal property Taxes, by
apportioning such Taxes on a per diem basis, (ii) in the case of Taxes based
upon an amount of premiums, the amount of Tax imposed based upon the amount of
premiums written or deposits made as of and including the Closing, and (iii)
in the case of all other Taxes, on the basis of a closing of the books as of
the end of day on the Closing Date.





(p) After the Closing, Buyer and Sellers shall not, and shall not permit any
of their Affiliates to, amend any Tax Returns or change any Tax elections or
accounting methods with respect to the Transferred Companies relating to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent such amendment or change could reasonably
be expected to have a material cost to the other party, including the
Transferred Companies.



Section 6.2 Books and Records; Cooperation. The parties to this Agreement and
their respective Affiliates will provide each other with such cooperation and
information as the Buyer or Sellers reasonably may request of the other or
such Affiliates with respect to any Tax matter at the expense of the
requesting Party (unless such expense is a Loss for which an indemnity is
due), provided that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties.

Section 6.3 Transfer Taxes. All Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be borne equally between
Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand; provided that any
Transfer Taxes resulting from the Buyer Restructuring shall be solely for the
account of the Buyer.

Section 6.4 Refunds. All refunds, credits or offsets of Taxes (including
interest actually received thereon from a relevant taxing authority) for which
Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 6.1(a) or Section 9.2 (other than
to the extent such refund, credit or offset results from the carryback of a
Tax attribute of any Transferred Company generated in a Post-Closing Tax
Period or is reflected in the Closing Statement) shall be for the account of
Sellers, and Buyer shall promptly pay such amounts (less any net Taxes
incurred by Buyer, its Affiliates or the Transferred Companies in connection
with the receipt of such refund, credit, offset or interest) to Sellers if
such refunds, credits or offsets are received by Buyer or any Transferred
Company. Buyer shall be entitled to all other refunds, credits or offsets of
Taxes (including interest received thereon from a relevant taxing authority)
in respect of any Taxes of the Transferred Companies, and Sellers shall pay
such amounts to Buyer if such amounts are received by Sellers or any Affiliate
thereof (less any net Taxes incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates in
connection with the receipt of such refund, credit, offset or interest).

Section 6.5 Tax Contests. Each of the Seller Representative, on one hand, and
Buyer, on the other hand, shall promptly notify the other in writing upon
receipt by the Seller Representative, Buyer, any Transferred Company or any of
their Affiliates of notice of any Tax audits, examinations or assessments that
could give rise to a liability for which the other party is





responsible under this Agreement, provided that failure to provide such notice
shall not limit the rights of such party under this Article VI except to the
extent the other party is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Seller
Representative shall control the portion of any such audit, examination or
proceeding that relates to any Taxes for which Sellers are responsible,
provided that the Seller Representative shall (i) keep Buyer regularly
informed as to the status of any such audit, examination or proceeding
(including by providing copies of all notices received from the relevant Tax
Authority), (ii) permit Buyer to participate in any such audit, examination or
proceeding at Buyer's expense and (iii) to the extent it could have an adverse
impact on Buyer or its Affiliates in a Post-Closing Tax Period, not settle or
compromise any such audit, examination or proceeding without the consent of
Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Buyer shall control
any audit, examination or proceeding (or portion thereof) that does not relate
to Taxes for which Sellers are responsible under Section 6.1(a) or Section
9.2.

Section 6.6 Tax Sharing Agreements. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall
terminate all Tax Sharing Agreements between any Transferred Company, on the
one hand, and any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates (other than the
Transferred Companies), on the other hand, such that no Transferred Company
shall have any obligations thereunder following the Closing.

Section 6.7 Overlap. To the extent of any inconsistency between Section 6.5
and Section 9.6, this Article VI shall control as to Tax matters.

ARTICLE VIII

TERMINATION

Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing Date:





(n) by the written agreement of Buyer and the Seller Representative;

(o) by either Buyer or the Seller Representative by notice to the other party,
if:

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before July 31, 2015 (as
may be extended in accordance with this clause (b), the "End Date"); provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(b)(i)
shall not be available to any party whose breach of any provision of this
Agreement results in the failure of the Closing to be consummated by such
time; provided further, that if the Closing has not occurred by July 31, 2015
due solely to the failure of any Governmental Approval set forth in Section
3.2 of the Seller Disclosure Letter or Section 4.2 of the Buyer Disclosure
Letter to have been obtained as contemplated by Section 7.1(b), the End Date
shall be automatically extended to the date that is the last day of the month
that is three months after the month in which the End Date occurs; or

(ii) (A) there shall be any Law that permanently makes consummation of the
Closing illegal or otherwise prohibited or (B) any judgment, injunction, order
or decree of any Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction
permanently enjoining Buyer or Sellers from consummating the Closing is
entered and such judgment, injunction, judgment or order shall have become
final and nonappealable.

(p) by Buyer by notice to the Seller Representative, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of Sellers shall have
occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a) not to be
satisfied and such breach or failure shall not have been cured or eliminated
within thirty (30) days following receipt by the Seller Representative of
written notice thereof from Buyer or the End Date, whichever is earlier;
provided that Buyer will not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(c) if the Seller Representative could then terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or if Buyer is otherwise then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder;

(q) by the Seller Representative by notice to Buyer, if a breach of any
representation or warranty or failure to perform or comply with any covenant
or agreement set forth in this Agreement on the part of Buyer shall have
occurred that would cause the condition set forth in Section 7.3(a) not to be
satisfied and such breach or failure shall not have been cured or eliminated
within thirty (30) days following receipt by Buyer of written notice thereof
from the Seller Representative or the End Date, whichever is earlier; provided
that the Seller Representative will not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant





to Section 8.1(d) if the Seller Representative could then terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) or if any Seller is otherwise then in
material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements hereunder; or

(r) by the Seller Representative by notice to Buyer, if (i) all of the
conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.2 have been satisfied (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
each of which is at the time of such notice of termination capable of being
satisfied as if such time were the Closing), (ii) the Seller Representative
has irrevocably notified Buyer in writing (A) that all of the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 have been satisfied or waived (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but each
of which is at the time of such notice of termination capable of being
satisfied as if such time were the Closing), and (B) that Sellers are ready,
willing and able to consummate the Closing; and (iii) Buyer fails to
consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days following the date the
Closing was required by Section 1.3.





Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Section 8.1, this Agreement shall, except as expressly indicated in the last
sentence of this Section 8.2, become void and of no effect without liability
of any party (or any of its directors, officers, employees, stockholders,
Affiliates, agents, representatives or advisors) to the other parties hereto,
provided that no such termination shall relieve either party of liability for
fraud or any willful and material breach of this Agreement or for any
liability existing pursuant to the surviving provisions expressly indicated in
the last sentence of this Section 8.2. For purposes hereof, "willful and
material breach" means a material breach by a party to this Agreement as a
result of an action or failure to act by such party that such party knew would
result in a breach of this Agreement. The provisions of Section 1.6(d) (Seller
Representative Indemnification), Section 5.6 (Public Announcements), the
reimbursement and indemnification provisions of Section 5.11(c), this Section
8.2 (Termination), Section 8.3 (Termination Fee), Section 10.1 (Certain
Terms), Section 10.2 (Construction) and Article XI (Miscellaneous) shall
survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.1.

Section 8.3 Termination Fee.

(a) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Seller
Representative pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e) or is otherwise
terminated when terminable pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or Section 8.1(e), then
Buyer shall promptly, but in no event later than two (2) Business Days after
the date of such termination, pay or cause to be paid to Tiptree (in its
individual capacity, and not as Seller Representative hereunder) or its
designees





the Termination Fee (an amount equal to $10,000,000) (the "Termination Fee")
by wire transfer of same day funds (it being understood that in no event shall
Buyer be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion).
Solely for purposes of establishing the basis for the amount thereof, and
without in any way increasing the amount of the Termination Fee or expanding
the circumstances in which the Termination Fee is to be paid, it is agreed
that the Termination Fee is not a penalty, but rather is liquidated damages in
a reasonable amount that will compensate Sellers in the circumstances in which
the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this
Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
Buyer fails to effect the Closing or otherwise breaches this Agreement or
fails to perform hereunder, then, except as and only to the extent expressly
permitted by Section 11.10, Sellers' sole and exclusive remedy (whether at
law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against the Buyer Related
Parties in respect of this Agreement, any Contract executed in connection
herewith (including the Equity Financing Commitment, the Limited Guaranty and
the Debt Financing Commitment, but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement)
and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be to terminate
this Agreement in accordance with (and subject to the conditions of) this
Article VIII and collect, if due, the Termination Fee and any reimbursement or
indemnity obligations under Section 5.11(c) or Section 11.3 from Buyer or
pursuant to the Limited Guaranty from Guarantors, and upon payment of such
amounts in accordance with Section 5.11(c), Section 11.3 and this Section
8.3(b), except in connection with an order of specific performance as and only
to the extent provided in Section 11.10, (A) no Buyer Related Party shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, any Contract executed in connection herewith (including the Equity
Financing Commitment, the Limited Guaranty and the Debt Financing Commitment,
but excluding the Confidentiality Agreement) or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (B) neither Sellers nor any other Seller
Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action,
proceeding or other Litigation against Buyer or any other Buyer Related Party
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, any Contract executed in
connection herewith (including the Equity Financing Commitment, the Limited
Guaranty and the Debt Financing Commitment, but excluding the Confidentiality
Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination, and (C) Sellers and the Seller Representative shall use their
reasonable best efforts to cause any claim, action, proceeding or other
Litigation pending in connection with this Agreement, any Contract executed in
connection herewith (including the Equity Financing Commitment, the Limited
Guaranty and the Debt Financing Commitment, but excluding the Confidentiality
Agreement) or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to the
extent maintained by Sellers or another Seller Related Party against Buyer





or any other Buyer Related Party, to be dismissed with prejudice promptly
following the payment of any such amounts. For the avoidance of doubt, (x)
under no circumstances shall Sellers (directly or through the Seller
Representative) be entitled to collect the Termination Fee on more than one
occasion and (y) under no circumstances shall Sellers (directly or through the
Seller Representative) be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of
specific performance of the obligation to close contemplated by Section 11.10
that results in the Closing occurring and any money damages, including the
Termination Fee. In connection with any loss suffered as a result of any
breach of any representation, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the
failure of the Closing to be consummated, or in respect of any oral
representation made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith, in
each case, other than in a circumstance in which the Seller Representative is
permitted to terminate this Agreement and cause Tiptree or its designee to
receive the Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3 or any reimbursement
or indemnity obligations under Section 5.11(c), Section 11.3 or the Limited
Guaranty, Sellers agrees that the maximum aggregate liability of Buyer shall
be limited to an amount equal to the amount of the Termination Fee plus any
reimbursement or indemnity obligations under Section 5.11(c), Section 11.3 and
the Limited Guaranty, and in no event shall Sellers (directly or through the
Seller Representative) seek to recover any money damages in excess of such
amount. In no event shall Sellers (directly or through the Seller
Representative) seek equitable relief or to recover monetary damages from any
Buyer Related Party in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than (i) Buyer pursuant to (and subject to the conditions of)
this Agreement and (ii) monetary damages from Guarantors pursuant to (and
subject to the conditions of) the Limited Guaranty.

(c) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section are
an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement.

ARTICLE IX

contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing until the
date that is eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date (the "Survival

(other than Section 3.17(i), (k) and (l)) shall survive for the applicable
statute of limitations plus sixty (60) days and the representations and

and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement that by their terms
are required to be satisfied or complied with prior to the Closing shall for
purposes of this Article IX survive the Closing until the eighteen (18) month
anniversary of the Closing Date. The covenants and agreements of the parties
contained in this Agreement that by their terms are required to be satisfied
or complied with after the Closing shall survive the Closing in accordance
with their respective terms. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement for Losses arising as a result of an
inaccuracy or breach thereof shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentences with respect to any
particular claim for indemnification thereunder, if written notice of the
inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such claim for indemnification
shall have been given to the party against whom such indemnity may be sought
prior to such time in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article
IX.

Section 9.2 Indemnification by Sellers.

(d) Subject to Section 9.2(b), Sellers shall, severally and not jointly,
defend, indemnify and hold harmless each of Buyer, its Affiliates, and, after

directors, employees, agents, advisers, successors and permitted assigns and
representatives (collectively, the "Buyer Indemnitees") from and against, and
pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnitees for, any and all losses, liabilities,
damages, costs, out-of-pocket expenses (including reasonable expenses of
investigation, enforcement and collection and reasonable attorneys' and
accountants' fees and expenses in connection with any Litigation), whether or
not involving a third-party claim, interest, penalties and regulatory fines,
settlements and consents to judgment, and judicial awards and judgments,
(collectively, "Losses"), resulting from or arising out of (i) any inaccuracy
in or breach of any representation or warranty made by any Seller in Article
II hereof, (ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Sellers (or by Tiptree with respect to PHAC) in Article III
hereof, (iii) any breach of any covenant or agreement, nonfulfillment or
default in the performance of any of the covenants and agreements of such
Seller under this Agreement, (iv) any Controlled Group Liability, or (v) any

(e) Any amounts required to be paid by any Seller pursuant to this Article IX
shall be satisfied in the following manner: (A) with respect to the
satisfaction of indemnification obligations arising pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(i), the obligation shall be considered the sole obligation of the
individual Seller that breached the applicable representation and warranty in
Article II, or if multiple Sellers so breached, the several but not joint
obligation of all such Sellers, apportioned based on their relative Allocated
Portions, (B) with respect to the satisfaction of indemnification obligations
arising pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii) and Section 9.2(a)(iii), the
obligations of Sellers shall be considered several and





not joint, apportioned among all Sellers based on their relative Allocated
Portions; provided that, as among the Sellers, non-breaching Sellers may seek
recovery from breaching Sellers (but not the Seller Representative, in its
capacity as such) for Losses incurred pursuant to this Article IX.



Section 9.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer shall defend, indemnify and hold
harmless Sellers and Sellers' respective officers, directors, employees,
agents, advisers, successors and permitted assigns and representatives

representation or warranty made by Buyer in Article IV hereof or in any
certificate or instrument delivered pursuant hereto or (b) any breach of any
covenant or agreement, nonfulfillment or default in the performance of any of
the covenants and agreements of the Buyer under this Agreement.

Section 9.4 Certain Limitations.

(d) After the Closing, except with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of
the Seller Fundamental Representations and without limiting the provisions of
Section 6.1(a), Sellers shall not be required to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees
(i) for Losses under Section 9.2(a)(i) and Section 9.2(a)(ii) until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds $1,500,000 (the "Deductible"), in
which event Sellers shall be responsible only for Losses in excess of the
Deductible, or (ii) for Losses under Section 9.2(a)(i) and Section 9.2(a)(ii)
in the aggregate in excess of an amount equal to 12.9% of the Closing Cash

the proceeds paid to the IRAs).

(e) After the Closing, except with respect to inaccuracies in or breaches of
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 4.1 (Corporate
Status), 4.2 (Corporate and Governmental Authorization) and 4.8 (Finders'
Fees) (the "Buyer Fundamental Representations"), Buyer shall not be required
to indemnify Seller Indemnitees (i) for Losses under Section 9.3(a) until the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds the Deductible, in which event
Buyer shall be responsible only for Losses in excess of such Deductible, or
(ii) for Losses in excess of the Cap.

(f) For purposes of this Article IX, with respect to any inaccuracy or breach
of any representation or warranty, any express qualifications or limitations
set forth in such representation or warranty as to "materiality", "Material
Adverse Effect" and similar materiality qualifications contained therein shall
be disregarded solely for purposes of





determining the amount of Losses of the applicable Indemnified Party's in
respect of such breach or inaccuracy, but not for purposes of establishing
whether the representation or warranty as made by the applicable party or
parties to this Agreement was actually inaccurate or breached.

(g) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Indemnified Party
shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of
this Agreement for any amount to the extent such Person or its Affiliates has
been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of
this Agreement.

(h) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach.

(i) Except as provided in Section 11.10, the indemnities provided for in
Article VI and this Article IX shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer
Indemnitees or Seller Indemnitees, as the case may be, after the Closing for
any inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of Sellers or Buyer,
respectively, herein or any other breach of this Agreement; provided that
nothing herein shall limit in any way any such party's remedies in respect of
fraud or willful breach (as defined in Section 8.2) by the other party in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

(j) No party to this Agreement (or any of its Affiliates) shall, in any event,
be liable or otherwise responsible to any other party (or any of its
Affiliates) for any punitive damages, lost profits, diminution of value or
consequential, special or indirect damages of such other party (or any of its
Affiliates) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the performance or
breach hereof, other than any such damages arising in connection with a Third
Party Claim; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall be
liable hereunder for lost profits and consequential damages to the extent they
are (i) not based on any special circumstances of the Indemnified Party not
actually known to the Sellers, (ii) the natural, probable and reasonably
foreseeable result of the event that gave rise thereto or the matter for which
indemnification is sought hereunder and (iii) resulting from breaches or
inaccuracies of the representations and warranties in Section 3.17(i), (k) and
(l)).

(k) In no event will any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates have any
liability hereunder in respect of the Losses of any Person to the extent such
Losses result from or arise out of the Buyer Restructuring and would not have
been incurred by any Person but for the Buyer Restructuring. For the avoidance
of doubt, subject to the foregoing sentence, the consummation of the Buyer
Restructuring shall not limit the Buyer





Indemnitees' right to indemnification under Section 9.2, and the Buyer
Indemnitees shall be entitled to indemnification of their Losses to the same
extent that such indemnification would have been available had the Buyer
Restructuring not occurred.

(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, none of the
limitations in this Section 9.4 shall apply in the event of any fraud or
willful breach on the part of any of the parties.

(m) The rights of Buyer to indemnification or any other remedy under this
Agreement shall not be impacted or limited by any knowledge that Buyer may
have acquired, or could have acquired, whether before or after the Closing
Date, nor by any investigation or diligence by Buyer. Sellers hereby
acknowledge that, regardless of any investigation made (or not made) by or on
behalf of Buyer, and regardless of the results of any such investigation,
Buyer has entered into this transaction in express reliance upon the
representations and warranties of Sellers made in this Agreement.



Section 9.5 Payment Adjustments.

(f) Any indemnity payment made by Sellers to Buyer Indemnitees, on the one
hand, or by Buyer to Seller Indemnities, on the other hand, pursuant to this
Article IX in respect of any Loss shall be net of an amount equal to (x) any
insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Party in respect of
such claim minus (y) any related costs and expenses, including the aggregate
cost of pursuing any related insurance claims plus any related increases in
insurance premiums or other chargebacks. If an Indemnified Party receives any
amounts under applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged
to be responsible for any Losses, subsequent to an indemnification payment by
the Indemnifying Party, then such Indemnified Party shall promptly reimburse
the Indemnifying Party for any payment made or expense incurred by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with providing such indemnification payment
up to the amount received by the Indemnified Party, net of any expenses
incurred by such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount.

(g) Any Loss suffered or incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller
Indemnitees for which an indemnification claim is made under this Agreement
shall be (i) net of, and reduced by the amount of any reduction in Taxes
actually realized by the indemnified party during the period ending two (2)
years following the end of the Tax year in which such Loss was incurred
(determined on a "with and without" basis) ("Tax Benefit") and (ii) shall be
increased by any increase in Taxes actually realized by the indemnified party
during the period ending two (2) years following the end of the Tax year in
which such Loss was incurred (determined on a "with and without" basis) as a
result of its entitlement to indemnification ("Tax Detriment"); provided, for
the avoidance of doubt, that a Tax





Detriment shall not include any increase in Taxes arising out of an
indemnification payment treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price as
provided under Section 9.5(c). If the indemnified party receives a Tax Benefit
or Tax Detriment after it has already received an indemnification payment on
account of its claim, then the indemnifying party or indemnified party, as
applicable, shall promptly thereafter make a corrective payment.

(h) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated for tax purposes as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

Section 9.6 Third Party Claim Procedures. In the case of any Litigation
asserted by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") against a party entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnified Party"), notice shall be
given by the Indemnified Party to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified
Party has written notice of such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnified Party
shall permit the Indemnifying Party (at the expense of such Indemnifying
Party) to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim; provided that (a)
counsel for the Indemnifying Party who shall conduct the defense of such Third
Party Claim shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified Party's
expense, and (b) the failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as
provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligation under this Agreement except to the such
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced as a result of such failure to
give notice. If the Indemnifying Party does not promptly assume the defense of
such Third Party Claim following notice thereof, the Indemnified Party shall
be entitled to assume and control such defense without prejudice to the
ability of the Indemnified Party to enforce its claim for indemnification
against the Indemnifying Party hereunder. Except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, no Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any
such Third Party Claim, shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into
any settlement that provides for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief
affecting the Indemnified Party or that does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified
Party of an irrevocable release from all liability with respect to such Third
Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party have
conflicting (or substantially divergent) interests in respect of the matter at
issue, or (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have the right to take over and
control the defense, settlement, negotiation or Litigation relating to any
such Third Party Claim, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the reasonable
fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party's counsel in respect thereof;
provided that if the Indemnified Party does so take over and control, the
Indemnified Party shall not settle such Third Party Claim without the written
consent of the Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. In any event, Sellers, and Buyer shall
cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim subject to this Article IX
and the records of each shall be reasonably available to the other with
respect to such defense. This Section 9.6 shall not apply to Third Party
Claims in respect of Taxes, which shall be governed by Section 6.5.





Section 9.7 Other Claims. A claim for indemnification to the extent not
resulting from a Third Party Claim may be asserted by written notice to the
party from whom indemnification is sought and, unless disputed by the
Indemnifying Party by delivery of a written dispute notice to the party
seeking indemnification within sixty (60) days after receipt by the
Indemnifying Party of such claim for indemnification, shall be deemed agreed
by all parties, final and undisputed and shall be paid by any such
Indemnifying Party promptly, but in no even more than thirty (30) days after
receipt of such undisputed claim for indemnification.

Section 9.8 Duty to Mitigate. Nothing herein shall relieve an Indemnified
Party of its common-law duty to mitigate Losses.

Section 9.9 Escrow Account.

(h) From the Closing Date until the date that is the later to occur of (i) the
date that is the earlier of (x) three (3) years following the Closing Date and
(y) the Early Termination Date and (ii) the date on which any and all claims
by the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification under this Article IX have been
fully and finally resolved, if Tiptree proposes at any time to declare or pay
a dividend, make a distribution or otherwise undertake any action that would
reasonably be expected to result in the consolidated stockholders' equity of
Tiptree (determined in accordance with GAAP) being less than $200 million,
then, prior to authorizing or taking any such action, Tiptree and Buyer will
enter into an escrow agreement with an escrow agent reasonably acceptable to
Tiptree and Buyer, which agreement shall be on terms reasonably acceptable to
Tiptree and Buyer. The escrow agreement shall provide that (i) if the escrow
agreement is executed prior to the date that is the earlier of (x) three (3)
years following the Closing Date and (y) the Early Termination Date, then upon
execution of the escrow agreement, Tiptree will deposit into an escrow account
with such escrow agent an amount of cash equal to the Cap, less any amounts
actually paid by Tiptree prior to the execution date in respect of
indemnification obligations pursuant to Sections 9.2(a)(i) or (ii) hereof;
(ii) if the escrow agreement is executed on or after the date that is the
earlier of (x) three (3) years following the Closing Date and (y) the Early
Termination Date, then upon execution of the escrow agreement, Tiptree will
deposit into an escrow account with such escrow agent an amount of cash equal
to the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer Indemnitees pursuant to pending
claims for indemnification as of the execution date; (iii) the escrowed funds
shall not be released (except to satisfy indemnification obligations owed to
the Buyer Indemnitees under this Agreement or as contemplated by Section
9.9(b)) until any and all claims by the Buyer Indemnitees for indemnification
under this Article IX have been fully and finally resolved, provided that,
upon the date that is the earlier of (i) three (3) years following the Closing
Date and (ii) the Early Termination Date, the balance of the escrowed funds
shall be reduced to equal the aggregate amount claimed by the Buyer
Indemnitees pursuant to pending claims for indemnification as of such date;
and (iv) the escrow account, while in existence, will be the first source of
recovery by the Buyer Indemnitees of any amounts subject to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) or (ii) hereof and payable by Tiptree.

(i) Tiptree's obligations under Section 9.9(a) shall immediately terminate and
become null and void, and any escrow agreement entered into pursuant thereto
shall terminate and





all amounts held in escrow pursuant to such escrow agreement shall be returned
and released to Tiptree promptly upon the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August
11, 2014, by and among Tiptree, Caroline Holdings LLC and Fortegra Financial
Corporation.

LAW SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402). Each of the parties hereby irrevocably submit
to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the federal
courts of the United States of America located in the State, City and County
of New York solely in respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the
provisions of this Agreement and of the documents referred to in this

Each of the parties irrevocably agrees that all claims in respect of the
interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of the
documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, or with respect to any such action or
proceeding, shall be heard and determined in such a New York State or federal
court, and that such jurisdiction of such courts with respect thereto shall be

agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document or in respect of
any such transaction, that it is not subject to such jurisdiction. Each of the
parties hereby waives, and agrees not to assert, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document or in respect of
any such transaction, that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought
or is not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement or any such document may not be enforced in
or by such courts. Each of the parties hereby consents to and grants any such
court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and over the subject matter
of any such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 11.1 or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be

THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY
OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH, OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF SUCH OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS
AND HAS CONSIDERED THE





IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.5.

Section 11.6 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs,
successors and permitted assigns; provided that except as permitted below,
this Agreement shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by any
Seller, on the one hand, without the prior written consent of Buyer, or by
Buyer without the prior written consent of the Seller Representative.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Seller Party, Buyer
may transfer or assign (including by way of a pledge), in whole or from time
to time in part, (a) to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to purchase
all or a portion of the Purchased Shares, (b) if applicable, to an Affiliate
of Buyer that purchases the equity interests of the Transferred Subsidiaries
(other than PFASC Holdings) as contemplated by Section 1.9, or (c) to its
lenders or other financing sources any or all of its rights hereunder
(including its rights to seek indemnification hereunder) as collateral
security; provided that, in the case of clauses (a), (b) and (c), no such
transfer or assignment will relieve Buyer of its obligations hereunder. Upon
any such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Buyer shall
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

Section 11.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the other Transaction Agreement
(when executed and delivered) and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof.

Section 11.8 Severability. If any provision, including any phrase, sentence,
clause, section or subsection, of this Agreement is determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be invalid, inoperative or unenforceable for any
reason, such circumstances shall not have the effect of rendering such
provision in question invalid, inoperative or unenforceable in any other case
or circumstance, or of rendering any other provision herein contained invalid,
inoperative, or unenforceable to any extent whatsoever. Upon any such
determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as
possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated
hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

Section 11.9 Counterparts; Effectiveness; Third Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, each of which shall be
deemed an original and all of which shall together constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall become effective when each party shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties. Until and
unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party,
this Agreement shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or
obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement
or other communication). Each party may deliver its signed counterpart of this
Agreement





to the other parties by means of electronic mail or any other electronic
medium utilizing image scan technology, and such delivery will have the same
legal effect as hand delivery of an originally executed counterpart. Except as
provided under Article IX, no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

Section 11.10 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage for which monetary relief, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement is not
performed in accordance with the specific terms hereof or is otherwise
breached. Accordingly, the parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the
valid termination of this agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, but
subject to Section 8.3(b) and Section 8.3(c) and the following sentence of
this Section 11.10, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in Section 11.4, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, however, the
parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Sellers shall be entitled to
specific performance to cause Buyer to draw down the full proceeds of the
Equity Financing pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Equity Financing
Commitment and to cause Buyer to effect the Closing in accordance with Section
1.2, in each case, only if (i) all conditions in Section 7.1 and Section 7.2
have been satisfied (other than those conditions that, by their nature, are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but each of which is at the time Sellers seek
specific performance pursuant to this Section 11.10 capable of being satisfied
as if such time were the Closing) or the failure of which to be satisfied is
attributable primarily to a breach by Buyer of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement), (ii) the
Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded at the date the Closing is
required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2 upon delivery of a drawdown
notice by Buyer and/or notice from Buyer that the Equity Financing will be
funded at such date, (iii) Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to Section 1.2, (iv) the Seller
Representative has confirmed in writing to Buyer that all conditions set forth
in Section 7.3 have been satisfied or that the Seller Representative on behalf
of Sellers would be willing to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 7.3
for purposes of consummating the Closing and (v) such specific performance
would result in the consummation of the Closing in accordance with this
Agreement substantially contemporaneously with the consummation of the Debt
Financing and the Equity Financing. Each party hereto agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (i) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or
(ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity.
