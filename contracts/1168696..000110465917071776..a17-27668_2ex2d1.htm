NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, the

with and into the Company at the Effective Time.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time of the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted herein and by Applicable Law)
of the conditions set forth in this Agreement, as soon as practicable on the
Closing Date, the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause a certificate of merger and any other appropriate documents (in any such
case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly prepared, executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and filed
with the Secretary of State. The Merger shall become effective upon the due

waived in accordance with this Agreement, or at such other date, time or place
as the parties hereto shall agree in writing; provided that, in no event shall
the Parent and US Holdco be obligated to effect the Closing until the date
that is twenty (20) Business Days following the date of receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, which shall be automatically extended, if and to the
extent, the Parent reasonably believes in good faith, based on the advice of
outside legal counsel and after consultation with the Company, that it is
required to supplement the Parent Shareholders Circular and provide additional
time for shareholders of the Parent to consider the information in the
supplement, provided that the duration of any such extension shall be the
minimum number of Business Days which the Parent Board reasonably believes in
good faith, based on advice of outside legal counsel, is required by the

circulate the supplementary prospectus or circular and for the shareholders of
the Parent to consider such supplementary prospectus or circular.

 



 

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time (a) the separate existence
of the Merger Sub shall cease, the Merger Sub shall be merged with and into
the Company and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Corporation in the
Merger, (b) the certificate of incorporation of the Company as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and restated in its
entirety to read as set forth on Exhibit A, and as so amended and restated
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter further amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL, and (c)
the bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be amended and restated in their entirety to read as set forth on
Exhibit B, and as so amended and restated shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter further amended in accordance with their terms,
the terms of the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
and the DGCL. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of
the DGCL and in this Agreement.

 



 

1.5 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. The parties shall
take all requisite action so that the directors of the Merger Sub immediately

Corporation, and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, in
each case to hold office in accordance with the term of office set forth in
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and until
their successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal.

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _TREATMENT OF COMPANY SECURITIES_

 



 

2.1 _Conversion of Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, the Merger Sub, US
Holdco, the Parent or the holder of any shares of the capital stock of the
Company or capital stock of the Merger Sub:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Capital Stock of the Merger Sub_. Each share of the common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. All shares of
Company Common Stock that are held in the treasury of the Company and any
shares of Company Common Stock owned by the Company, any Subsidiary of the
Company, the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub or any other Subsidiary of the
Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist and no consideration shall be paid or delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



 

(c) _Merger Consideration for Company Common Stock_. Subject to Section 2.2,
each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than shares to be cancelled in accordance with
Section 2.1(b) and any Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically converted
into the right to receive $23.00, without interest thereon (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time and upon the conversion thereof,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Section 2.1(c) in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.2.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this Section 2.1(d) shall be
construed to permit any party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited
or restricted by any other provision in this Agreement.

 



 

2.2 _Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Parent and US
Holdco shall enter into an agreement (in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to the Company) with the Paying Agent for the Paying Agent to act
as paying agent for the Merger and (ii) US Holdco shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than Dissenting Shares), for payment through the Paying Agent in
accordance with this Section 2.2, the Payment Fund. The Payment Fund shall not
be used for any purpose other than as set forth in this Section 2.2. The
Payment Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by US Holdco;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank

 



      
 

 



 

which are then publicly available); _provided_ , _however_ , that no gain or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable hereunder and US Holdco shall
take all actions necessary to ensure that the Payment Fund includes at all
times cash sufficient to satisfy US Holdcos obligation to pay the Merger
Consideration under this Agreement. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investments (net of any losses) shall be paid to US Holdco or the
Surviving Corporation, as US Holdco directs, pursuant to Section 2.2(e). In
the event the Payment Fund is diminished below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payments as required under Section 2.2(b),
including any such diminishment as a result of investment losses, US Holdco
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, immediately deposit
additional cash into the Payment Fund in an amount equal to the deficiency in
the amount required to make such payments.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 



 

(i) Promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall (1) be
prepared prior to the Closing, (2) specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent, and (3) otherwise be in such form and
have such provisions as the Parent and the Company may reasonably agree), and
(B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 2.2(g)) in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
2.2(g)) to the Paying Agent for cancellation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Surviving
Corporation or US Holdco shall cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as
promptly as reasonably practicable, a cash amount in immediately available
funds equal to (1) the number of shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 2.2(g)) multiplied by (2) the Merger Consideration, and
the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any holder of
Uncertificated Shares shall not be required to take any action (including
delivery of a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal) to receive the
Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this
Article II. The Surviving Corporation or US Holdco shall cause the Paying
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time
to each such holder of record as of the Effective Time the Merger
Consideration in respect of such Uncertificated Share, and such Uncertificated
Share shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(iii) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in good faith to establish customary procedures with the

 



      
 

 



 

Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") with the objective
that the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first
Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in cash from the Payment Fund in
immediately available funds, equal to (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares) held of record by DTC or
such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the
Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ ").

 



 

(c) _Interest; Transfers; Rights Following the Effective Time_. No interest
will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of such
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership
of a Certificate or Uncertificated Shares which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be paid to a
Person other than the Person in whose name the Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares is registered, if, in the case of a Certificate, such Certificate is
presented to the Paying Agent, and in each case the transferor provides to
Paying Agent (i) all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and (ii) evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Certificate and
all Uncertificated Shares (other than Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
representing Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by Section 2.1(c).

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender of Certificates and cancellation of
Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article II, subject to Section 2.2(e).

 



 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates and Uncertificated Shares
for one year after the Effective Time (including all interest and other income
received by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it)
shall be delivered to US Holdco, upon demand, and any holder of a Certificate
or Uncertificated Shares who has not previously complied with this Section 2.2
shall be entitled to receive only from US Holdco or the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) payment of its
claim for Merger Consideration, without interest.

 



 

(f) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, none of the

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company
Performance Share Award that is then outstanding and unvested shall vest with
respect to the target number of shares of Company Common Stock that could be

shares of Company Common Stock then underlying such Company Performance Share
Award multiplied by (ii) the Merger Consideration, without any interest

2.4 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to

entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of
Dissenting Shares (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to
exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the rights set forth in Section 262 under the DGCL), unless and until
such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn
or otherwise lost such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL.

 



 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (by the holder
thereof effectively withdrawing, failing to perfect, or otherwise losing such
holders appraisal rights under the DGCL with respect to such shares), then,
as of the later of the Effective Time or the date of loss of such status, such
shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective
Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with
Section 2.1, without interest, and shall not thereafter be deemed to be
Dissenting Shares.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give the Parent: (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or

unless the Parent shall have given its written consent to such payment or
settlement offer.

 



 

2.5 _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub, the

deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Company Common Stock or any other recipient of payments hereunder
any amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and timely
remitted by the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, to the applicable
Governmental Entity, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder or other recipient in respect of

wholly owned Subsidiary of the Parent formed solely for the purpose of
engaging in the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no

US Holdco formed solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, has engaged in no other business activities
and has conducted its operations only as contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.5 _Financing_. The Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Sub will have, upon
receipt of the Financing, as of the Effective Time, sufficient cash on hand
for the satisfaction of all of their obligations under this Agreement,
including (i) in the case of US Holdco, the payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration (and any repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated by, or
required in connection with the transactions described in, this Agreement, the
Underwriting Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters) and any other amounts
required to be

 



      
 

 



 

paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including all
amounts payable in respect of Company Restricted Shares and Company
Performance Share Awards under this Agreement and all related fees and
expenses of US Holdco) (collectively, the " _US Holdco Payment Obligations_
"); and (ii) in the case of the Parent, to pay all related fees and expenses
of the Parent and reimbursable expenses of the Company (collectively, the "
_Parent Payment Obligations_ "). The Parents, US Holdcos and the Merger
Subs obligations hereunder are not subject to a condition regarding the
Parents, US Holdcos or the Merger Subs obtaining of funds to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Parent has delivered to the
Company true and complete copies, including all exhibits and schedules
thereto, of (a) the executed Underwriting Agreement, pursuant to which
Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and Investec Bank plc have agreed to fully
underwrite the Rights Issue subject to the terms and conditions therein (the "
_Equity Financing_ ") and (b) the executed commitment letters and executed Fee
Letters (which Fee Letters have been redacted solely with respect to fee
amounts, original issue discount, "market flex" provisions, and other economic
terms; _provided_ , that such redactions do not relate to any terms that could
adversely affect the conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination
or aggregate principal amount (other than with respect to original issue
discount) of the Debt Financing or other funding being made available by such
Debt Financing Source), dated as of December 5, 2017 (collectively, the "
_Debt Commitment Letters_ " and, together with the Underwriting Agreement, the
" _Financing Documents_ "), from the Debt Financing Sources party thereto,
pursuant to which such Debt Financing Sources have agreed to provide, subject
to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth
therein (such debt financing, the " _Debt Financing_ " and, together with the
Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the " _Financing_ ") for
purposes of financing the Transactions and the related fees and expenses. As
of the date of this Agreement, (other than any amendments solely to add
lenders, arrangers, book-runners, syndication and documentation agents or
similar entities who have not executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the
date of this Agreement, assignments of the Parents and US Holdcos rights and
obligations under the Debt Commitment Letters to certain wholly owned
Subsidiaries of the Parent to the extent permitted thereunder (provided that
any such assignment shall not affect the liabilities or obligations of the
Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub hereunder and the Parent shall cause any
such assignee to perform any such obligations to the extent necessary to
preserve the original intent of the parties hereunder) and the Parents
entering into the Re-Pricing Memorandum as contemplated by the Underwriting
Agreement) none of the Financing Documents has been amended or modified, no
such amendment is contemplated, none of the respective obligations and
commitments contained in such letters have been withdrawn, terminated or
rescinded in any respect, and no such withdrawal, termination or rescission is
contemplated. The Parent or its applicable Subsidiary has fully paid any and
all commitment fees, underwriting fees or other fees in connection with the
Financing Documents that are payable on or prior to the date hereof and will
continue to pay in full any such amounts required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Financing Documents as and when they become due and payable on or
prior to the Closing Date. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with
the Financing Documents, the net proceeds contemplated by the Financing
Documents (after netting out applicable fees, expenses, original issue
discount, underwriting discount and similar premiums and charges and after
giving effect to the maximum amount of flex (including original issue discount
flex) provided under the Financing Documents), together with cash or cash
equivalents available to the Parent and its Subsidiaries, will in the
aggregate be sufficient for the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub and the
Surviving

 



      
 

 



 

Corporation to pay the aggregate Parent Payment Obligations and US Holdco
Payment Obligations, as applicable. As of the date hereof, the Financing
Documents are (x) legal, valid and binding obligations of the Parent and US
Holdco, and to the knowledge of the Parent and US Holdco, each of the other
parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their respective terms
against the Parent and US Holdco, as applicable, and, to the knowledge of the
Parent and US Holdco, each of the other parties thereto, in each case except
as such enforceability may be limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception
and (z) in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event,
development, circumstance or change has occurred which, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to
constitute a default or breach on the part of the Parent or US Holdco or, to
the knowledge of the Parent, any other parties thereto under the Underwriting
Agreement, or the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date of this Agreement,
the Parent does not have any reason to believe that it or any of the other
parties to the Financing Documents will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis
any term or condition of the Financing Documents required to be satisfied by
it, that the conditions thereof will not otherwise be satisfied or that the
full amount of the Financing will not be available on the Closing Date. The
only conditions precedent or other contingencies (including market "flex"
provisions) related to the obligations of Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc and
Investec Bank plc to underwrite the full amount of the Equity Financing and
the lenders to fund the full amount of the Debt Financing are those expressly
set forth in the Underwriting Agreement and the Debt Commitment Letter,
respectively. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no side letters or
other contracts or arrangements to which the Parent or any of its Affiliates
is a party related to the Financing other than as expressly contained in the
Financing Documents and delivered to the Company prior to the date hereof.

 



 

4.6 _Solvency_. None of the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub is entering
into this Agreement with the actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud either
present or future creditors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Assuming satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Parents, US Holdcos
and the Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving
effect to the Transactions, any alternative financing incurred in accordance
with Section 6.12 and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, any
other repayment or refinancing of debt contemplated in this Agreement or the
Financing Documents, payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection
with the consummation of the Transactions, and payment of all related fees and
expenses of the Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Sub, each of the Parent, US
Holdco and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent as of the Effective Time
and immediately after the consummation of the Transactions. For the purposes
of this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ ", when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the fair market value
of the assets of such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, at
a fair market valuation, will exceed the debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, of such Person and its Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis, (b) the present fair saleable value of the property of
such Person and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will be greater than
the amount that will be required to pay the probable liability of such Person
and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis on their debts and other
liabilities, direct, subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and
other liabilities become absolute and matured, (c) such Person and its
Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis will not have unreasonably small capital
with which to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged as such
businesses are now conducted and are proposed to be conducted

 



      
 

 



 

following the Closing Date and (d) such Person and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis will be able to pay their debts and liabilities, direct,
subordinated, contingent or otherwise, as such debts and liabilities become
absolute and matured.

 



 

4.7 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there is no action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending and of which the
Parent has been notified or, to the Parents knowledge, threatened against the
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no judgments,
orders or decrees outstanding against the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

4.8 _Other Agreements or Understandings_. There are no contracts, agreements
or other arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or
commitments to enter into contracts, agreements or other arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) (a) between the Parent, US Holdco,
the Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand, and any member of
the Companys management or the Company Board, on the other hand, (b) pursuant
to which any stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive
consideration of a different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration,
or (c) other than the Company Voting Agreement, pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or approve
the Merger.

 



 

4.9 _Brokers_. Except for Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, Investec Bank plc
and N.M. Rothschild and Sons Limited, no agent, broker, investment banker,
financial advisor or other firm or Person is or shall be entitled, as a result
of any action or agreement of the Parent or any of its Affiliates, to any
brokers, finders, financial advisors or other similar fee or commission in
connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

4.10 _No Other Representations or Warranties_. The Parent, US Holdco and the
Merger Sub further acknowledge and agree that, except for the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III (in each case as qualified and limited
by the Company Disclosure Schedule), (a) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Affiliates, stockholders or

implied representation or warranty with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective business or operations, including with

forth in this Agreement, had or has any duty or obligation to provide any
information to the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub or any of their
respective Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person,
in connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby or
otherwise, and (b) to the fullest extent permitted by law, none of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of its or their respective Affiliates,
stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person, will have or be subject
to any liability or indemnification or other obligation of any kind or nature
to the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub or any of their respective
Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person, resulting
from the delivery, dissemination or any other distribution to the Parent, US
Holdco, the Merger Sub or any of their respective

 



      
 

 



 

Affiliates, stockholders or Representatives, or any other Person, or the use
by the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub or any of their respective

 _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

 



 

6.1 _Go-Shop; No Solicitation by the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Go-Shop Period_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this Agreement and
continuing until midnight, New York time, on January 22, 2018 (i.e., one
minute after 11:59 p.m., New York time, on January 22, 2018) (the " _Go-Shop
Period_ "), the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall have the right to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit
or initiate Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers that may
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), including by way
of providing access to non-public information pursuant an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement; provided that the Company shall provide to the
Parent any material non-public information of the Company that is provided to
any such Person that was not previously made available to the Parent prior to,
or substantially concurrently with, the time it is provided to such Person,
and (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations with any Person with respect to Acquisition Proposals (or for the
purpose of encouraging or facilitating an Acquisition Proposal) and otherwise
cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any such inquiries,
proposals, offers, efforts, discussions or negotiations, but without sharing
any material non-public information unless the party has executed and
delivered to the Company an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. For purposes
of clarity, the Companys obligations under Section 6.1(b) shall commence with
respect to each Person upon the expiration of the Go-Shop Period unless the
Company Board or any committee or subcommittee thereof has determined that
such Person constitutes a Qualified Person prior to the expiration of the Go-
Shop Period. Promptly following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the
Company shall terminate all access of any Person (other than the Parent and
its Representatives and the Qualified Persons and their respective
Representatives) to any electronic data room maintained by, or on behalf of,
the Company with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and request each Person (other than the Parent and its Representatives and the
Qualified Persons and their respective Representatives) that has executed a
confidentiality agreement with the Company in connection with such Persons
consideration of making an Acquisition Proposal to promptly return or destroy
all non-public information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the
Company, subject to any record retention provisions set forth in such
confidentiality agreements.

 



 

(b) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Except as permitted under this Section
6.1 and except with respect to any Qualified Person, immediately following the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries and their Representatives to immediately cease any
solicitation, encouragement, discussions or negotiations with any Persons that
may be ongoing with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Except as permitted
under this Section 6.1 and except with respect to any Qualified Person,
following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause
its Representatives not to, directly or indirectly:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) other than informing Persons of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 6.1, enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person
any non-public information of the Company or access to its properties, books,
records or personnel for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating, any
Acquisition Proposal; or

 



 

(iii) grant any waiver or release under any standstill or similar agreement
with respect to any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to compliance with Section 6.1(e)(i)
and for so long as a Person continues to be a Qualified Person, at any time
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company, may
continue to (A) furnish information (including non-public information) with
respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to any Qualified Person (and the
Representatives of such Qualified Person), pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, provided that the Company shall provide to the
Parent any material non-public information of the Company that is provided to
any such Person that was not previously made available to the Parent prior to,
or substantially concurrently with, the time it is provided to such Person,
(B) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
(including solicitation of revised Acquisition Proposals) with any Qualified
Person (and the Representatives of such Qualified Person) regarding any
Acquisition Proposal, or (C) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Company Common Stock with
any Qualified Person for purposes of presenting a proposal to the Company
Board for consideration and negotiating thereafter with the Company Board.

 



 

(c) _Acquisition Proposal After the Go-Shop Period_. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Section 6.1, if at any time on or after the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
Representatives receives an Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of
Persons (that does not arise out of a material breach of Section 6.1(b) of
this Agreement), (i) the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify the terms and
conditions thereof and (ii) if the Company Board, or any committee thereof,
determines in good faith (1) after consultation with its financial advisors
and legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal, and (2) after
consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to take such actions set
forth in clauses (w), (x) or (y) below with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law,
then the Company, its Subsidiaries, and their Representatives may (w) furnish
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Acquisition Proposal (pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement),
provided that the Company shall provide to the Parent any material non-public
information that is provided to any such Person that was not previously made
available to the

 



      
 

 



 

Parent prior to, or substantially concurrently with, the time it is provided
to such Person, (x) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or
negotiations (including solicitation of revised Acquisition Proposals) with
the Person or group of Persons making such Acquisition Proposal and (y) amend,
or grant a waiver or release under, any standstill or similar agreement with
respect to any Company Common Stock with any such Person or group of Persons
who has made such Acquisition Proposal for purposes of presenting a proposal
to the Company Board for consideration and negotiating thereafter with the
Company Board.

 



 

(d) _No Change in Recommendation_.

 



 

(i) Except as set forth in this Section 6.1, (x) the Company Board shall not
withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or
modify in a manner adverse to the Parent, the Company Board Recommendation (a
" _Company Board Recommendation Change_ "), (y) the Company shall not enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement
providing for the consummation of a transaction contemplated by any
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in the circumstances referred to in Section 6.1(a), Section
6.1(b) or Section 6.1(c)), and (z) the Company Board shall not adopt, approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any
Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the
Company Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(1) if the Company has received a Superior Proposal, then the Company Board
may (x) effect a Company Board Recommendation Change with respect to such
Superior Proposal, or (y) authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(h) to enter into a definitive agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal, in each case if and only if:

 



 

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys financial advisors and legal counsel) that the failure to do so
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties pursuant to Applicable Law,

 



 

(B) such Acquisition Proposal is not the result of a material breach of
Section 6.1(b) or 6.1(c),

 



 

(C) the Company has notified the Parent in writing that it has received a
Superior Proposal and intends to enter into a definitive agreement or effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change relating to such Superior Proposal,
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal,
including a copy of the most current version of the proposed definitive
agreement to be entered with, and the identity of, the Persons or group of
Persons making the Acquisition Proposal (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (it
being understood that the

 



      
 

 



 

Superior Proposal Notice shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation
Change or a Trigger Event for purposes of this Agreement),

 



 

(D) if requested by the Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with the Parent and its Representatives during the four (4)
Business Day period immediately following delivery of the Superior Proposal
Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") with respect to the Parents proposed
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal (it being
understood that any material revision or amendment to the terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal (including any revision to the amount, form or mix
of consideration) shall be deemed to constitute a new Superior Proposal and
shall require a new Superior Proposal Notice, except that the Notice Period
with respect to such new Superior Proposal will be two (2) Business Days
instead of four (4) Business Days) immediately following delivery of the new
Superior Proposal Notice, and

 



 

(E) following the end of the Notice Period(s) referred to above, the Company
Board determines in good faith after consultation with its financial advisors
and legal counsel, and taking into account any modifications to this Agreement
proposed by the Parent prior to such time, that such Acquisition Proposal
continues to constitute a Superior Proposal, and that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law;

 



 

(2) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal that constitutes a
Superior Proposal, the Company Board may effect a Company Board Recommendation
Change in response to an Intervening Event if:

 



 

(A) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisors and legal counsel) that the failure to effect a
Company Board Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law,

 



 

(B) the Company has notified the Parent in writing at least four (4) Business
Days before effecting a Company Board Recommendation Change that it intends to
effect a Company Board Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event, describing in reasonable detail the underlying facts giving rise to,
and the reasons for making, such Company Board Recommendation Change (a "
_Recommendation Change Notice_ ") (it being understood that the Recommendation
Change Notice shall not constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change or a
Trigger Event for purposes of this Agreement),

 



 

(C) if requested by the Parent, the Company shall have engaged in good faith
negotiations with the Parent and its Representatives during the four (4)
Business Day period immediately following delivery by the Company to the
Parent of such Recommendation Change Notice with respect to adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

proposed by the Parent to obviate the need for a Company Board Recommendation
Change, and

 



 

(D) if the Parent shall have delivered to the Company a written, binding offer
to alter the terms or conditions of this Agreement during such four (4)
Business Day period, the Company Board shall have determined in good faith
(after consultation with its financial advisors and legal counsel), after
considering the modifications to this Agreement proposed by the Parent, that
the failure to effect a Company Board Recommendation Change would still be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) _Notices to the Parent_.

 



 

(i) Following expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall promptly
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days following the expiration of the
Go-Shop Period), advise the Parent in writing of the identity of each
Qualified Person from whom the Company received a written Acquisition Proposal
after the execution of this Agreement and prior to the expiration of the Go-
Shop Period, which notice shall include copies of drafts of proposed
agreements, term sheets or letters of intent related thereto provided to the
Company or any of its Representatives and a summary of the material terms of
all Acquisition Proposals by each Qualified Person that were not made in
writing.

 



 

(ii) Following expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall as promptly
as practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify the
Parent in writing (1) of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal after the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, which notice shall include the identity of
the Person(s) making, and a summary of the material terms of, such Acquisition
Proposal and copies of drafts of proposed agreements, term sheets or letters
of intent related thereto provided to the Company or any of its
Representatives, and (2) of any material written change to the terms and
conditions (including any written change to the amount, form or mix of
consideration) of any such Acquisition Proposal described in clause (1) above
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Acquisition Proposal involving a
Qualified Person), including revised copies of drafts of proposed agreements,
term sheets or letters of intent related thereto provided to the Company or
any of its Representatives.

 



 

(f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Company Board from (i) taking and
disclosing to its stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
or from issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its
position thereunder (which statement, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to
constitute a Company Board Recommendation Change), or (ii) making any
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with legal

 



       
 

 



 

counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with its obligations
under Applicable Law _provided_ , that if any such disclosure pursuant to this
clause (ii) has the substantive effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying
the Company Board Recommendation, such disclosure shall be deemed to be a
Company Board Recommendation Change for purposes of this Agreement (it being
understood that any "stop, look or listen" communication that contains only
the information set forth in Rule 14d-9(f) shall not be deemed, in and of
itself, to be a Company Board Recommendation Change).

 



 

6.2 _No Solicitation by the Parent_. Except as permitted under this Section
6.2, the Parent shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and their
Representatives to immediately cease any solicitation, encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Parent Acquisition Proposal. Except as permitted under this Section 6.2,
neither the Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and the Parent shall use
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly:

books, records or personnel for the purpose of encouraging or facilitating,
any Parent Acquisition Proposal; or

material breach of this Section 6.2), (i) the Parent, its Subsidiaries and
their Representatives may contact such Person or group of Persons to clarify
the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the Parent Board, or any
committee thereof, determines in good faith (1) after consultation with its
financial advisors and legal counsel that such Parent Acquisition Proposal
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Superior
Proposal, and (2) after consultation with legal counsel, that the failure to
take such actions set forth in clauses (w), (x) or (y) below with respect to
such Parent Acquisition Proposal would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under Applicable Law, then the Parent, its Subsidiaries, and their
Representatives may (w) furnish information (including non-public information)
with respect to the Parent and its Subsidiaries to the Person or group of
Persons who has made such Parent Acquisition Proposal (pursuant to a Parent
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement), (x) engage in or otherwise participate
in discussions or negotiations (including solicitation of revised Parent
Acquisition Proposals) with the Person or group of Persons making such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and (y) amend, or grant a waiver or release under, any
standstill or similar agreement with respect to any Parent capital stock with
any such Person or group of Persons who

otherwise requiring the Parent to abandon, terminate, materially delay or fail
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any action
described in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv), whether taken by the Parent, the
Parent Board or any committee thereof, being referred to as a " _Parent Board
Recommendation Change_ ").

 



 

(1) Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval, if the Parent has received a Parent Superior Proposal,
then the Parent Board may effect a Parent Board Recommendation Change with
respect to such Parent Superior Proposal, if and only if:

this Section 6.2 or Section 6.16,

 



 

(C) the Parent has notified the Company in writing that it has received a

assets, business, financial condition or results of operations of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and to the extent reasonably possible allow
representatives of the Parent an opportunity to share thoughts for the
Companys consideration; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
be required to permit any inspection or other access, or to disclose any
information, (x) except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in connection
with an Acquisition Proposal, Trigger Event, Recommendation Change Notice or
Superior Proposal Notice, (y) that would violate any legal requirement or
contractual obligation of the Company with respect to confidentiality or
privacy, including under any privacy policy ( _provided_ , that the Company
shall, upon the request of the Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain the required consent of any third party to such access or
disclosure), or (z) that would result in the loss of attorney-client privilege
or the attorney work product doctrine ( _provided_ , that the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to allow for such access or disclosure
in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege or the
attorney work product doctrine). Any such information shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the Closing, none of the Parent, US Holdco
or the Merger Sub shall (and each shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives not to) contact or communicate with any of the employees,
customers, licensors, distributors or suppliers of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

the parties and, as such, any failure to comply shall not be considered in
judging satisfaction of the condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.3(b)
of this Agreement.

that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to
pay any monies or agree to any material undertaking in connection with any of
the foregoing;

 



 

(iii) as promptly as practicable, make all necessary filings, and thereafter

the UKLA and the London Stock Exchange, and any other applicable federal,
state or foreign securities laws, (B) the HSR Act, any other applicable

permanent) (a " _Restrictive Order_ ") which has the effect of making the
Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

nothing contained in this Section 6.5(a) shall limit any obligation under any
other provision in this Section 6.5. and no party hereto shall be in violation
of this Agreement by virtue of providing information that is competitively
sensitive to one another on an "outside counsel only" or other basis designed
to ensure compliance with Applicable Law (including the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Laws).

 



 

(b) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 6.5,
each of the Parent and the Company shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable
and in any event within ten (10) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, if required, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and
Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions

 



      
 

 



 

contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) promptly make all filings as may be
required under any other applicable Antitrust Laws with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (to the extent required). None of
the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub or the Company shall commit to or agree
with any Governmental Entity to stay, toll or extend any applicable waiting
period under the HSR Act or other applicable Antitrust Laws or enter into a
timing agreement with any Governmental Entity, without the prior written
consent of the other parties.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms hereof, and without limiting the Parents obligations
under Section 6.5(d), the parties hereto shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Subsidiaries to, cooperate and use their respective reasonable best
efforts to obtain any government clearances or approvals required for the
Closing under any Antitrust Law, to respond to any government requests for
information under any Antitrust Law, to cause any waiting periods under any
applicable Antitrust Laws to expire or be terminated, and to contest and
resist any action, including any legislative, administrative or judicial
action, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Restrictive
Order. The parties hereto shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with, and
provide to the other parties in advance, any analyses, appearances,
presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and proposals made or
submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in connection with proceedings
under or relating to any Antitrust Law. To the extent permitted by law or
Governmental Entities reviewing the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the parties will provide each other the opportunity to participate
in meetings and other substantive conversations with any such Governmental
Entities.

 



 

(d) In furtherance of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.5, and
notwithstanding any limitations therein or elsewhere in this Agreement, the
Parent shall promptly take (and shall cause each of its Affiliates to take)
any and all actions necessary or advisable in order to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and obtain all approvals and consents under any Antitrust Laws that may
be required by any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental
Entity, in each case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including committing to, by consent decree or otherwise,
operational restrictions or limitations on, and committing to or effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, trust or otherwise, the sale, license,
disposition or holding separate of, such assets or businesses of the Parent,
US Holdco, the Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to decrees, judgments,
injunctions or orders of the relevant Governmental Entity) as may be required
to obtain such approvals or consents of such Governmental Entities or to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any decrees,
judgments, injunctions or orders that would otherwise have the effect of
preventing or delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Subject to the Parents prior written consent, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, the Company may make,
subject to the condition that the transactions contemplated hereby actually
occur, any undertakings (including undertakings to accept operational
restrictions or limitations or to make sales or other dispositions, _provided_
that such restrictions, limitations, sales or other dispositions are
conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby) as
are required to obtain such approvals or consents of such Governmental
Entities or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate
or lift, any decrees, judgments, injunctions or orders that would

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. None of the Parent, US Holdco or
the Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, through one or more of their
respective Affiliates, shall take any action, including acquiring or making
any investment in any person or any division or assets thereof, that would
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the satisfaction of any of the
conditions contained in Article VII or the consummation of the Merger or the
Rights Issue. Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Parent shall take
any and all actions necessary in order to ensure that (i) no requirement for
any non-action by or consent or approval of any foreign or U.S. federal, state
or local Governmental Entity with respect to any Antitrust Laws, (ii) no
Restrictive Order with respect to any Antitrust Laws and (iii) no other matter
relating to any Antitrust Laws would preclude consummation of the Merger prior
to the Outside Date. The foregoing notwithstanding, the Parent shall not be
required to make any material operational changes to address any governmental
investigation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any litigation
related to any alleged anticompetitive conduct of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, in each case that is ongoing as of the date of this Agreement.

 



 

6.6 _Public Disclosure_. The press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon
by the Company and the Parent. Except as may be required by law or stock
market regulations, and except as provided in Sections 6.1, 6.15 and 6.16, the
Parent and the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party before issuing any other press release
or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the Merger or this
Agreement; provided, however, that these restrictions shall not apply to any
Company or Parent communications (i) in connection with an Acquisition
Proposal, Trigger Event, Recommendation Change Notice or Superior Proposal
Notice (except as required under Section 6.1) or (ii) that are consistent in
all material respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or
public statements made by a party hereto in accordance with this Section 6.6,
including investor conference calls, filings with the SEC or UKLA, or QandAs or
other publicly disclosed documents. Nothing in this Section 6.6 shall limit
the ability of the Company or the Parent to make any internal announcements to
their respective employees that are consistent with the prior public
disclosures made in accordance with the terms of this Agreement regarding the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

6.7 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall, jointly and severally, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
each Indemnified Party against all claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses, including attorneys
fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Indemnified
Party is or was an officer, director, manager, employee or agent of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, while an officer, director or manager
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request of
the Company or one of its Subsidiaries as an officer, director, manager,
employee or agent of another Person, in each case in respect of acts or
omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to
the fullest extent permitted by law. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled
to

 



      
 

 



 

advancement of expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of
any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation from each of the
Parent and the Surviving Corporation within ten (10) Business Days of receipt
by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation from the Indemnified Party of a
request therefor; _provided_ that any Indemnified Party to whom expenses are
advanced provides a written undertaking to repay such advances if it is
determined by a final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction
(which determination is not subject to appeal) that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification under Applicable Law. The indemnification
agreements with the Companys directors and officers that survive the Merger
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.

 



 

(b) From the Effective Time through the six-year anniversary of the date on
which the Effective Time occurs, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation shall contain, and the Parent shall cause the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so
contain, provisions that are no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of individuals who,
at the Effective Time, were current or former directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries than are set forth in the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the date of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Subject to the next sentence, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i)
maintain, and the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at
no expense to the beneficiaries, in effect for six (6) years from the
Effective Time the Current DandO Insurance with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement), so long as the annual premium therefor would
not exceed the Maximum Premium, or (ii) purchase a Reporting Tail Endorsement
and maintain such endorsement in full force and effect for its full six (6)
year term. If the Companys or the Surviving Corporations existing insurance
expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period or exceeds the
Maximum Premium, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain, and the Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to obtain, as much directors and officers
liability insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an
annualized premium not in excess of the Maximum Premium, on terms and
conditions no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties than the Current
DandO Insurance. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a Reporting Tail
Endorsement, provided that the Company does not pay more than six times the
Maximum Premium for such Reporting Tail Endorsement. If a Reporting Tail
Endorsement has been purchased by the Company prior to the Effective Time, the
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Reporting Tail
Endorsement to be maintained in full force and effect for its full six (6)
year term and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

(d) In the event the Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of the Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
expressly assume and succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) If any Indemnified Party makes any claim for indemnification or
advancement of expenses under this Section 6.7 that is denied by the Parent
and/or the Company or the Surviving Corporation, and a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that the Indemnified Party is entitled to such
indemnification or advancement of expenses, then the Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation shall pay the Indemnified Partys costs and
expenses, including legal fees and expenses, incurred by the Indemnified Party
in connection with pursuing his or her claims to the fullest extent permitted
by law.

 



 

(f) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be in addition to the
rights otherwise available to any Indemnified Party by law, charter, statute,
bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their
representatives.

 



 

6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to the Parent (in any case within two (2) Business Days of discovery
thereof) of (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event,
development, circumstance or change which occurrence or failure to occur is
reasonably expected to cause any representation or warranty of such Person
(or, in case of the Parents obligation to provide notice, any representation
or warranty of US Holdco or the Merger Sub) contained in this Agreement to be
untrue or inaccurate (i) in the case of any representation or warranty of the
Company, in any manner that would result in the failure of the condition set
forth in Section 7.3(a) or (ii) in the case of any representation or warranty
of the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub, in any manner that would result in
the failure of the condition set forth in Section 7.2(a), (b) any material
failure by such Person (or, in case of the Parents obligation to provide
notice, any material breach by US Holdco or the Merger Sub) to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement set forth in this Agreement or
(c) any written notice or other written communication from any Governmental
Entity alleging that the Merger requires the consent or approval of such
Governmental Entity. The parties hereto agree that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 6.8 shall not, in and of itself, affect or be deemed
to modify any representation or warranty in this Agreement or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Transactions or the
remedies available to the parties hereunder.

 



 

6.9 _Employee Benefits Matters_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the foregoing, for a period of one (1) year following the
Effective Time, the Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, to each Company Employee who is employed immediately
prior to the Effective Time and who, upon the Effective Time, becomes an
employee of the Parent or remains an employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (each such individual, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) a total
compensation package no less favorable in the aggregate than the total
compensation package (including base salary, commissions and annual bonus
opportunities and value of annual equity awards) provided to such employee
immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits that
are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the other benefits provided
to such Continuing Employee immediately before the Effective Time (excluding
retiree benefits and defined benefit pension benefits). It is understood that
Parent need not provide equity awards provided they are replaced with an
equivalent benefit.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) The Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that
for purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and level of benefits (but
not for purposes of benefit accruals) under the New Benefit Plans, each
Continuing Employee will, subject to Applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, be credited with his or her years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the
Effective Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled,
before the Effective Time, to credit for such service under an analogous
Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that the foregoing shall
not apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, ensure that (i)
each Continuing Employee will be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any New Health Plan to the extent coverage under such New
Health Plan is of the same type as the coverage such Continuing Employee
received under an analogous Company Employee Plan immediately before the
Effective Time (such analogous Company Employee Plan, " _Old Health Plan_ "),
and (ii)(A) for purposes of each New Health Plan all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Health Plan be waived
for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such
conditions would not have been waived under the Old Health Plan and (B) any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
during the portion of the plan year of the Old Health Plan ending on the date
such employees participation in the corresponding New Health Plan begins be
taken into account under such New Health Plan for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Health Plan.

 



 

(c) The Parent shall provide each Continuing Employee who incurs a termination
of employment during the one-year period following the Effective Time with
severance payments and benefits that are equal to the severance payments and
benefits that would have been paid under the Companys severance practices as
in existence on the date of this Agreement and as set forth in the Employee
Benefit Plans included on Schedule 3.15(a).

 



 

(d) Except as provided in Section 10.4 hereof with respect to holders of
equity awards regarding the receipt of Merger Consideration hereunder, all
provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to employee benefit plans
or employee compensation are included for the sole benefit of the respective
parties and shall not create any right or remedy (including any third party
beneficiary rights) in any other Person, including any Continuing Employee,
current or former Company Employee or any participant or beneficiary in any
Company Employee Plan. Nothing in this Agreement shall (i) require the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries to continue to employ
any Continuing Employee following the Effective Time or to provide any right
to a particular term or condition of employment, (ii) require the Parent, the
Company, or any respective Subsidiary to continue any Company Employee Plan or
(iii) be construed to prohibit the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Subsidiaries from amending or terminating any employee benefit plan in
accordance with its terms or to amend or create any employee benefit plan or
any similar plan or agreement from the Parent or its Affiliates.

 



      
 

 



 

6.10 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "fair price," "business combination" or
"control share acquisition" statute or other similar statute or regulation is
or may become applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the Parent Irrevocable Undertakings or the Company Voting
Agreement, the parties hereto and their respective boards of directors shall
(a) grant such approvals and (b) take all such actions as are necessary to
eliminate or minimize the effects of any such statute or regulation on such
transactions.

 



 

6.11 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
such steps as may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by
Section 2.3 and any dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by each individual who is a director or officer of the Company
subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

6.12 _Financing_. (a) The Parent and US Holdco shall take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing on the terms and
subject only to the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set
forth in the Financing Documents, including taking all actions necessary to
(i) maintain in effect and comply with the Financing Documents, (ii) negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and subject to the conditions (including the market flex provisions) set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letters (or on other terms which do not (A)
reduce (or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of any
portion of the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be
paid or original issue discount other than as effected pursuant to any market
flex provisions expressly set forth in the Fee Letter) if such reduction would
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount needed to fund
the Parent Payment Obligations and the US Holdco Payment Obligations on the
Closing Date, (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing (or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any other provision of the Financing Documents), in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing)
on the Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of the Parent or US
Holdco to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing Documents
or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing), (iii) satisfy
(and cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions
applicable to the Parent and its Affiliates in the Financing Documents and the
definitive agreements related thereto (or, if necessary or deemed advisable by
the Parent, seek the waiver of conditions applicable to the Parent or its
applicable Subsidiary contained in such Financing Document or such definitive
agreements related thereto), (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the
time the Closing was required to occur pursuant to Section 1.3, including
using reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders, underwriters and the other
Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing, including to
cause the underwriters to procure subscribers for, and if such subscribers
cannot be procured, subscribe, any ordinary shares in the capital of the
Parent not properly subscribed and paid for in the Rights Issue in accordance
with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, (v) conduct the Rights Issue in
accordance with the Parent Shareholders Circular (or any amendment or
supplement thereto), (vi) enforce its rights under the Financing Documents and
the definitive agreements relating to the Financing, including enforcing the
Parents rights to compel GCH to acquire its full

 



      
 

 



 

entitlement under the terms of the Rights Issue pursuant to Section 3 of the
Parent Irrevocable Undertaking, dated the date hereof, between the Parent and
GCH, and (vii) comply with its covenants and other obligations under the
Financing Documents and the definitive agreements relating to the Financing.
The Parent and US Holdco shall not, and shall not permit any of their
Affiliates to, take any action that would constitute a breach of, or would
result in the termination of, any of the Financing Documents, in each case, in
a manner that could reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less
likely to occur the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date. The Parent
and US Holdco shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
agree to or permit any termination of or amendment, supplement or modification
to be made to, or grant any waiver of any provision under, the Financing
Documents or the definitive agreements relating to the Financing if such
termination, amendment, supplement, modification or waiver could (A) reduce
(or could have the effect of reducing) the aggregate amount of any portion of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount other than as effected pursuant to any market flex
provisions expressly set forth in the Fee Letter) if such reduction would
reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing below the amount needed to fund
the Parent Payment Obligations and the US Holdco Payment Obligations on the
Closing Date, (B) impose new or additional conditions precedent to the
availability of the Financing or otherwise expand, amend or modify any of the
conditions precedent to the Financing (or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any other provision of the Financing Documents), in a manner that could
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent or make less likely to occur the
funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing)
on the Closing Date or (C) adversely impact the ability of the Parent or US
Holdco to enforce its rights against other parties to the Financing Documents
or the definitive agreements with respect to the Financing; provided, that
notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Parent and US Holdco shall be permitted
to amend the Debt Commitment Letters solely to add lenders, arrangers, book-
runners, syndication and documentation agents or similar entities who have not
executed the Debt Commitment Letters as of the date of this Agreement, (y) the
Parent shall be permitted to enter into the Re-Pricing Memorandum as
contemplated by the Underwriting Agreement and (z) the Parent and US Holdco
shall be permitted to assign their rights and obligations under the Debt
Commitment Letters to certain wholly owned Subsidiaries of the Parent to the
extent permitted by the Debt Commitment Letters (provided that any such
assignment shall not affect the liabilities or obligations of the Parent, US
Holdco or the Merger Sub hereunder and the Parent shall cause any such
assignee to perform any such obligations to the extent necessary to preserve
the original intent of the parties hereunder). The Parent shall deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of any amendment, modification, supplement,
consent or waiver to or under any Financing Document or the definitive
agreements relating to the Financing as soon as reasonably practicable
following the execution thereof.

 



 

(b) The Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail, upon reasonable request by the Company, of the status of
its efforts to arrange the Financing and provide to the Company drafts
(reasonably in advance of execution) and thereafter complete, correct and
executed copies of the material definitive documents for the Financing
(provided that any draft or complete, correct and executed copies of Fee
Letters so provided may be redacted with respect to fee amounts, and "market
flex" provisions and other economic terms). The Parent and US Holdco shall
inform the Company as soon as reasonably practicable (i) of any actual breach
or default (or any event, development, circumstance or change that, with or
without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give

 



      
 

 



 

rise to any breach or default), termination, cancellation or repudiation by
any party to any of the Financing Documents or definitive documents related to
the Financing of which the Parent or US Holdco becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing source with respect to any (A) actual or alleged breach or default,
termination, cancellation or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing
Documents or any definitive document related to the Financing of any
provisions of the Financing Documents or any definitive document related to
the Financing or (B) material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to any of the Financing Documents or any definitive document related
to the Financing with respect to the conditionality or amount of the Financing
or the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing to be
funded at the Closing (but, in each case, excluding ordinary course
negotiations), and (iii) of the occurrence of an event, development,
circumstance or change that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact
the ability of the Parent or its Subsidiaries to obtain all or any portion of
the Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents on the terms and
conditions, in the manner and from the Financing Sources contemplated by any
of the Financing Documents or the definitive documents related to the
Financing (or if at any time for any other reason the Parent or US Holdco
believes that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Documents on the terms and conditions,
in the manner and from the Financing Sources contemplated by any of the
Financing Documents or the definitive documents related to the Financing)
necessary for the payment of the US Holdco Payment Obligations and the Parent
Payment Obligations on the Closing Date. As soon as reasonably practicable,
the Parent and US Holdco shall provide any additional information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence; provided that the Parent shall not be required
to provide any such additional information to the extent disclosure would be
prohibited under Applicable Law or such disclosure could reasonably be
expected to result in a waiver of attorney-client privilege (it being
understood that this proviso does not limit Parents and US Holdcos
obligations under immediately preceding sentence), provided that the Parent
and US Holdco shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
information in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege. If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions (including any applicable market flex provisions) contemplated
by the Financing Documents, and such portion is required to fund the Parent
Payment Obligations or the US Holdco Payment Obligations, the Parent shall
promptly notify the Company in writing and the Parent and US Holdco shall use
their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement thereof,
and negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to,
alternative financing from the same or alternative Financing sources in an
amount sufficient to fund the Parent Payment Obligations and the US Holdco
Payment Obligations on the Closing Date with terms and conditions (including
market flex provisions) not materially less favorable, taken as a whole, to
the Parent and US Holdco (or its Affiliates) than the terms and conditions set
forth in the Financing Documents, as promptly as practicable following the
occurrence of such event, development, circumstance or change. The Parent
shall deliver to the Company true and complete copies of all contracts,
agreements or other arrangements (including Fee Letters (which may be redacted
solely with respect to fee amounts, original issue discount, "market flex"
provisions and other economic terms; _provided_ , that such redactions do not
relate to any terms that could adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount (other
than with respect to original issue discount) of the Debt Financing or other
funding being made available by such Debt Financing

 



      
 

 



 

Source) pursuant to which any such alternative Financing source shall have
committed to provide any portion of the Financing. For purposes of this
Section 6.12, (x) references to the "Financing" shall include the financing
contemplated by the Financing Documents as permitted to be amended, modified,
supplemented or replaced in accordance with this Section 6.12, (y) references
to the "Financing Documents," the "Underwriting Agreement," and the "Debt
Commitment Letter" shall include such documents as permitted to be amended,
modified, supplemented or replaced by this Section 6.12 and (z) references to
"Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters as permitted to be amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced in accordance with this Section 6.12.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to provide, and to cause its Subsidiaries (and to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives) to provide, to the Parent and
US Holdco, in each case at the Parents or US Holdcos sole cost and expense,
such reasonable cooperation as is customary and reasonably requested by the
Parent or US Holdco in connection with the arrangement of the Financing,
including (i) upon reasonable request, the participation of senior officers in
a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, conference calls, drafting
sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with the Financing (in each case, at reasonably convenient times
and locations), (ii) using its reasonable best efforts to make available to
the Parent, its Subsidiaries, their advisors and their Debt Financing Sources,
such historical financial information and other information as the Parent or
US Holdco shall reasonably request of a type and form customarily included or
required in connection with (x) marketing materials for a senior secured bank
financing or (y) either a financing comparable to the Rights Issue conducted
in accordance with Applicable Law, including Section 4(a)(2), or a prospectus
or circular comparable to the Parent Shareholders Circular (or any amendment
or supplement thereto), including:

 



 

(i) any financial information and data derived from the historical books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is required to permit the
Parent, its Subsidiaries and their advisors to prepare the pro forma financial
statements required for the Parent Shareholders Circular (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) (provided that the Parent shall be responsible for the
preparation of any pro forma financial statements and pro forma adjustments
giving effect to the Merger and the Rights Issue for use in connection with
the offering of the Financing; provided, further, that in no event shall the
Company be required to provide (A) any information regarding any post-Closing
financial statements, or pro forma financial statements including post-Closing
financial statements or adjustments, or any post-Closing pro forma adjustments
desired to be incorporated into any information used in connection with the
Financing, including any synergies or cost savings, projections, ownership or
an as-adjusted capitalization table or any financial statements or information
not available to the Company or not prepared in the ordinary course of its
financial reporting practice or (B) any description of all or any component of
the Financing, including any such description to be included in liquidity and
capital resources disclosure, or other information customarily provided by the
Financing Sources or their counsel;

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) promptly correcting any information provided by or on behalf of it, or
which relates to the Company and the text of the disclosure thereof is
specifically approved in writing by the Company (including via email),
expressly for use in the Parent Shareholders Circular (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) if and to the extent that, to the Companys Knowledge,
such information shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
(or includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading) or as otherwise
required by Applicable Law, and the Parent and US Holdco agree to cause a

paid for by US Holdco and the Company shall not be responsible for the
delivery of the aforementioned documents prior to or at Closing, provided that
the Company shall procure delivery of officers certificates required to be
delivered by officers of the Company in connection with the redemption and
discharge).

 



 

(d) Such requested cooperation shall not, in the Companys reasonable
judgment, unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. In no event shall the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries be required to bear any cost or expense, pay any
commitment, underwriting or other fee, enter into any definitive agreement,
incur any other liability or obligation, make any other payment or agree to
provide any indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing
prior to the Effective Time. In addition, nothing in this Section 6.12 shall
require any action that would conflict with or violate the Companys or any
Subsidiarys organization documents in effect as of the date of this Agreement
or any Applicable Laws or result in, prior to the Effective Time, the
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in, prior to
the Effective Time, a violation or breach of, or default under, any material
contract to which the Company or

 



      
 

 



 

any of its Subsidiaries is a party. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective officers, directors (with
respect to any Subsidiary of the Company) or employees shall be required to
execute or enter into or perform any agreement with respect to the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Documents that is not contingent upon the
Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing and no directors of
the Company or any Subsidiary that will not be continuing directors, acting in
such capacity, shall be required to execute or enter into or perform any
agreement, or to pass any resolutions or consents, with respect to the
Financing. The Company hereby consents to the use of all logos of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing so long as such logos
(i)(a) are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) are
used solely in connection with a description of the Company, its business and
products or the transactions contemplated hereby or (ii) are used in any other
manner as approved by the Company. The Parent shall, upon request by the
Company from time to time prior to the Closing Date, promptly reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including (A)
reasonable attorneys fees and (B) fees and expenses of the Companys
accounting firms engaged to assist in connection with the Financing; provided,
that any Parent Termination Fee that may be payable pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of such payment to the extent,
but only to the extent, required by the Listing Rules) incurred by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives in
connection with the Financing, including the cooperation of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives prior to the
date of this Agreement and such cooperation contemplated by this Section 6.12
and the compliance by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives with its obligations under this Section 6.12, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in connection
with the arrangement of the Financing and any information used in connection
therewith (other than information supplied by or on behalf of the Company, or
which relates to the Company and the text of the disclosure thereof is
specifically approved in writing by the Company (including via email),
expressly for use in connection with the Financing), including compliance by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives with its obligations under this Section 6.12; provided,
however that the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of the Parent
shall not apply to the extent that the relevant amounts result from the
Companys or any of its Subsidiaries fraud or willful misconduct, in each
case, as determined by a final and non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction. Nothing contained in this Section 6.12 or otherwise
shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to be a borrower or
obligor with respect to the Financing prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(e) In no event shall the Parent or any of its Affiliates (which for purposes
of this Section 6.12(e) shall be deemed to include each direct or indirect
investor or potential investor in the Parent, GCH or any of the Parents,
GCHs or any such investors financing sources or potential financing sources
or other Representatives), without the prior written consent of the Company,
(i) award any agent, broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other
firm or person except HSBC Bank plc, Barclays Bank PLC, Investec Bank plc or
N.M. Rothschild and Sons Limited any financial advisory role on an exclusive
basis in connection with the Transactions or (ii) prohibit or seek to prohibit

 



      
 

 



 

any bank or investment bank or other potential provider of debt or equity
financing from providing or seeking to provide financing or financial advisory
services to any Person in connection with a transaction relating to the
Company or its Subsidiaries or in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

(f) The Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding the Companys obligations under Section 6.12(c), none of the
obtaining of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing, or the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing, is a
condition to the Closing, and reaffirm their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of
the availability of the Financing or any permitted alternative financing or
the completion of any such issuance, subject to the applicable conditions set
forth in Section 7.1 and Section 7.3.

 



 

(g) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by the Parent, US Holdco or any of their Representatives pursuant to
Section 6.12(c) above shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that, upon notice to the Company, the
Parent may provide such information to potential sources of capital and to
rating agencies and prospective lenders and investors during syndication of
the Financing (including any permitted alternative financing) subject to
customary confidentiality arrangements with such Persons regarding such
information.

 



 

6.13 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys rights
or obligations under this Agreement, (a) nothing contained in this Agreement
is intended to give the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its and its Subsidiaries operations.

 



 

6.14 _Security Holder Litigation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, the Company shall have the right to control the defense and settlement
of any litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement brought by any stockholder of the
Company or any holder of the Companys other securities against the Company
and/or its directors or officers, provided that the Company shall (a) keep the
Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status of such litigation, (b)
give the Parent the opportunity to participate, at the Parents expense, in
the defense or settlement of any such litigation, (c) give due consideration
to the Parents advice with respect to such litigation, and (d) not
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any litigation arising or resulting
from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or consent to the same
without the prior written consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parents
consent shall not be required if the settlement involves (i) solely the
payment of an aggregate amount not to exceed $500,000 (net of insurance and
including any attorneys fees in connection with such settlement) and
supplemental disclosure (provided that the Parent shall be given reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on any supplemental disclosure and the
Company shall consider in good faith any reasonable changes thereto proposed
by Parent), (ii) no admission of wrongdoing or liability, (iii) no injunctive
or similar relief, and (iv) the

 



      
 

 



 

withdrawal or dismissal of all claims and actions then pending relating to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby. For
the avoidance of doubt, following the Effective Time the defense of any such
litigation brought by stockholders of the Company against the directors of the
Company shall be controlled by such directors.

 



 

6.15 _Company Stockholder Consent; Preparation of Proxy Statement and
Information Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
but in no event later than December 22, 2017 (subject to the Parents
reasonable cooperation), the Company shall prepare (with the Parents
reasonable cooperation) and file with the SEC the Information Statement. If
the Written Consent is not delivered to the Parent by the Company in
accordance with Section 6.15(b), then as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter the Company shall (i) prepare (with the Parents reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC a proxy statement (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") to be sent to the
stockholders of the Company relating to a special meeting of the Companys
stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") to be held only if the
Written Consent is not delivered, to consider, among other matters, the
adoption of this Agreement, and (ii) set a record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and commence a broker search pursuant to Section 14a-13 of the
Exchange Act in connection therewith. The Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to have the Information Statement and, if applicable, the Proxy
Statement, cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after each such
filing (including by responding to comments of the SEC on a timely and
expeditious basis). Each of the Parent and the Company shall furnish all
information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any
such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Information
Statement or the Proxy Statement, as applicable. The Company will advise the
Parent promptly after it receives any oral or written request by the SEC for
amendment of the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement, as applicable,
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information, and will promptly provide the Parent with copies of
any written communication from the SEC or any state securities commission and
a reasonable opportunity to participate in the responses thereto. Following
the Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, having been
cleared by the SEC (or after ten (10) calendar days have passed since the
filing of the preliminary Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as
applicable, with the SEC without notice from the SEC of its intent to review
the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement), the Company shall cause the
Information Statement promptly following the Written Consent being signed and
delivered, or, in the case of the Proxy Statement, promptly following the
calling of the Company Stockholders Meeting, as applicable, to be mailed to
its stockholders and to be filed as required. If, at any time prior to the
date that is twenty (20) calendar days after the Information Statement is
first mailed to the Companys stockholders (or, in the case of the Proxy
Statement, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting), any
information relating to the Company or the Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by the Company or the
Parent that is required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, so that the
Information Statement or Proxy Statement, as applicable, shall not contain (in
the case of the Information Statement, at any time prior to the date that is
twenty (20) calendar days after the Information Statement is first mailed; or,
in the case of the Proxy Statement, before the

 



       
 

 



 

stockholders of the Company have voted) any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing
such information shall promptly be filed with the SEC and, to the extent
required under Applicable Law, disseminated to stockholders of the Company;
_provided_ that the delivery of such notice and the filing of any such
amendment or supplement shall not affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by any party hereunder or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to any party. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement,
as applicable, (or any amendment or supplement thereto, as applicable) or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (A)
shall provide the Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
such document or response and (B) shall give due consideration to the Parents
comments reasonably proposed by the Parent.

 



 

(b) Immediately prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to deliver to the Parent the Written Consent duly
executed by the Principal Stockholder and certified as true and complete by an
executive officer of the Company, which by its terms shall be effective
immediately following and conditional upon the receipt of the Parent
Stockholder Approval and satisfaction of the other conditions set forth in the
Company Voting Agreement; provided, however, that in no event shall the
Company be required to deliver the Written Consent prior to February 1, 2018.

 



 

(c) In the event that the Written Consent is not delivered in accordance with
Section 6.15(b), (i) unless the Company Board has made a Company Board
Recommendation Change, the Company, through the Company Board, (A) shall
recommend to its stockholders that they adopt this Agreement and (B) shall
include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (ii) the Company shall
duly take all lawful action pursuant its certificate of incorporation, bylaws,
the rules of the New York Stock Exchange and the DGCL to call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting as promptly as practicable
following the date of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and, if applicable, the advisory
vote required by Rule 14a-21(c) under the Exchange Act in connection
therewith, (iii) subject to any Company Board Recommendation Change that the
Company Board is permitted to make, the Company shall take all lawful action
to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall be permitted to adjourn,
delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting in accordance with
Applicable Law (but not beyond the Outside Date) (A) if the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with legal counsel that the
failure to so adjourn, delay or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under Applicable Law or (B) to
the extent necessary to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure which the Company Board has
determined in good faith after consultation with legal counsel is required
under Applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be
disseminated and reviewed by the Companys stockholders prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting.

however, that the Parent Stockholder Meeting date may be extended, if and to
the extent, the Parent reasonably believes in good faith, based on the advice
of outside legal counsel and after consultation with the Company, that it is
required to supplement the Parent Shareholders Circular and provide additional
time for shareholders of the Parent to consider the information in the
supplement, provided that the duration of any such extension shall be the
minimum number of Business Days which the Parent Board reasonably believes in
good faith, based on advice of outside legal counsel, is required by
Applicable Law to enable the Parent to prepare and circulate the supplementary
prospectus or circular and for the shareholders of the Parent to consider such
supplementary prospectus or circular. If, at any time prior to the
Readmission, any information relating to the Company, the Parent, US Holdco,
the Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers
should be discovered by the Company, the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub,
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Parent
Shareholders Circular so that the Parent Shareholders Circular shall not

notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall, to the extent required by Applicable Law,
be submitted to the UKLA for its approval and following such approval be
disseminated to the shareholders of the Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
prior to such submission and dissemination, the Parent shall provide copies of
such amendment or supplement to the Company not less than five (5) Business
Days (or such shorter period of time as is reasonably necessary in light of
the circumstances) in advance of any such submission or dissemination and
shall provide the Company an opportunity to review and comment on such
amendment or supplement to the full extent practicable and shall include in
such amendment or supplement all comments reasonably proposed by the Company
and reasonably acceptable to the Parent.

 



 

(b) The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment upon the Parent Shareholders Circular and any amendment or
supplement thereto before such document is published. In addition, the Parent,
US Holdco and the Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with
copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments,
the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from time
to time from the UKLA or their staff with respect to the Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholders Circular (or any amendment or supplement thereto) promptly after
receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses thereto. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment upon any such written responses and the Parent, US Holdco or the
Merger Sub shall give due consideration to any additions, deletions or changes
reasonably suggested thereto by the Company and its counsel. In the event that
the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub receives any comments from the UKLA or
their staff with respect to the Parent Shareholders Circular (or any amendment
or supplement thereto), the Parent, US Holdco, the Merger Sub and the Company
and their respective counsels shall each use all reasonable efforts to respond
promptly to such comments and to use all reasonable efforts to take such other
actions as may be reasonably necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

appointed in respect of the Parent Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment
thereof), (ii) promptly of the result of the vote on the resolutions proposed
at the Parent Stockholders Meeting (or adjournment thereof), (iii) promptly in
the event of any adjournment of any such meeting and (iv) promptly of any

Parent Stockholders Meeting except (A) with the consent of the Company; or (B)
to the extent required by Applicable Law or as contemplated by Section
6.16(a); and (ii) in the event of an adjournment of the Parent Stockholders
Meeting (other than where such adjournment relates to a Parent Board
Recommendation Change), to reconvene the Parent Stockholders Meeting as soon
as practicable.

 



 

6.17 _Rights Admission_ (a). The Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to ensure that the Rights Admission occurs as soon as reasonably practicable
after the date on which the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, including

8.3(b)(i), Section 8.3(b)(ii), Section 8.3(b)(iii) or Section 8.3(b)(iv) shall
be paid to the Parent by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2)

one occasion, whether or not the Base Company Termination Fee or the
Additional Company Termination Fee, as applicable, may be payable under more
than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times and
upon the occurrence of different events. For the avoidance of doubt, if the
Base Company Termination Fee is paid pursuant to Section 8.3(b), such fee
shall not be paid again pursuant to Section 8.3(c). In no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Base Company Termination Fee or the Additional
Company Termination Fee pursuant to this Section 8.3(d) if, at the time of
termination of this Agreement, the Parent is required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.3(e)(iii).

event that this Agreement is terminated:

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(g) or 8.1(k);

 



 

(iii) by either the Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(b) if all
the conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3(a), (b), (c) and (d) have
been satisfied at the time the Closing was required to occur (assuming for
this purpose that Section 7.3(e) was satisfied);

 



 

(iv) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(j) (or pursuant to Section 8.1(b)
under circumstances in which the Company would have been entitled to terminate
the Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(j)); or

 



 

(v) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(l) or 8.1(m),

 



 

provided, however, that the Parent shall not be required to pay the Parent
Termination Fee if, at the time of termination of this Agreement, the Company
is in material breach of this Agreement. Any fee due under Section 8.3(e),
shall be paid to the Company by wire transfer of same-day funds within two (2)
Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, that the parties hereto would not enter into this Agreement absent
such agreement and that each of the Base Company Termination Fee, the
Additional Company Termination Fee and the Parent Termination Fee is not a
penalty. Accordingly, if the Company or the Parent, as the case may be, fails
to timely pay any amount due pursuant to this Section 8.3, and, in order to
obtain the payment, the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, commences a
suit, action or

 



       
 

 



 

proceeding which results in a judgment against the other party, with respect
to the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger Sub, or parties, with respect to the
Company, for the payment set forth in this Section 8.3, such paying party
shall pay the other party or parties, as applicable, its or their reasonable
and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable and documented
attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, action or proceeding, together
with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date such payment was actually received.

 



 

(g) Except in the case of fraud, the Parent, US Holdco and the Merger Sub
agree that, upon any termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of
the Additional Company Termination Fee and/or the Base Company Termination Fee
by the Company, when due, pursuant to this Section 8.3, the Parent, US Holdco
and the Merger Sub shall be precluded from any other remedy against the
Company, at law or in equity or otherwise, and none of the Parent, US Holdco
and Merger Sub shall seek to obtain any recovery, judgment or damages of any
kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the
Company or any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
Affiliates and their respective Representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided that, in the case
of Willful Breach, the Parent may elect in its sole discretion to reject
payment of the Additional Company Termination Fee and/or the Base Company
Termination Fee and seek any alternative remedy available at law or in equity
or otherwise. Except in the case of fraud, the Company agrees that, upon any
termination of this Agreement and the payment in full of the Parent
Termination Fee by the Parent, when due, pursuant to this Section 8.3, the
Company shall be precluded from any other remedy against the Parent, US Holdco
or the Merger Sub, at law or in equity or otherwise, and the Company shall not
seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages of any kind, including
consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against the Parent, US Holdco,
the Merger Sub or any of their Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, stockholders or
Affiliates (other than GCH and Sirius Trust/Pax Settlement pursuant to the
Parent Irrevocable Undertakings) or their respective Representatives in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby;
provided that, in the case of Willful Breach, the Company may elect in its
sole discretion to reject payment of the Parent Termination Fee (and any fee
payable by GCH under the Parent Irrevocable Undertakings) and seek any
alternative remedy available at law or in equity or otherwise.

 



 

8.4 _Certain VAT Matters_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereto intend, and shall take the position and use all
reasonable endeavors to ensure that it is accepted for VAT purposes that the
Parent Termination Fee, the Base Company Termination Fee and the Additional
Company Termination Fee, being compensatory in nature, are outside the scope
of VAT and are not and will not be treated for VAT purposes, in whole or in
part, as consideration for a taxable supply.

 



 

(b) Accordingly, the Parent shall treat the payment of the Parent Termination
Fee, and the Company shall treat the payment of the Base Company Termination
Fee and the Additional Company Termination Fee, as falling outside the scope
of VAT and shall

 



      
 

 



 

pay the full amount of it free and clear of any deduction or adjustment
whether pursuant to Section 8.4(c)(ii)(2) or otherwise.

 



 

(c) If, however, the Parent Termination Fee is treated by any Taxing Authority
in whole or in part as the consideration for a taxable supply for VAT
purposes:

 



 

(i) if the Parent Termination Fee is treated by the relevant Taxing Authority
as the consideration for a taxable supply in respect of which the Company is
liable to account for VAT, then:

 



 

(1) The Company shall issue a valid VAT invoice to the Parent, and the Parent
shall use reasonable efforts to recover (by refund, credit, deduction or
otherwise) such VAT;

 



 

(2) if and to the extent that such VAT is not recoverable by the Parent by
refund, credit, deduction or otherwise, provided the Parent has used its
reasonable efforts to recover such VAT in accordance with Section
8.4(c)(i)(1), no additional amount shall be paid in respect of VAT and the
Parent Termination Fee shall be VAT inclusive; and/or

 



 

(3) if and to the extent that such VAT is recoverable by the Parent by refund,
credit, deduction or otherwise, or would be recoverable by the Parent had the
Parent used reasonable efforts to recover such VAT in accordance with Section
8.4(c)(i)(1), the amount of the Parent Termination Fee shall be increased to
take account of such recoverable VAT; and

 



 

(ii) if under a reverse charge mechanism the Parent Termination Fee is treated
by the relevant Taxing Authority as consideration for a taxable supply in
respect of which the Parent is liable to account for VAT, then;

 



 

(1) the Parent shall, (A) account for, under the reverse charge procedure, and
pay to the relevant Taxing Authority any VAT chargeable thereon, and (B) use
reasonable efforts to recover (by refund, credit, deduction or otherwise) any
such VAT; and

 



 

(2) the amount of the Parent Termination Fee payable by the Parent shall be
reduced by an amount such that the sum payable by the Parent, when aggregated
with any irrecoverable VAT thereon, is equal to the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee that would be payable but for this Section 8.4(c)(ii)(2),

 



 

such that after making any such adjustments the aggregate of (I) the total
amount of the Parent Termination Fee paid to the Company (including any amount
in respect of VAT) plus (II) any irrecoverable VAT incurred under a reverse
charge mechanism, together with any related interest or penalties in respect
of such reverse charge VAT (but excluding any interest or penalties arising as
a result of the unreasonable delay or default of the Parent, or relating to
any period after the Company has accounted to the Parent for any reduction in
the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.4(c)(ii)(2)), less (III) any
VAT which is recovered

 



      
 

 



 

or recoverable as referred to in Section 8.4(c)(i)(3), shall be equal to the
amount that the Parent Termination Fee would have been in the absence of such
VAT.

 



 

(d) Any adjustment payment in respect of any reduction made pursuant to
Section 8.4(c)(ii)(2) shall be made on or before the date which is five (5)
Business Days prior to the date on which the Parent is required to account to
any Taxing Authority for any such irrecoverable VAT.

 



 

(e) Any adjustment payment in respect of any adjustment made pursuant to
Section 8.4(c)(i)(3) shall be made on the date which is five (5) Business Days
following the date on which the Parent recovers, or would have recovered (by
refund, credit, deduction or otherwise) had it used reasonable efforts to do
so in accordance with Section 8.4(c)(i)(1), any amounts in respect of such
VAT.

 



 

(f) If, however, the Base Company Termination Fee or the Additional Company
Termination Fee is treated by any Taxing Authority in whole or in part as the
consideration for a taxable supply for VAT purposes, the provisions of Section
8.4(c), (d) and (e) shall apply as if (w) the first reference to the "Parent
Termination Fee" in Section 8.4(c) were to the "Base Company Termination Fee
or the Additional Company Termination Fee"; (x) all other references to the
"Parent Termination Fee" were to the "Base Company Termination Fee or the
Additional Company Termination Fee (as applicable)"; (y) references to "the
Company" were to "the Parent"; and (z) references to "the Parent" were to "the
Company".

 



 

(g) In this Section 8.4, references to the Parent and the Company include,
where applicable, references to a member of any group of which such entity is
a member for VAT purposes.

 



 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, all payments of the Parent Termination Fee,
the Base Company Termination Fee and the Additional Company Termination Fee
shall be inclusive of any applicable VAT save as otherwise provided in this
Section 8.4.

 



 

(i) In no event or circumstance shall the Parent be required to make a payment
pursuant to this Article 8 which is more than the maximum amount permitted to
be paid without the prior approval of its shareholders pursuant to the Listing
Rules.

 



 

8.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented by
the parties hereto by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors at any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after
receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Parent Stockholder
Approval; provided, however, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval or the Parent Stockholder Approval, no amendment may be made that
pursuant to Applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the
stockholders of the Company or the Parent, respectively, without such further
approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment,
modification or supplement hereto (as applicable), signed on behalf of each of
the parties hereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
(i) this Section 8.5 and Sections 10.4, 10.5, 10.9, 10.11(b) and 10.12 may not
be amended,

 



      
 

 



 

supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in any manner that is materially
adverse in any respect to Barclays Bank PLC or HSBC Bank plc without the prior
written consent of Barclays Bank PLC or HSBC Bank plc, respectively and (ii)
Section 10.15 may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified
in any manner that is materially adverse in any respect to the Financing
Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 



 

8.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors,
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive
any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of
the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a
party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth
in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or
waiver shall not apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. The failure of any party hereto to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



 

8.7 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1, an amendment, modification or
supplement of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.5 or an extension or waiver
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.6 shall, in order to be effective,
require action by the respective Board of Directors of the applicable parties.

Any party hereto may give any notice or other communication hereunder using
any other means (including personal delivery, messenger service, or ordinary
mail), but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been
duly given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it
is intended. Any party hereto may change the address to which notices and

hereto notice in the manner herein set forth. For avoidance of doubt, for
purposes of Sections 5.1 and 5.2 hereof, electronic mail delivered in
accordance with this Section 10.2 shall be deemed adequate written notice.

 



 

10.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein) constitutes the
entire agreement among the parties hereto and supersedes any prior
understandings, agreements or representations by or among the parties hereto,
or any of them, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof,
and the parties hereto specifically disclaim reliance on any such prior
understandings, agreements or representations to the extent not embodied in
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

10.4 _Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except (a)
as set forth in or contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section 6.6
(with respect to which the Indemnified Parties shall be third party

part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other

 



       
 

 



 

parties, and any such assignment without such prior written consent shall be
null and void; provided, that without such consent, the Parent, US Holdco and
the Merger Sub may assign their rights under this Agreement (i) to a wholly
owned Subsidiary, or (ii) from and after the Closing, to the Debt Financing
Sources in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby for collateral
security purposes, but in each case, such transfer or assignment shall not
affect the liabilities or obligations of the Parent, US Holdco or the Merger
Sub hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

10.6 _Severability_. Any term or provision (or part thereof) of this Agreement
that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall
not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and
provisions (or parts thereof) hereof or the validity or enforceability of the
offending term or provision (or part thereof) in any other situation or in any
other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction
declares that any term or provision (or part thereof) hereof is invalid or
unenforceable, the court making such determination shall have the power to
limit the term or provision (or part thereof), to delete specific words or
phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part
thereof) with a term or provision (or part thereof) that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid
or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof), and this Agreement shall
be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the
power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto shall replace
such invalid or unenforceable term or provision (or part thereof) with a valid
and enforceable term or provision (or part thereof) that will achieve, to the
extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or
unenforceable term (or part thereof).

 



 

10.7 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts (including by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic mail), each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic mail.

Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)
"include", "includes" and "including" are not limiting; (b) "hereof",

particular provision of this Agreement; (c) "date hereof" refers to the date
set forth in the initial caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase
"to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends,
and such phrase does not mean simply "if"; (e) descriptive headings, the table

10.10 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a Person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such Person, and
the exercise by a Person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary relief
(including any fees payable pursuant to Section 8.3), even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any action
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge and agree that (i) prior to the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to Article VIII, the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, without proof of actual damages
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement, at law or in equity,
(ii) the provisions set forth in Section 8.3 are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in any
respect any partys right to specific enforcement, and (iii) the right of
specific enforcement of this Agreement is an integral part of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and without that right, neither the Company
nor the Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

is vested in the courts of the United States of America, a federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b)

and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from

this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security that might be
required of any other Person with respect thereto. Each of the parties hereto
agrees that to the extent such party is not otherwise subject to service of
process in the State of Delaware, to appoint and maintain an agent in the
State of Delaware as such partys agent for service of process. Any party
hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in Section 10.2. Nothing in this Section
10.11(a), however, shall affect the right of any Person to serve legal process
in any other manner permitted by law.

support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract

or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, officer,
employee, partner (limited or general) or agent of another corporation or of a
partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan, shall
be (and shall be deemed to have a contractual right to be) indemnified and
held harmless by the Corporation (and any successor to the Corporation by
merger or otherwise) to the fullest extent authorized by, and subject to the
conditions and (except as provided herein) procedures set forth in the GCL, as
the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but any such amendment shall not
be deemed to limit or prohibit the rights of indemnification hereunder for
past acts or omissions of any such person insofar as such amendment limits or
prohibits the indemnification rights that said law permitted the Corporation
to provide prior to such amendment), against all expenses, liabilities and
losses (including attorneys fees, judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties
and amounts paid or to be paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered
by such person in connection therewith; provided, however, that the
Corporation shall indemnify any such person seeking indemnification in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person
(except for a suit or action pursuant to Paragraph 8 of Article FIFTH) only if
such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of
the Corporation. Persons who are not directors or officers of the Corporation
and are not so serving at the request of the Corporation may be similarly
indemnified in respect of such service to the extent authorized at any time by
the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The indemnification conferred in
this Paragraph 7 of Article FIFTH also shall include the right to be paid by
the Corporation (and such successor) the expenses (including attorneys fees)
incurred in the defense of or other involvement in any such proceeding in
advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if and to the
extent the GCL requires, the payment of such expenses (including attorneys
fees) incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of
a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of an
undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to repay all amounts
so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be determined that such director or
officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Paragraph 7 of Article
FIFTH or otherwise; and provided further, that, such expenses incurred by
other employees and agents may be so paid in advance upon such terms and
conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

 



 

(8) If a claim under Paragraph 7 of Article FIFTH is not paid in full by the
Corporation within sixty days after a written claim has been received by the
Corporation, the claimant

 



      
 

 



 

may at any time thereafter bring an action against the Corporation to recover
the unpaid amount of the claim and, if successful in whole or in part, the
claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of prosecuting such
action. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought
to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in connection with any proceeding in
advance of its final disposition where the required undertaking, if any is
required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met
the standards of conduct that make it permissible under the GCL for the
Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed or is otherwise
not entitled to indemnification under Paragraph 7 of Article FIFTH, but the
burden of proving such defense shall be on the Corporation. The failure of the
Corporation (in the manner provided under the GCL) to have made a
determination prior to or after the commencement of such action that
indemnification of the claimant is proper in the circumstances because he or
she has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the GCL shall not
be a defense to the action or create a presumption that the claimant has not
met the applicable standard of conduct. Unless otherwise specified in an
agreement with the claimant, an actual determination by the Corporation (in
the manner provided under the GCL) after the commencement of such action that
the claimant has not met such applicable standard of conduct shall not be a
defense to the action, but shall create a presumption that the claimant has
not met the applicable standard of conduct.

 



 

(9) In addition to the powers and authority hereinbefore or by statute
expressly conferred upon them, the directors are hereby empowered to exercise
all such powers and do all such acts and things as may be exercised or done by
the Corporation, subject, nevertheless, to the provisions of the GCL, this
Certificate of Incorporation, and any By-Laws adopted by the stockholders;
provided, however, that no By-Laws hereafter adopted by the stockholders shall
invalidate any prior act of the directors which would have been valid if such
By-Laws had not been adopted.

 



 

 _SIXTH:_ Meetings of stockholders may be held within or without the State of
Delaware, as the By-Laws may provide. The books of the Corporation may be kept
(subject to any provision contained in the GCL) outside the State of Delaware
at such place or places as may be designated from time to time by the Board of
Directors or in the By-Laws of the Corporation.

 



 

 _SEVENTH:_ The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or
repeal any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the
manner now or hereafter prescribed by statute, and all rights conferred upon
stockholders herein are granted subject to this reservation.

 _MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS_

 



 

Section 1. _Place of Meetings_. Meetings of the stockholders for the election
of directors or for any other purpose shall be held at such time and place,
either within or without the State of Delaware, as shall be designated from
time to time by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may, in its
sole discretion, determine that a meeting of the stockholders shall not be
held at any place, but may instead be held solely by means of remote
communication in the manner authorized by the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware (the "DGCL").

 



 

Section 2. _Annual Meetings_. The Annual Meeting of Stockholders for the
election of directors shall be held on such date and at such time as shall be
designated from time to time by the Board of Directors. Any other proper
business may be transacted at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders.

 



 

Section 3. _Special Meetings_. Unless otherwise required by law or by the
certificate of incorporation of the Corporation, as amended and restated from
time to time (the "Certificate of Incorporation"), Special Meetings of
Stockholders, for any purpose or purposes, may be called by either (i) the
Chairman, if there be one, or (ii) the President, (iii) any Vice President, if
there be one, (iv) the Secretary or (v) any Assistant Secretary, if there be
one, and shall be called by any such officer at the request in writing of (i)
the Board of Directors, (ii) a committee of the Board of Directors that has
been duly designated by the Board of Directors and whose powers and authority
include the power to call such meetings or (iii) stockholders owning a
majority of the capital stock of the Corporation issued and outstanding and
entitled to vote. Such request shall state the purpose or purposes of the
proposed meeting. At a Special Meeting of Stockholders, only such business
shall be conducted as shall be specified in the notice of meeting (or any
supplement thereto).

       
 

 



 

Section 4. _Notice_. Whenever stockholders are required or permitted to take
any action at a meeting, a written notice of the meeting shall be given which
shall state the place, if any, date and hour of the meeting, the means of
remote communications, if any, by which stockholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, and, in the case of a
Special Meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.
Unless otherwise required by law, written notice of any meeting shall be given
not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days before the date of the
meeting to each stockholder entitled to notice of and to vote at such meeting.

 



 

Section 5. _Adjournments_. Any meeting of the stockholders may be adjourned
from time to time to reconvene at the same or some other place, and notice
need not be given of any such adjourned meeting if the time and place, if any,
thereof and the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxyholders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken. At the adjourned meeting, the Corporation may transact any business
which might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment
is for more than thirty (30) days, or if after the adjournment a new record
date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting in
accordance with the requirements of Section 4 hereof shall be given to each
stockholder of record entitled to notice of and to vote at the meeting.

 



 

Section 6. _Quorum_. Unless otherwise required by applicable law or the
Certificate of Incorporation, the holders of a majority of the Corporations
capital stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders for the transaction of business. A quorum, once established,
shall not be broken by the withdrawal of enough votes to leave less than a
quorum. If, however, such quorum shall not be present or represented at any
meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders entitled to vote thereat,
present in person or represented by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the
meeting from time to time, in the manner provided in Section 5 hereof, until a
quorum shall be present or represented.

 



 

Section 7. _Voting_. Unless otherwise required by law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, or permitted by the rules of any stock
exchange on which the Corporations shares are listed and traded, any question
brought before any meeting of the stockholders, other than the election of
directors, shall be decided by the vote of the holders of a majority of the
total number of votes of the Corporations capital stock represented at the
meeting and entitled to vote on such question, voting as a single class.
Unless otherwise provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, and subject to
Section 11(a) of this Article II, each stockholder represented at a meeting of
the stockholders shall be entitled to cast one (1) vote for each share of the
capital stock entitled to vote thereat held by such stockholder. Such votes
may be cast in person or by proxy as provided in Section 8 of this Article II.
The Board of Directors, in its discretion, or the officer of the Corporation
presiding at a meeting of the stockholders, in such officers discretion, may
require that any votes cast at such meeting shall be cast by written ballot.

 



 

Section 8. _Proxies_. Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing
without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy, but no such proxy shall be voted upon after three years
from its date, unless such proxy provides for a longer period. Without
limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another person or

      
 

 



 

persons to act for such stockholder as proxy, the following shall constitute a
valid means by which a stockholder may grant such authority:

 



 

(i) A stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another person or persons
to act for such stockholder as proxy. Execution may be accomplished by the
stockholder or such stockholders authorized officer, director, employee or
agent signing such writing or causing such persons signature to be affixed to
such writing by any reasonable means, including, but not limited to, by
facsimile signature.

 



 

(ii) A stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for such
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing the transmission of a
telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission to the person
who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy solicitation firm, proxy
support service organization or like agent duly authorized by the person who
will be the holder of the proxy to receive such transmission, provided that
any such telegram, cablegram or other means of electronic transmission must
either set forth or be submitted with information from which it can be
determined that the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was
authorized by the stockholder. If it is determined that such telegrams,
cablegrams or other electronic transmissions are valid, the inspectors or, if
there are no inspectors, such other persons making that determination shall
specify the information on which they relied.

 



 

Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission authorizing another person or persons to act as proxy
for a stockholder may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used; provided, however, that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

 



 

Section 9. _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation, any action required or permitted
to be taken at any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders of the
Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken,
shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the
minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present
and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its
registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business,
or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which
proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the
Corporations registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered
mail, return receipt requested. Every written consent shall bear the date of
signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent
shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless,
within sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered in the manner
required by this Section 9 to the Corporation, written consents signed by a
sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the Corporation
by delivery to its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal
place of business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of
the book in which proceedings of meetings of the stockholders are recorded. A
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission consenting to an action
to be taken and

      
 

 



 

transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons
authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be
written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section 9, provided that
any such telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission sets forth or is
delivered with information from which the Corporation can determine (i) that
the telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission was transmitted by
the stockholder or proxyholder or by a person or persons authorized to act for
the stockholder or proxyholder and (ii) the date on which such stockholder or
proxyholder or authorized person or persons transmitted such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission. The date on which such telegram,
cablegram or electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the
date on which such consent was signed. No consent given by telegram, cablegram
or other electronic transmission shall be deemed to have been delivered until
such consent is reproduced in paper form and until such paper form shall be
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of the
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations registered
office shall be made by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a
consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used,
provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing. Prompt notice of the taking of
the corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and
who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to
notice of the meeting if the record date for such meeting had been the date
that written consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take the
action were delivered to the Corporation as provided above in this Section 9.

 



 

Section 10. _List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote_. The officer of the
Corporation who has charge of the stock ledger of the Corporation shall
prepare and make, at least ten (10) days before every meeting of the
stockholders, a complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the
meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
stockholder and the number of shares registered in the name of each
stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of any stockholder,
for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours, for a
period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting (i) on a reasonably
accessible electronic network, provided that the information required to gain
access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during
ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Corporation. In the event that the Corporation determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps
to ensure that such information is available only to stockholders of the
Corporation. If the meeting is to be held at a place, then the list shall be
produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present. If the
meeting is to be held solely by means of remote communication, then the list
shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time
of the meeting on a reasonably accessible electronic network, and the
information required to access such list shall be provided with the notice of
the meeting.

 



 

Section 11. _Record Date_.

 



 

(a) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of the stockholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of

       
 

 



 

Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) nor less
than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is fixed
by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the stockholders shall be at
the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is
given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which the meeting is held. A determination of
stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of the
stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however,
that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned
meeting.

 



 

(b) In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board of
Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date
upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board of
Directors, and which record date shall not be more than ten (10) days after
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of
Directors, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board of Directors is required by applicable law, shall be the first date on
which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to
be taken is delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or
agent of the Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of
meetings of the stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporations
registered office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board of Directors
and prior action by the Board of Directors is required by applicable law, the
record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate
action in writing without a meeting shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution taking such prior
action.

 



 

Section 12. _Stock Ledger_. The stock ledger of the Corporation shall be the
only evidence as to who are the stockholders entitled to examine the stock
ledger, the list required by Section 10 of this Article II or the books of the
Corporation, or to vote in person or by proxy at any meeting of the
stockholders.

 



 

Section 13. _Conduct of Meetings_. The Board of Directors of the Corporation
may adopt by resolution such rules and regulations for the conduct of any
meeting of the stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent
inconsistent with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of
Directors, the chairman of any meeting of the stockholders shall have the
right and authority to prescribe such rules, regulations and procedures and to
do all such acts as, in the judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the
proper conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, whether
adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the chairman of the
meeting, may include, without limitation, the following: (i) the establishment
of an agenda or order of business for the meeting; (ii) the determination of
when the polls shall open and close for any given matter to be voted on at the
meeting; (iii) rules and procedures for maintaining order at the meeting and
the safety of those present; (iv) limitations on attendance at or
participation in the meeting to stockholders of record of the Corporation,
their duly authorized and constituted proxies or such other persons as the
chairman of the meeting shall determine; (v) restrictions on entry to the
meeting after the time

      
 

 



 

fixed for the commencement thereof; and (vi) limitations on the time allotted
to questions or comments by participants.

 



 

Section 14. _Inspectors of Election_. In advance of any meeting of the
stockholders, the Board of Directors, by resolution, the Chairman or the
President shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting and make
a written report thereof. One or more other persons may be designated as
alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to act. If no
inspector or alternate is able to act at a meeting of the stockholders, the
chairman of the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act at the
meeting. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, inspectors may be
officers, employees or agents of the Corporation. Each inspector, before
entering upon the discharge of the duties of inspector, shall take and sign an
oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality
and according to the best of such inspectors ability. The inspector shall
have the duties prescribed by law and shall take charge of the polls and, when
the vote is completed, shall make a certificate of the result of the vote
taken and of such other facts as may be required by applicable law.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _DIRECTORS_

 



 

Section 1. _Number and Election of Directors_. The Board of Directors shall
consist of not less than one nor more than fifteen members, the exact number
of which shall be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors. Except as
provided in Section 2 of this Article III, directors shall be elected by a
plurality of the votes cast at each Annual Meeting of Stockholders and each
director so elected shall hold office until the next Annual Meeting of
Stockholders and until such directors successor is duly elected and
qualified, or until such directors earlier death, resignation or removal.
Directors need not be stockholders.

 



 

Section 2. _Vacancies_. Unless otherwise required by law or the Certificate of
Incorporation, vacancies on the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
arising through death, resignation, removal, an increase in the number of
directors constituting the Board of Directors or such committee or otherwise
may be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, though less
than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. The directors so chosen shall,
in the case of the Board of Directors, hold office until the next annual
election and until their successors are duly elected and qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal and, in the case of any committee
of the Board of Directors, shall hold office until their successors are duly
appointed by the Board of Directors or until their earlier death, resignation
or removal.

 



 

Section 3. _Duties and Powers_. The business and affairs of the Corporation
shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors which may
exercise all such powers of the Corporation and do all such lawful acts and
things as are not by statute or by the Certificate of Incorporation or by
these By-Laws required to be exercised or done by the stockholders.

 



 

Section 4. _Meetings_. The Board of Directors and any committee thereof may
hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or without the State of
Delaware. Regular meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee thereof
may be held without notice at such time and at such place as may from time to
time be determined by the Board of Directors or such committee, respectively.
Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman, if
there be one, the President, or by any director. Special meetings of any
committee

      
 

 



 

of the Board of Directors may be called by the chairman of such committee, if
there be one, the President, or any director serving on such committee. Notice
thereof stating the place, date and hour of the meeting shall be given to each
director (or, in the case of a committee, to each member of such committee)
either by mail not less than forty-eight (48) hours before the date of the
meeting, by telephone, telegram or electronic means on twenty-four (24) hours
notice, or on such shorter notice as the person or persons calling such
meeting may deem necessary or appropriate in the circumstances.

 



 

Section 5. _Organization_. At each meeting of the Board of Directors or any
committee thereof, the Chairman of the Board of Directors or the chairman of
such committee, as the case may be, or, in his or her absence or if there be
none, a director chosen by a majority of the directors present, shall act as
chairman. Except as provided below, the Secretary of the Corporation shall act
as secretary at each meeting of the Board of Directors and of each committee
thereof. In case the Secretary shall be absent from any meeting of the Board
of Directors or of any committee thereof, an Assistant Secretary shall perform
the duties of secretary at such meeting; and in the absence from any such
meeting of the Secretary and all the Assistant Secretaries, the chairman of
the meeting may appoint any person to act as secretary of the meeting.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the members of each committee of the Board of
Directors may appoint any person to act as secretary of any meeting of such
committee and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of the Corporation may,
but need not if such committee so elects, serve in such capacity.

 



 

Section 6. _Resignations and Removals of Directors_. Any director of the
Corporation may resign from the Board of Directors or any committee thereof at
any time, by giving notice in writing or by electronic transmission to the
Chairman of the Board of Directors, if there be one, the President or the
Secretary of the Corporation and, in the case of a committee, to the chairman
of such committee, if there be one. Such resignation shall take effect at the
time therein specified or, if no time is specified, immediately; and, unless
otherwise specified in such notice, the acceptance of such resignation shall
not be necessary to make it effective. Except as otherwise required by
applicable law and subject to the rights, if any, of the holders of shares of
preferred stock then outstanding, any director or the entire Board of
Directors may be removed from office at any time, by the affirmative vote of
the holders of at least a majority in voting power of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Corporation entitled to vote in the election
of directors. Any director serving on a committee of the Board of Directors
may be removed from such committee at any time by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 7. _Quorum_. Except as otherwise required by law, or the Certificate
of Incorporation or the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or
quotation system on which the Corporations securities are listed or quoted
for trading, at all meetings of the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof, a majority of the entire Board of Directors or a majority of the
directors constituting such committee, as the case may be, shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the
directors or committee members present at any meeting at which there is a
quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such committee, as
applicable. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, the directors present thereat may adjourn
the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the
meeting of the time and place of the adjourned meeting, until a quorum shall
be present.

 



 

Section 8. _Actions of the Board by Written Consent_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action
required or permitted

      
 

 



 

to be taken at any meeting of the Board of Directors or of any committee
thereof may be taken without a meeting, if all the members of the Board of
Directors or such committee, as the case may be, consent thereto in writing or
by electronic transmission, and the writing or writings or electronic
transmission or transmissions are filed with the minutes of proceedings of the
Board of Directors or such committee. Such filing shall be in paper form if
the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if
the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

 



 

Section 9. _Meetings by Means of Conference Telephone_. Unless otherwise
provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, members of the
Board of Directors of the Corporation, or any committee thereof, may
participate in a meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee by means
of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which
all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and
participation in a meeting pursuant to this Section 9 shall constitute
presence in person at such meeting.

 



 

Section 10. _Committees_. The Board of Directors may designate one or more
committees, each committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the
Corporation. Each member of a committee must meet the requirements for
membership, if any, imposed by applicable law and the rules and regulations of
any securities exchange or quotation system on which the securities of the
Corporation are listed or quoted for trading. The Board of Directors may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may
replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting of any such
committee. Subject to the rules and regulations of any securities exchange or
quotation system on which the securities of the Corporation are listed or
quoted for trading, in the absence or disqualification of a member of a
committee, and in the absence of a designation by the Board of Directors of an
alternate member to replace the absent or disqualified member, the member or
members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting,
whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may unanimously
appoint another qualified member of the Board of Directors to act at the
meeting in the place of any absent or disqualified member. Any committee, to
the extent permitted by law and provided in the resolution establishing such
committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the
Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the
Corporation, and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to
all papers which may require it. Each committee shall keep regular minutes and
report to the Board of Directors when required. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Article III, the resolution of the Board of
Directors establishing any committee of the Board of Directors and/or the
charter of any such committee may establish requirements or procedures
relating to the governance and/or operation of such committee that are
different from, or in addition to, those set forth in these By-Laws and, to
the extent that there is any inconsistency between these By-Laws and any such
resolution or charter, the terms of such resolution or charter shall be
controlling.

 



 

Section 11. _Compensation_. The directors may be paid their expenses, if any,
of attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors and may be paid a
fixed sum for attendance at each meeting of the Board of Directors or a stated
salary for service as director, payable in cash or securities. No such payment
shall preclude any director from serving the Corporation in any other capacity
and receiving compensation therefor. Members of special or standing committees
may be allowed like compensation for service as committee members.

 



 

Section 12. _Interested Directors_. No contract or transaction between the
Corporation and one or more of its directors or officers, or between the
Corporation and any

      
 

 



 

other corporation, partnership, association or other organization in which one
or more of its directors or officers are directors or officers or have a
financial interest, shall be void or voidable solely for this reason, or
solely because the director or officer is present at or participates in the
meeting of the Board of Directors or committee thereof which authorizes the
contract or transaction, or solely because any such directors or officers
vote is counted for such purpose if: (i) the material facts as to the
directors or officers relationship or interest and as to the contract or
transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board of Directors or the
committee, and the Board of Directors or committee in good faith authorizes
the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the
disinterested directors, even though the disinterested directors be less than
a quorum; or (ii) the material facts as to the directors or officers
relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed
or are known to the stockholders entitled to vote thereon, and the contract or
transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of the
stockholders; or (iii) the contract or transaction is fair as to the
Corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved or ratified by the Board
of Directors, a committee thereof or the stockholders. Common or interested
directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting
of the Board of Directors or of a committee which authorizes the contract or
transaction.

Section 1. _General_. The officers of the Corporation shall be chosen by the
Board of Directors and shall be a President, a Secretary and a Treasurer. The
Board of Directors, in its discretion, also may choose a Chairman of the Board
of Directors (who must be a director) and one or more Vice Presidents,
Assistant Secretaries, Assistant Treasurers and other officers. Any number of
offices may be held by the same person, unless otherwise prohibited by law,
the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws. The officers of the
Corporation need not be stockholders of the Corporation nor, except in the
case of the Chairman of the Board of Directors, need such officers be
directors of the Corporation.

 



 

Section 2. _Election_. The Board of Directors, at its first meeting held after
each Annual Meeting of Stockholders (or action by written consent of
stockholders in lieu of the Annual Meeting of Stockholders), shall elect the
officers of the Corporation who shall hold their offices for such terms and
shall exercise such powers and perform such duties as shall be determined from
time to time by the Board of Directors; and each officer of the Corporation
shall hold office until such officers successor is elected and qualified, or
until such officers earlier death, resignation or removal. Any officer
elected by the Board of Directors may be removed at any time by the Board of
Directors. Any vacancy occurring in any office of the Corporation shall be
filled by the Board of Directors. The salaries of all officers of the
Corporation shall be fixed by the Board of Directors.

proxies, waivers of notice of meeting, consents and other instruments relating
to securities owned by the Corporation may be executed in the name of and on
behalf of the Corporation by the President or any Vice President or any other
officer authorized to do so by the Board of Directors and any such officer
may, in the name of and on behalf of the Corporation, take all such action as
any such officer may deem advisable to vote in person or by proxy at any
meeting of security holders of any corporation in which the Corporation may
own securities and at any

      
 

 



 

such meeting shall possess and may exercise any and all rights and power
incident to the ownership of such securities and which, as the owner thereof,
the Corporation might have exercised and possessed if present. The Board of
Directors may, by resolution, from time to time confer like powers upon any
other person or persons.

 



 

Section 4. _Chairman of the Board of Directors_. The Chairman of the Board of
Directors, if there be one, shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders
and of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of the Board of Directors shall be
the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation, unless the Board of Directors
designates the President as the Chief Executive Officer, and, except where by
law the signature of the President is required, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors shall possess the same power as the President to sign all contracts,
certificates and other instruments of the Corporation which may be authorized
by the Board of Directors. During the absence or disability of the President,
the Chairman of the Board of Directors shall exercise all the powers and
discharge all the duties of the President. The Chairman of the Board of
Directors shall also perform such other duties and may exercise such other
powers as may from time to time be assigned by these By-Laws or by the Board
of Directors.

 



 

Section 5. _President_. The President shall, subject to the control of the
Board of Directors and, if there be one, the Chairman of the Board of
Directors, have general supervision of the business of the Corporation and
shall see that all orders and resolutions of the Board of Directors are
carried into effect. The President shall execute all bonds, mortgages,
contracts and other instruments of the Corporation requiring a seal, under the
seal of the Corporation, except where required or permitted by law to be
otherwise signed and executed and except that the other officers of the
Corporation may sign and execute documents when so authorized by these By-
Laws, the Board of Directors or the President. In the absence or disability of
the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or if there be none, the President
shall preside at all meetings of the stockholders and, provided the President
is also a director, the Board of Directors. If there be no Chairman of the
Board of Directors, or if the Board of Directors shall otherwise designate,
the President shall be the Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation. The
President shall also perform such other duties and may exercise such other
powers as may from time to time be assigned to such officer by these By-Laws
or by the Board of Directors.

 



 

Section 6. _Vice Presidents_. At the request of the President or in the
Presidents absence or in the event of the Presidents inability or refusal to
act (and if there be no Chairman of the Board of Directors), the Vice
President, or the Vice Presidents if there are more than one (in the order
designated by the Board of Directors), shall perform the duties of the
President, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to
all the restrictions upon the President. Each Vice President shall perform
such other duties and have such other powers as the Board of Directors from
time to time may prescribe. If there be no Chairman of the Board of Directors
and no Vice President, the Board of Directors shall designate the officer of
the Corporation who, in the absence of the President or in the event of the
inability or refusal of the President to act, shall perform the duties of the
President, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and be subject to
all the restrictions upon the President.

 



 

Section 7. _Secretary_. The Secretary shall attend all meetings of the Board
of Directors and all meetings of the stockholders and record all the
proceedings thereat in a book or books to be kept for that purpose; the
Secretary shall also perform like duties for committees of the Board of
Directors when required. The Secretary shall give, or cause to be given,
notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special meetings of the Board
of Directors, and shall

      
 

 



 

perform such other duties as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors, the
Chairman of the Board of Directors or the President, under whose supervision
the Secretary shall be. If the Secretary shall be unable or shall refuse to
cause to be given notice of all meetings of the stockholders and special
meetings of the Board of Directors, and if there be no Assistant Secretary,
then either the Board of Directors or the President may choose another officer
to cause such notice to be given. The Secretary shall have custody of the seal
of the Corporation and the Secretary or any Assistant Secretary, if there be
one, shall have authority to affix the same to any instrument requiring it and
when so affixed, it may be attested by the signature of the Secretary or by
the signature of any such Assistant Secretary. The Board of Directors may give
general authority to any other officer to affix the seal of the Corporation
and to attest to the affixing by such officers signature. The Secretary shall
see that all books, reports, statements, certificates and other documents and
records required by law to be kept or filed are properly kept or filed, as the
case may be.

 



 

Section 8. _Treasurer_. The Treasurer shall have the custody of the corporate
funds and securities and shall keep full and accurate accounts of receipts and
disbursements in books belonging to the Corporation and shall deposit all
moneys and other valuable effects in the name and to the credit of the
Corporation in such depositories as may be designated by the Board of
Directors. The Treasurer shall disburse the funds of the Corporation as may be
ordered by the Board of Directors, taking proper vouchers for such
disbursements, and shall render to the President and the Board of Directors,
at its regular meetings, or when the Board of Directors so requires, an
account of all transactions as Treasurer and of the financial condition of the
Corporation. If required by the Board of Directors, the Treasurer shall give
the Corporation a bond in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall
be satisfactory to the Board of Directors for the faithful performance of the
duties of the office of the Treasurer and for the restoration to the
Corporation, in case of the Treasurers death, resignation, retirement or
removal from office, of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property
of whatever kind in the Treasurers possession or under the Treasurers
control belonging to the Corporation.

 



 

Section 9. _Assistant Secretaries_. Assistant Secretaries, if there be any,
shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may be
assigned to them by the Board of Directors, the President, any Vice President,
if there be one, or the Secretary, and in the absence of the Secretary or in
the event of the Secretarys inability or refusal to act, shall perform the
duties of the Secretary, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and
be subject to all the restrictions upon the Secretary.

 



 

Section 10. _Assistant Treasurers_. Assistant Treasurers, if there be any,
shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time may be
assigned to them by the Board of Directors, the President, any Vice President,
if there be one, or the Treasurer, and in the absence of the Treasurer or in
the event of the Treasurers inability or refusal to act, shall perform the
duties of the Treasurer, and when so acting, shall have all the powers of and
be subject to all the restrictions upon the Treasurer. If required by the
Board of Directors, an Assistant Treasurer shall give the Corporation a bond
in such sum and with such surety or sureties as shall be satisfactory to the
Board of Directors for the faithful performance of the duties of the office of
Assistant Treasurer and for the restoration to the Corporation, in case of the
Assistant Treasurers death, resignation, retirement or removal from office,
of all books, papers, vouchers, money and other property of whatever kind in
the Assistant Treasurers possession or under the Assistant Treasurers
control belonging to the Corporation.

      
 

 



 

Section 11. _Other Officers_. Such other officers as the Board of Directors
may choose shall perform such duties and have such powers as from time to time
may be assigned to them by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may
delegate to any other officer of the Corporation the power to choose such
other officers and to prescribe their respective duties and powers.

 _STOCK_

 



 

Section 1. _Form of Certificates_. Every holder of stock in the Corporation
shall be entitled to have a certificate signed by, or in the name of the
Corporation (i) by the Chairman of the Board of Directors, or the President or
a Vice President and (ii) by the Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer, or the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Corporation, certifying the number
of shares owned by such stockholder in the Corporation.

 



 

Section 2. _Signatures_. Any or all of the signatures on a certificate may be
a facsimile. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed
or whose facsimile signature has been placed upon a certificate shall have
ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate
is issued, it may be issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such
person were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.

 



 

Section 3. _Lost Certificates_. The Board of Directors may direct a new
certificate to be issued in place of any certificate theretofore issued by the
Corporation alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming the certificate of stock to
be lost, stolen or destroyed. When authorizing such issue of a new
certificate, the Board of Directors may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, or such owners legal representative, to advertise the
same in such manner as the Board of Directors shall require and/or to give the
Corporation a bond in such sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against the Corporation on account of the alleged loss, theft
or destruction of such certificate or the issuance of such new certificate.

 



 

Section 4. _Transfers_. Stock of the Corporation shall be transferable in the
manner prescribed by applicable law and in these By-Laws. Transfers of stock
shall be made on the books of the Corporation only by the person named in the
certificate or by such persons attorney lawfully constituted in writing and
upon the surrender of the certificate therefor, properly endorsed for transfer
and payment of all necessary transfer taxes; provided, however, that such
surrender and endorsement or payment of taxes shall not be required in any
case in which the officers of the Corporation shall determine to waive such
requirement. Every certificate exchanged, returned or surrendered to the
Corporation shall be marked "Cancelled," with the date of cancellation, by the
Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Corporation or the transfer agent
thereof. No transfer of stock shall be valid as against the Corporation for
any purpose until it shall have been entered in the stock records of the
Corporation by an entry showing from and to whom transferred.

 



 

Section 5. _Dividend Record Date_. In order that the Corporation may determine
the stockholders entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other
distribution or allotment of any rights or the stockholders entitled to
exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock,
or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix
a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the

      
 

 



 

resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall be
not more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no record date is
fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts
the resolution relating thereto.

 



 

Section 6. _Record Owners_. The Corporation shall be entitled to recognize the
exclusive right of a person registered on its books as the owner of shares to
receive dividends, and to vote as such owner, and to hold liable for calls and
assessments a person registered on its books as the owner of shares, and shall
not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such
share or shares on the part of any other person, whether or not it shall have
express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise required by law.

 



 

Section 7. _Transfer and Registry Agents_. The Corporation may from time to
time maintain one or more transfer offices or agencies and registry offices or
agencies at such place or places as may be determined from time to time by the

ARTICLE VI

 



 

 _NOTICES_

 



 

Section 1. _Notices_. Whenever written notice is required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any director,
member of a committee or stockholder, such notice may be given by mail,
addressed to such director, member of a committee or stockholder, at such
persons address as it appears on the records of the Corporation, with postage
thereon prepaid, and such notice shall be deemed to be given at the time when
the same shall be deposited in the United States mail. Without limiting the
manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any
notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under applicable law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission if consented to by the stockholder to whom the
notice is given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by
written notice to the Corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed to be
revoked if (i) the Corporation is unable to deliver by electronic transmission
two (2) consecutive notices by the Corporation in accordance with such consent
and (ii) such inability becomes known to the Secretary or Assistant Secretary
of the Corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person responsible for
the giving of notice; provided, however, that the inadvertent failure to treat
such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other
action. Notice given by electronic transmission, as described above, shall be
deemed given: (i) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number
at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (ii) if by
electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address at which the
stockholder has consented to receive notice; (iii) if by a posting on an
electronic network, together with separate notice to the stockholder of such
specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of
such separate notice; and (iv) if by any other form of electronic
transmission, when directed to the stockholder. Notice to directors or
committee members may be given personally or by telegram, telex, cable or by
means of electronic transmission.

 



 

Section 2. _Waivers of Notice_. Whenever any notice is required by applicable
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to be given to any
director, member of a committee or stockholder, a waiver thereof in writing,
signed by the person or persons entitled to notice, or a waiver by electronic
transmission by the person or persons entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent thereto. Attendance
of a

      
 

 



 

person at a meeting, present in person or represented by proxy, shall
constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where the person attends
the meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the beginning of the
meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully
called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose
of, any Annual or Special Meeting of Stockholders or any regular or special
meeting of the directors or members of a committee of directors need be
specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws.

 



 

ARTICLE VII

 



 

 _GENERAL PROVISIONS_

 



 

Section 1. _Dividends_. Dividends upon the capital stock of the Corporation,
subject to the requirements of the DGCL and the provisions of the Certificate
of Incorporation, if any, may be declared by the Board of Directors at any
regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors (or any action by written
consent in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 8 of Article III hereof),
and may be paid in cash, in property, or in shares of the Corporations
capital stock. Before payment of any dividend, there may be set aside out of
any funds of the Corporation available for dividends such sum or sums as the
Board of Directors from time to time, in its absolute discretion, deems proper
as a reserve or reserves to meet contingencies, or for purchasing any of the
shares of capital stock, warrants, rights, options, bonds, debentures, notes,
scrip or other securities or evidences of indebtedness of the Corporation, or
for equalizing dividends, or for repairing or maintaining any property of the
Corporation, or for any proper purpose, and the Board of Directors may modify
or abolish any such reserve.

 



 

Section 2. _Disbursements_. All checks or demands for money and notes of the
Corporation shall be signed by such officer or officers or such other person
or persons as the Board of Directors may from time to time designate.

 



 

Section 3. _Fiscal Year_. The fiscal year of the Corporation shall be fixed by
resolution of the Board of Directors.

the name of the Corporation, the year of its organization and the words
"Corporate Seal, Delaware". The seal may be used by causing it or a facsimile
thereof to be impressed or affixed or reproduced or otherwise.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII

 



 

 _INDEMNIFICATION; INSURANCE_

 



 

Section 1. _Authorization of Indemnification_. Each person who was or is a
party or is threatened to be made a party to or is involved in any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative and whether by or in the right of the
Corporation or otherwise (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or
she, or a person of whom he or she is the legal representative, is or was a
director or officer of the Corporation or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner (limited or general)
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other enterprise, including service with respect
to an employee benefit plan, shall be (and shall be deemed to have a
contractual right to be)

      
 

 



 

indemnified and held harmless by the Corporation (and any successor to the
Corporation by merger or otherwise) to the fullest extent authorized by, and
subject to the conditions and (except as provided herein) procedures set forth
in the DGCL, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but any such
amendment shall not be deemed to limit or prohibit the rights of
indemnification hereunder for past acts or omissions of any such person
insofar as such amendment limits or prohibits the indemnification rights that
said law permitted the Corporation to provide prior to such amendment),
against all expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, ERISA taxes or penalties and amounts paid or to be paid in
settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by such person in connection
therewith; provided, however, that the Corporation shall indemnify any such
person seeking indemnification in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such person (except for a suit or action pursuant to
Section 2 of this Article VIII) only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was
authorized by the Board of Directors. Persons who are not directors or
officers of the Corporation and are not so serving at the request of the
Corporation may be similarly indemnified in respect of such service to the
extent authorized at any time by the Board of Directors. The indemnification
conferred in this Section 1 of this Article VIII also shall include the right
to be paid by the Corporation (and such successor) the expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred in the defense of or other involvement in any such
proceeding in advance of its final disposition; provided, however, that, if
and to the extent the DGCL requires, the payment of such expenses (including
attorneys fees) incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final
disposition of a proceeding shall be made only upon delivery to the
Corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of such director or officer to
repay all amounts so paid in advance if it shall ultimately be determined that
such director or officer is not entitled to be indemnified under this Section
1 of this Article VIII or otherwise; and provided further, that, such expenses
incurred by other employees and agents may be so paid in advance upon such
terms and conditions, if any, as the Board of Directors deems appropriate.

 



 

Section 2. _Right of Claimant to Bring Action Against the Corporation_. If a
claim under Section 1 of this Article VIII is not paid in full by the
Corporation within sixty (60) days after a written claim has been received by
the Corporation, the claimant may at any time thereafter bring an action
against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and, if
successful in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting such action. It shall be a defense to any such
action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred
in connection with any proceeding in advance of its final disposition where
the required undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the
Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct that make
it permissible under the DGCL for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant
for the amount claimed or is otherwise not entitled to indemnification under
Section 1 of this Article VIII, but the burden of proving such defense shall
be on the Corporation. The failure of the Corporation (in the manner provided
under the DGCL) to have made a determination prior to or after the
commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in
the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable standard of conduct
set forth in the DGCL shall not be a defense to the action or create a
presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of conduct.
Unless otherwise specified in an agreement with the claimant, an actual
determination by the Corporation (in the manner provided under the DGCL) after
the commencement of such action that the claimant has not met such applicable
standard of conduct shall not be a defense to the

      
 

 



 

action, but shall create a presumption that the claimant has not met the
applicable standard of conduct.

 



 

Section 3. _Non-exclusivity_. The rights to indemnification and advance
payment of expenses provided by Section 1 of this Article VIII shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification
and advance payment of expenses may be entitled under any By-Law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to
action in his or her official capacity and as to action in another capacity
while holding such office.

 



 

Section 4. _Survival of Indemnification_. The indemnification and advance
payment of expenses and rights thereto provided by, or granted pursuant to,
Section 1 of this Article VIII shall, unless otherwise provided when
authorized or ratified, continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, employee, partner or agent and shall inure to the benefit
of the personal representatives, heirs, executors and administrators of such
person.

 



 

Section 5. _Insurance_. The Corporation shall have power to purchase and
maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at the request of
the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, partner (limited or general)
or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited
liability company, trust or other enterprise, against any liability asserted
against such person or incurred by such person in any such capacity, or
arising out of such persons status as such, and related expenses, whether or
not the Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
liability under the provisions of the DGCL.

 



 

 _ARTICLE IX 
AMENDMENTS_

 



 

Section 1. _Amendments_. These By-Laws may be altered, amended or repealed, in
whole or in part, or new By-Laws may be adopted by the stockholders or by the
Board of Directors; provided, however, that notice of such alteration,
amendment, repeal or adoption of new By-Laws be contained in the notice of
such meeting of the stockholders or Board of Directors, as the case may be.
All such amendments must be approved by either the holders of a majority of
the outstanding capital stock entitled to vote thereon or by a majority of the
entire Board of Directors then in office.

 



 

Section 2. _Entire Board of Directors_. As used in this Article IX and in
these By-Laws generally, the term "entire Board of Directors" means the total
number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no
vacancies.
