as follows:

 

 

ARTICLE I

 

_MERGER_

 

 

1.1 _Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions
of the DGCL, Merger Sub and  the Company shall consummate the Merger,
pursuant to which Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company,
following which the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and
the Company shall continue as the surviving  corporation. The Company, as the
surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to
as the "Surviving Corporation" (provided, that references to the Company for 
periods after the Effective Time shall include the Surviving Corporation).

 

 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing the Certificate of Merger for the merger of Merger Sub
with and into the Company (the "Certificate of Merger") with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in such form as is required by, and executed in
accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and mutually  agreed by
the Parties (the time of such filing, or such later time as may be specified
in the Certificate of Merger, being the "Effective Time").

 

 

1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the
applicable provisions of the  DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities,
duties and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company  shall become the
property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts,
Liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving Corporation, which shall
include the assumption by the Surviving Corporation of any and all
agreements,  covenants, duties and obligations of Merger Sub and the Company
set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the Effective Time.

 

 

 

2  

1.4 _Tax Treatment_. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is intended
to constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The Parties adopt this  Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States
Treasury Regulations.

 

 

1.5 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company, each as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective  Time, shall automatically be amended and
restated in their entirety to read identically to the Certificate of
Incorporation and Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and such amended and restated Certificate of  Incorporation
and Bylaws shall become the respective Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation, except that the name of the Surviving
Corporation in such Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws shall be amended
to be  "Advent Technologies Inc." or such other name as agreed to by the
Company and Purchaser.

 

 

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective
Time, the board of directors and executive officers of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the board of  directors and executive officers of the
Purchaser, after giving effect to _Section 5.18_ , each to hold office in
accordance with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation until their respective successors are  duly elected or appointed
and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

 

 

1.7 _Amended Purchaser Charter_. Effective upon the Effective Time, the
Purchaser shall amend and restate its Certificate of Incorporation in a form
to be agreed upon by the Company  and the Purchaser, acting reasonably (the
"Amended Purchaser Charter"), which shall, among other matters, amend the
Purchaser's Certificate of Incorporation to (i) provide that the name of  the
Purchaser shall be changed to "Advent Technologies Holdings Inc.", or such
other name as mutually agreed to by the Purchaser and the Company, (ii)
provide for size and structure of the Post-Closing Purchaser Board in
accordance with _Section  5.18_ , and (iii) remove and change certain
provisions in the Certificate of Incorporation related to the Purchaser's
status as a blank check company.

 

 

1.8 _Merger Consideration_. As consideration for the Merger, the Company
Stockholders (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the holders of any
Company Convertible Securities who  convert or exercise their Company
Convertible Securities into shares of Company Stock prior to the Closing)
collectively shall be entitled to receive from the Purchaser, in the
aggregate, a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock with an  aggregate
value equal to (the "Merger Consideration") (i) Two Hundred Fifty Million U.S.
Dollars ($250,000,000), minus (ii) the amount of Closing Net Indebtedness,
with each share of  Purchaser Common Stock valued for such purposes at Ten
U.S. Dollars ($10.00) (as equitably adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, combinations, recapitalizations and the like after the Closing, the
"Merger Consideration Price Per Share").

 

 

1.9 _Effect of Merger on Company Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the holders
of any Company Securities  or the holders of any shares of capital stock of
the Purchaser or Merger Sub:

 

 

(a) Company Stock. Subject to clause (b) below, all shares of Company Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will 
automatically be cancelled and cease to exist in exchange for the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, with each Company Stockholder being entitled
to receive its Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration, without interest,
upon delivery of  the Transmittal Documents in accordance with _Section
1.10_. All shares of Company Preferred Stock will be treated on an as-
converted to Company Common Stock basis. As of the Effective Time, each
Company Stockholder shall cease to have any  other rights in and to the
Company or the Surviving Corporation (other than the rights set forth in
_Section 1.14_ below).

 

 

 

3  

(b) Treasury Stock. Notwithstanding clause (a) above or any other provision of
this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, if there  are any
Company Securities that are owned by the Company as treasury shares or any
Company Securities owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Securities shall be
canceled and  shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment
therefor.

 

 

(c) Dissenting Shares. Each of the Dissenting Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease  to
exist in accordance with _Section 1.14_ and shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the applicable payments set forth in _Section 1.14_.

 

 

(d) Company Convertible Securities. Any Company Convertible Security, if not
exercised or deemed converted prior to the Effective Time, shall be 
cancelled, retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to acquire,
be exchanged for or convert into shares of Company Stock, and the Company will
have no further Liability with respect thereto.

 

 

1.10 _Surrender of Company Stock and Disbursement of Merger Consideration_.

 

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall appoint its transfer
agent, Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, or another agent 
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), for the purpose
of exchanging the certificates representing Company Stock ("Company
Certificates") for the Merger Consideration. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent the Merger Consideration. As promptly as practicable after  the date
hereof, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to send, or to
cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each Company Stockholder, a letter of
transmittal for use in such exchange, in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
F_ (a  "Letter of Transmittal") (which shall specify that the delivery of
Company Certificates in respect of the Merger Consideration shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title shall pass,  only upon proper delivery of the
Company Certificates (or a Lost Certificate Affidavit) to the Exchange Agent).

 

 

(b) Each Company Stockholder shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata Share
of the Merger Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented by the
Company Certificate(s)  (excluding any shares of Company Stock described in
_Sections 1.9(b)_ or _1.9(c)_ ), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time and after delivery to the Exchange Agent of the following items
(collectively, the "Transmittal Documents"): (i) the Company Certificate(s)
for its Company Stock (or a Lost Certificate Affidavit), together with a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and  (ii) such
other related documents as may be reasonably requested by the Exchange Agent
or the Purchaser. Until so surrendered, each Company Certificate shall
represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only _the_ right to
receive such portion of the Merger Consideration attributable to such Company
Certificate.

 

 

(c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be delivered or issued to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company
Certificate is registered immediately  prior to the Effective Time, it shall
be a condition to such delivery that (i) the transfer of such Company Stock
shall have been permitted in accordance with the terms of the Company's
Organizational Documents and any stockholders agreement with  respect to the
Company, each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) such
Company Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper
form for transfer and, (iii) the recipient of such portion of the Merger 
Consideration, or the Person in whose name such portion of the Merger
Consideration is delivered or issued, shall have already executed and
delivered, if a Key Executive or certain other Company Stockholders,
counterparts to a Lock-Up Agreement and  Non-Competition Agreement, and such
other Transmittal Documents as are reasonably deemed necessary by the Exchange
Agent or the Purchaser and (iv) the Person requesting such delivery shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes  required as a result of
such delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

 

 

4  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in
lieu of delivery of a Company  Certificate to the Exchange Agent, the Company
Stockholder may instead deliver to the Exchange Agent an affidavit of lost
certificate and indemnity of loss in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Purchaser (a "Lost Certificate Affidavit"), which at the reasonable
discretion of the Purchaser may include a requirement that the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate deliver a bond in such sum as
it  may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the shares
of Company Stock represented by the Company Certificates alleged to have been
lost, stolen or  destroyed. Any Lost Certificate Affidavit properly delivered
in accordance with this _Section 1.10(d)_ shall be treated as a Company
Certificate for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Company Certificates
are presented to the Surviving  Corporation, the Purchaser or the Exchange
Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable portion of the
Merger Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this _Section 1.10_. No dividends  or other distributions declared
or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Purchaser Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders
of any Company Certificates that have not yet been surrendered  with respect
to the Purchaser Common Stock to be issued upon surrender thereof until the
holders of record of such Company Certificates shall surrender such
certificates (or provide a Lost Certificate Affidavit), if applicable, and
provide the  other Transmittal Documents. Subject to applicable Law,
following surrender of any such Company Certificates (or delivery of a Lost
Certificate Affidavit), if applicable, and delivery of the other Transmittal
Documents, Purchaser shall promptly  deliver to the record holders thereof,
without interest, the certificates representing the Purchaser Common Stock
issued in exchange therefor and the amount of any such dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time  theretofore paid
with respect to such Purchaser Common Stock.

 

 

(f) All securities issued upon the surrender of Company Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such  Company Stock. Any portion of the Merger
Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section
1.10(a)_ that remains unclaimed by Company Stockholders two (2) years after
the Effective Time shall be returned to the  Purchaser, upon demand, and any
such Company Stockholder who has not exchanged its Company Stock for the
applicable portion of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
_Section 1.10_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to  the
Purchaser for payment of the portion of the Merger Consideration in respect of
such shares of Company Stock without any interest thereon (but with any
dividends paid with respect thereto). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
the Surviving  Corporation, the Purchaser or any Party hereto shall be liable
to any Person for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fraction of
a share of Purchaser Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger or
the transactions contemplated  hereby, and each Person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a share of Purchaser Common Stock (after aggregating
all fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock that otherwise would be
received by such holder) shall instead be entitled  to receive for each such
fractional share an amount in cash, without interest, rounded down to the
nearest cent, equal to the product of (x) the amount of the fractional share
interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled but for this
_Section    1.10(g)_ , multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration Price Per
Share.

 

 

 

5  

1.11 _Effect of Transaction on Merger Sub Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or the
holders of any Company  Securities or the holders of any shares of capital
stock of the Purchaser or Merger Sub, each share of Merger Sub Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into an
equal number of shares of common stock of  the Surviving Corporation, with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

 

1.12 _Closing Calculations_. At least three (3)  Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement certified
by the Company's chief executive officer (the "Closing  Statement") setting
forth a good faith calculation of the Company's Closing Net Indebtedness and
the resulting Merger Consideration based on such calculation, in reasonable
detail including for each  component thereof, along with the amount owed to
each creditor of any of the Target Companies, and bank statements and other
evidence reasonably necessary to confirm such calculations. Promptly upon
delivering the Closing Statement to the  Purchaser, if requested by the
Purchaser, the Company will meet with the Purchaser to review and discuss the
Closing Statement and the Company will consider in good faith the Purchaser's
comments to the Closing Statement and make any  appropriate adjustments to
the Closing Statement to reflect any reasonable comments of the Purchaser
prior to the Closing, which adjusted Closing Statement, as mutually approved
by the Company and the Purchaser both acting reasonably and in  good faith,
shall thereafter become the Closing Statement for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Closing Statement and the determinations contained therein
shall be prepared in accordance with the Accounting Principles and otherwise
in  accordance with this Agreement.

 

 

1.13 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and  to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub, the officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub are fully authorized  in the name of
their respective corporations or otherwise to take, and will take, all such
lawful and necessary action, so long as such action is not inconsistent with
this Agreement.

 

 

1.14 _Appraisal and Dissenter 's Rights_. No Company Stockholder who has
validly exercised its appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (a
"Dissenting Stockholder") with respect to its Company Stock (such shares,
"Dissenting Shares") shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Merger 
Consideration with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting
Stockholder unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost its appraisal rights under the DGCL. Each
Dissenting Stockholder shall  be entitled to receive only the payment
resulting from the procedure set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL with respect
to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company
shall give the Purchaser and the Purchaser  Representative (i) prompt notice
of any written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received
by the Company relating to any Dissenting Stockholder's  rights of appraisal
and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of the Purchaser and the Purchaser 
Representative, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement,  for all purposes of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration shall be reduced by the Pro Rata Share of any Dissenting
Stockholders attributable to any Dissenting Shares and the Dissenting
Stockholders shall have no rights to any portion of the  Merger Consideration
with respect to any Dissenting Shares.

omit to state  a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The Public Certifications are each

any material respect by the Purchaser.

Purchaser. There is no material Action that the Purchaser has pending against
any other Person. The Purchaser is not subject to any material Orders of any
Governmental Authority, nor are any such  Orders pending. The Purchaser holds
all material Permits necessary to lawfully conduct its business as presently
conducted, and to own, lease and operate its assets and properties, all of
which are in full force and effect, except where the  failure to hold such
Consent or for such Consent to be in full force and effect would not

Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Internet Assets and applications owned or
licensed by a Target Company or  otherwise used or held for use by a Target
Company in which a Target Company is the owner, applicant or assignee
("Company Registered IP"), specifying as to each item, as applicable: (A) 
the nature of the item, including the title, (B) the owner of the item (with
respect to Company Registered IP licensed by a Target Company, to the
Company's Knowledge), (C) the jurisdictions in which the item is issued or
registered or in which an  application for issuance or registration has been
filed and (D) the issuance, registration or application numbers and dates; and
(ii) all material unregistered Intellectual Property owned or purported to be
owned by a Target Company. _Schedule  4.13(a)(ii)_ sets forth all
Intellectual Property licenses, sublicenses and other agreements or
permissions ("Company IP Licenses") (other than "shrink wrap," "click wrap,"
and "off  the shelf" software agreements and other agreements for Software
commercially available on reasonable terms to the public generally with
license, maintenance, support and other fees of less than $20,000 per year
(collectively, "Off-the-Shelf Software"), which are not required to be listed,
although such licenses are "Company IP Licenses" as that term is used herein),
under which a Target Company is a licensee or to  the Company's Knowledge is
otherwise authorized to use or practice any Intellectual Property, and
describes (A) the applicable Intellectual Property licensed, sublicensed or
used and (B) any royalties, license fees or other compensation due from a 
Target Company, if any. To the Company's Knowledge, each Target Company owns,
free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), has valid and
enforceable rights in, and has the unrestricted right to use, sell, license,
transfer or assign,  all Intellectual Property currently used, licensed or
held for use by such Target Company, and previously used or licensed by such
Target Company, except for the Intellectual Property that is the subject of
the Company IP Licenses. No item of  Company Registered IP that consists of a
pending Patent application fails to identify all pertinent inventors, and for
each Patent and Patent application in the Company Registered IP, the Target
Companies have obtained valid assignments of  inventions from each inventor.
Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.13(a)(iii)_ , all Company Registered IP is
owned exclusively by the applicable Target Company without obligation to pay
royalties, licensing fees or other fees, or otherwise  account to any third
party with respect to such Company Registered IP, and such Target Company has
recorded assignments of all Company Registered IP.

 

 

 

21  

(b) To the Company's Knowledge, each Target Company has a valid and
enforceable license to use all Intellectual Property that is the subject of
the Company IP Licenses applicable to such  Target Company. The Company IP
Licenses include all of the licenses, sublicenses and other agreements or
permissions necessary to operate the Target Companies as presently conducted.
Each Target Company has performed all material obligations  imposed on it in
the Company IP Licenses, has made all payments required to date, and such
Target Company is not, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is any other
party thereto, in breach or default thereunder, nor, to the Knowledge of the 
Company, has any event occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a default thereunder. The continued use by the Target
Companies of the Intellectual Property that is the subject of the Company IP
Licenses in the same  manner that it is currently being used is not
restricted by any applicable license of any Target Company. All registrations
for Copyrights, Patents, Trademarks and Internet Assets that are owned by or
exclusively licensed to any Target Company are  valid, in force and in good
standing with all required fees and maintenance fees having been paid with no
Actions pending, and, to the Company's Knowledge, all applications to register
any Copyrights, Patents and Trademarks are pending and in good  standing, all
without challenge of any kind. No Target Company is party to any Contract that
requires a Target Company to assign to any Person all of its rights in any
Intellectual Property developed by a Target Company under such Contract.

 

 

(c) _Schedule 4.13(c)_ sets forth all material licenses, sublicenses and other
agreements or permissions under which a Target Company is the licensor (each,
an "Outbound IP License"), and for each such Outbound IP License, describes
(i) the applicable Intellectual Property licensed, (ii) the licensee under
such Outbound IP License, and (iii) any  royalties, license fees or other
compensation due to a Target Company, if any. Each Target Company has
performed all material obligations imposed on it in the Outbound IP Licenses,
and such Target Company is not, nor, to the Knowledge of the  Company, is any
other party thereto, in breach or default thereunder, nor has any event
occurred that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default
thereunder.

 

 

(d) No Action is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge, threatened against a
Target Company that challenges the validity, enforceability, ownership, or
right to use, sell, license or  sublicense, or that otherwise relates to, any
Intellectual Property currently owned, licensed, used or held for use by the
Target Companies, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, is there any
reasonable basis for any such Action. No Target Company  has received any
written or, to the Knowledge of the Company, oral notice or claim asserting or
suggesting that any infringement, misappropriation, violation, dilution or
unauthorized use of the Intellectual Property of any other Person is or may 
be occurring or has or may have occurred, as a consequence of the business
activities of any Target Company, nor to the Knowledge of the Company is there
a reasonable basis therefor. There are no Orders to which any Target Company
is a party or is  otherwise bound that (i) restrict the rights of a Target
Company to use, transfer, license or enforce any Intellectual Property owned
by a Target Company, (ii) materially restrict the conduct of the business of a
Target Company in order to  accommodate a third Person's Intellectual
Property, or (iii) other than the Outbound IP Licenses, grant any third Person
any right with respect to any Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company.
No Target Company is currently infringing, or  has, in the past, infringed,
misappropriated or violated any Intellectual Property of any other Person in
any material respect in connection with the ownership, use or license of any
Intellectual Property owned or purported to be owned by a Target  Company or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, otherwise in connection with the conduct of
the respective businesses of the Target Companies. To the Company's Knowledge,
no third party is currently, or in the past three (3) years has been, 
infringing upon, misappropriating or otherwise violating any Intellectual
Property owned, licensed by, licensed to, or otherwise used or held for use by
any Target Company ("Company IP")  in any material respect.

 

 

 

22  

(e) All officers, directors, employees and independent contractors of a Target
Company (and each of their respective Affiliates) have assigned to the Target
Companies all Intellectual  Property arising from the services performed for
a Target Company by such Persons and all such assignments of Company
Registered IP have been recorded. No current or former officers, employees or
independent contractors of a Target Company have  claimed any ownership
interest in any Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company. To the
Knowledge of the Company, there has been no material violation of a Target
Company's policies or practices related to protection of Company IP or any 
confidentiality or nondisclosure Contract relating to the Intellectual
Property owned by a Target Company. The Company has made available to the
Purchaser true and complete copies of all written Contracts referenced in
subsections under which  employees and independent contractors assigned their
Intellectual Property to a Target Company. To the Company's Knowledge, none of
the employees of any Target Company is obligated under any Contract, or
subject to any Order, that would materially  interfere with the use of such
employee's best efforts to promote the interests of the Target Companies, or
that would materially conflict with the business of any Target Company as
presently conducted or contemplated to be conducted. Each Target  Company has
taken reasonable security measures in order to protect the secrecy,
confidentiality and value of the material Company IP.

 

 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, no Person has obtained unauthorized
access to third party information and data (including personally identifiable
information) in the possession of a  Target Company, nor has there been any
other material compromise of the security, confidentiality or integrity of
such information or data, and no written or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
oral complaint relating to an improper use or disclosure  of, or a breach in
the security of, any such information or data has been received by a Target
Company. Each Target Company has complied in all material respects with all
applicable Laws and Contract requirements relating to privacy, personal data 
protection, and the collection, processing and use of personal information and
its own privacy policies and guidelines. The operation of the business of the
Target Companies has not and does not violate any right to privacy or
publicity of any  third person, or constitute unfair competition or trade
practices under applicable Law.

 

 

(g) The consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not result in the material breach, material modification, cancellation,
termination, suspension of, or  acceleration of any payments with respect to,
or release of source code because of (i) any Contract providing for the
license or other use of Intellectual Property owned by a Target Company, or
(ii) any Company IP License. Following the Closing,  the Company shall be
permitted to exercise, directly or indirectly through its Subsidiaries, all of
the Target Companies' rights under such Contracts or Company IP Licenses to
the same extent that the Target Companies would have been able to  exercise
had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not occurred, without the
payment of any additional amounts or consideration other than ongoing fees,
royalties or payments which the Target Companies would otherwise be required
to pay  in the absence of such transactions.

 

 

 

23

applicable statute of limitations to assess any amount of Taxes other than
such waivers or extensions entered into in  the ordinary course of business.

time within which to file any Tax Return or within which to pay any Taxes
shown to be due on any Tax Return other than any requests made in  the

in such Person's agreement with a Target Company, a copy of which has been
provided to the Purchaser by the Company. For the purposes of applicable Law,
including the Code, all independent contractors who are currently, or within
the  last five (5) years have been, engaged by a Target Company are bona fide
independent contractors and not employees of a Target Company. Each
independent contractor is terminable on fewer than thirty (30) days' notice,
without any obligation of any  Target Company to pay severance or a
termination fee.

 

 

4.19 _Benefit Plans_.

 

 

(a) Set forth on _Schedule 4.19(a)_ is a true and complete list of each
Benefit Plan of a Target Company (each, a "Company Benefit  Plan"). With
respect to each Company Benefit Plan, there are no funded benefit obligations
for which contributions have not been made or properly accrued and there are
no unfunded benefit obligations that have not been accounted for by 
reserves, or otherwise properly footnoted in accordance with GAAP on the
Company Financials. No Target Company is or has in the past been a member of a
"controlled group" for purposes of Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the
Code, nor does any  Target Company have any Liability with respect to any
collectively-bargained for plans, whether or not subject to the provisions of
ERISA. No statement, either written or oral, has been made by any Target
Company to any Person with regard to any  Company Benefit Plan that was not
in accordance with the Company Benefit Plan in any material respect.

 

 

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan is and has been operated at all times in
compliance with all applicable Laws in all material respects, including ERISA
and the Code. Each Company Benefit Plan  which is intended to be "qualified"
within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code (i) has been determined by
the IRS to be so qualified (or is based on a prototype plan which has received
a favorable opinion letter) during the period from its  adoption to the date
of this Agreement and (ii) its related trust has been determined to be exempt
from taxation under Section 501(a) of the Code or the Target Companies have
requested an initial favorable IRS determination of qualification and/or 
exemption within the period permitted by applicable Law. To the Knowledge of
the Company, no fact exists which could materially adversely affect the
qualified status of such Company Benefit Plans or the exempt status of such
trusts.

 

 

 

27  

(c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which covers any current or
former officer, director, consultant or employee (or beneficiary thereof) of a
Target Company, the Company has  provided to Purchaser accurate and complete
copies, if applicable, of: (i) all Company Benefit Plan texts and agreements
and related trust agreements or annuity Contracts (including any amendments,
modifications or supplements thereto); (ii) all  summary plan descriptions
and material modifications thereto; (iii) the three (3) most recent Forms
5500, if applicable, and annual report, including all schedules thereto; (iv)
the most recent annual and periodic accounting of plan assets; (v) the  three
(3) most recent nondiscrimination testing reports; (vi) the most recent
determination letter received from the IRS, if any; (vii) the most recent
actuarial valuation; and (viii) all material communications with any
Governmental Authority.

 

 

(d) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan: (i) such Company Benefit Plan
has been administered and enforced in all material respects in accordance with
its terms, the Code and ERISA;  (ii) no material breach of fiduciary duty has
occurred; (iii) no Action is pending, or to the Company's Knowledge,
threatened (other than routine claims for benefits arising in the ordinary
course of administration); (iv) no prohibited transaction,  as defined in
Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, has occurred, excluding
transactions effected pursuant to a statutory or administration exemption; and
(v) all contributions and premiums due through the Closing Date have been made
in  all material respects as required under ERISA or have been fully accrued
in all material respects on the Company Financials.

 

 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan is a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Section
414(j) of the Code), a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA) or a "multiple employer  plan" (as described in Section 413(c) of the
Code) or is otherwise subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code,
and no Target Company has incurred any Liability or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, otherwise could have any Liability,  contingent or otherwise, under
Title IV of ERISA and no condition presently exists that is expected to cause
such Liability to be incurred. No Company Benefit Plan will become a multiple
employer plan with respect to any Target Company immediately  after the
Closing Date. No Target Company currently maintains or has ever maintained, or
is required currently or has ever been required to contribute to or otherwise
participate in, a multiple employer welfare arrangement or voluntary
employees'  beneficiary association as defined in Section 501(c)(9) of the
Code.

 

 

(f) There is no arrangement under any Company Benefit Plan with respect to any
employee that would result in the payment of any amount that by operation of
Sections 280G or 162(m) of the  Code would not be deductible by the Target
Companies and no arrangement exists pursuant to which a Target Company will be
required to "gross up" or otherwise compensate any person because of the
imposition of any excise tax on a payment to such  person.

 

 

(g) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which is a "welfare plan" (as
described in Section 3(1) of ERISA): (i) no such plan provides medical or
death benefits with respect to current  or former employees of a Target
Company beyond their termination of employment (other than coverage mandated
by Law, which is paid solely by such employees); and (ii) there are no
reserves, assets, surplus or prepaid premiums under any such plan.   Each
Target Company has complied with the provisions of Section 601 et seq. of
ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code.

 

 

(h) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents will not: (i) entitle any individual to severance pay,
unemployment compensation or other  benefits or compensation; (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting, or increase the amount of any compensation
due, or in respect of, any individual; or (iii) result in or satisfy a
condition to the payment of compensation that would, in  combination with any
other payment, result in an "excess parachute payment" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. No Target Company has incurred any Liability for any
Tax imposed under Chapter 43 of the Code or civil liability under  Section
502(i) or (l) of ERISA.

 

 

 

28  

(i) Except to the extent required by Section 4980B of the Code or similar
state Law, no Target Company provides health or welfare benefits to any former
or retired employee or is  obligated to provide such benefits to any active
employee following such employee's retirement or other termination of
employment or service.

 

 

(j) All Company Benefit Plans can be terminated at any time as of or after the
Closing Date without resulting in any Liability to the Surviving Corporation
or Purchaser or their  respective Affiliates for any additional
contributions, penalties, premiums, fees, fines, excise taxes or any other
charges or liabilities.

 

 

(k) Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code
(each, a "Section 409A Plan") as of the Closing Date is  indicated as such on
_Schedule 4.19(k)_. No Company Options or other equity-based awards have been
issued or granted by the Company that are, or are subject to, a Section 409A
Plan. Each Section 409A Plan has been administered in  compliance, and is in
documentary compliance, with the applicable provisions of Section 409A of the
Code, the regulations thereunder and other official guidance issued
thereunder. No Target Company has any obligation to any employee or other 
service provider with respect to any Section 409A Plan that may be subject to
any Tax under Section 409A of the Code. No payment to be made under any
Section 409A Plan is, or to the Knowledge of the Company will be, subject to
the penalties of  Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code. There is no Contract or
plan to which any Target Company is a party or by which it is bound to
compensate any employee, consultant or director for penalty taxes paid
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

 

4.20 _Environmental Matters_. Except as set forth in _Schedule 4.20_ :

 

 

(a) Each Target Company is and has been in compliance in all material respects
with all applicable Environmental Laws, including obtaining, maintaining in
good standing, and complying in  all material respects with all Permits
required for its business and operations by Environmental Laws ("Environmental
Permits"), no Action is pending or, to the Company's Knowledge,  threatened
to revoke, modify, or terminate any such Environmental Permit, and, to the
Company's Knowledge, no facts, circumstances, or conditions currently exist
that could adversely affect such continued compliance with Environmental Laws
and  Environmental Permits or require capital expenditures to achieve or
maintain such continued compliance with Environmental Laws and Environmental
Permits.

 

 

(b) No Target Company is the subject of any outstanding Order or Contract with
any Governmental Authority or other Person in respect of any (i) Environmental
Laws, (ii) Remedial Action, or  (iii) Release or threatened Release of a
Hazardous Material. No Target Company has assumed, contractually or by
operation of Law, any Liabilities or obligations under any Environmental Laws.

 

 

(c) No Action has been made or is pending, or to the Company's Knowledge,

Liability under any Environmental Law.

 

 

(d) No Target Company has manufactured, treated, stored, disposed of, arranged
for or permitted the disposal of, generated, handled or Released any Hazardous
Material, or owned or operated  any property or facility, in a manner that
has given or would reasonably be expected to give rise to any material
Liability or obligation under applicable Environmental Laws. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no fact, circumstance, or condition  exists in respect of any
Target Company or any property currently or formerly owned, operated, or
leased by any Target Company or any property to which a Target Company
arranged for the disposal or treatment of Hazardous Materials that could 
reasonably be expected to result in a Target Company incurring any material
Environmental Liabilities.

 

 

 

29  

(e) To the Company's Knowledge, there is no investigation of the business,
operations, or currently owned, operated, or leased property of a Target
Company or previously owned, operated,  or leased property of a Target
Company pending or threatened that could lead to the imposition of any Liens
under any Environmental Law or material Environmental Liabilities.

 

 

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, there is not located at any of the
properties of a Target Company any (i) underground storage tanks, (ii)
asbestos-containing material, or (iii)  equipment containing polychlorinated
biphenyls.

 

 

(g) The Company has provided to the Purchaser all environmentally related site
assessments, audits, studies, reports, analysis and results of investigations
that have been performed in  respect of the currently or previously owned,
leased, or operated properties of any Target Company, in each case that are in
the Company's possession.

 

 

4.21 _Transactions with Related Persons_. Except as set forth on _Schedule
4.21_ , no Target Company nor any of its Affiliates, nor any officer,
director, manager, employee,  trustee or beneficiary of a Target Company or
any of its Affiliates, nor any immediate family member of any of the foregoing
(whether directly or indirectly through an Affiliate of such Person) (each of
the foregoing, a "Related Person") is presently, or in the past three (3)
years, has been, a party to any transaction with a Target Company, including
any Contract or other arrangement (a) providing for the furnishing of
services  by (other than as officers, directors or employees of the Target
Company), (b) providing for the rental of real property or Personal Property
from or (c) otherwise requiring payments to (other than for services or
expenses as directors, officers or  employees of the Target Company in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice) any Related Person
or any Person in which any Related Person has an interest as an owner,
officer, manager, director, trustee or partner or in which  any Related
Person has any direct or indirect interest (other than the ownership of
securities representing no more than two percent (2%) of the outstanding
voting power or economic interest of a publicly traded company). Except as set
forth on _Schedule    4.21_ , no Target Company has outstanding any
Contract or other arrangement or commitment with any Related Person, and no
Related Person owns any real property or Personal Property, or right, tangible
or intangible (including Intellectual  Property) which is used in the
business of any Target Company. The assets of the Target Companies do not
include any material receivable or other obligation from a Related Person, and
the liabilities of the Target Companies do not include any  material payable

insurer, coverage period, coverage amount, annual premium and type of policy)
held by a Target Company relating  to a Target Company or its business,
properties, assets, directors, officers and employees, copies of which have
been provided to the Purchaser. All premiums due and payable under all such
insurance policies have been timely paid and the Target  Companies are
otherwise in material compliance with the terms of such insurance policies. To
the Company's Knowledge, each such insurance policy (i) is legal, valid,
binding, enforceable and in full force and effect and (ii) will continue to
be  legal, valid, binding, enforceable, and in full force and effect on
identical terms following the Closing. No Target Company has any self-
insurance or co-insurance programs. In the past three (3) years, no Target

relating to or involving any adverse change or any change other than in the
ordinary course of business, in the conditions of insurance, any refusal to
issue an insurance policy or non-renewal of a  policy.

 

 

(b) _Schedule 4.22(b)_ identifies each individual insurance claim in excess of
$50,000 made by a Target Company in the past three (3) years. Each Target
Company  has reported to its insurers all claims and pending circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to result in a claim, except where such
failure to report such a claim would not be reasonably likely to be material
to the Target Companies, taken  as a whole. To the Knowledge of the Company,
no event has occurred, and no condition or circumstance exists, that would
reasonably be expected to (with or without notice or lapse of time) give rise
to or serve as a basis for the denial of any such  insurance claim. In the
past three (3) years, no Target Company has made any claim against an
insurance policy as to which the insurer is denying coverage.

not reserved against in the Financial Statements. No Target Company has sold
any products or delivered any services that included a warranty for a period
of longer than one year.

arising out of any injury to individuals or property as a result of the
ownership, possession, or use of any  product designed, manufactured,
assembled, repaired, maintained, delivered, sold or installed, or services
rendered, by or on behalf of a Target Company. No Target Company has committed
any act or omission which would reasonably be expected to  result in, and
there has been no occurrence which would reasonably be expected to give rise
to or form the basis of, any material product Liability or material Liability
for breach of warranty (whether covered by insurance or not) on the part of
a  Target Company with respect to products designed, manufactured, assembled,
repaired, maintained, delivered, sold or installed or services rendered by or
on behalf of a Target Company.

5.18 _Post-Closing Board of Directors and Executive Officers_.

 

 

(a) The Parties shall take all necessary action, including causing the
directors of the Purchaser to resign, so that effective as of the Closing,
the  Purchaser's board of directors (the "Post-Closing Purchaser Board") will
consist of nine (9) individuals. Immediately  after the Closing, the Parties
shall take all necessary action to designate and appoint to the Post-Closing
Purchaser Board (i) the three (3) persons that are designated by the Purchaser
prior to the Closing (the "Purchaser Directors"), at least one (1) of whom
shall be required to qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules,
and (ii) the six (6) persons that are designated by the Company prior to the 
Closing (the "Company Directors"), at least four (4) of whom shall be required
to qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules. Pursuant to the
Amended Purchaser Charter as  in effect as of the Closing, the Post-Closing
Purchaser Board will be a classified board with three classes of directors,
with (I) one class of directors, the Class I Directors, initially serving a
one (1) year term, such term effective from  the Closing (but any subsequent
Class I Directors serving a three (3) year term), (II) a second class of
directors, the Class II Directors, initially serving a two (2) year term, such
term effective from the Closing (but any subsequent Class  II Directors
serving a three (3) year term), and (III) a third class of directors, the
Class III Directors, serving a three (3) year term, such term effective from
the Closing. One of the Purchaser Directors shall be a Class I Director, one

director on the Post-Closing Purchaser Board may be removed without cause.
The  Parties shall also take all necessary action, including causing the
directors and officers of the Company to resign effective as of the Closing,

Closing Purchaser Board with a customary director indemnification agreement,
in form and substance reasonable  acceptable to such director, to be
effective upon the Closing (or if later, such director's appointment).

 

 

(b) The Parties shall take all action necessary, including causing the
executive officers of Purchaser to resign, so that the individuals serving as
the chief executive officer and  chief financial officer, respectively, of
Purchaser immediately after the Closing will be the same individuals (in the

at its sole discretion, the Company desires  to appoint another qualified
person to either such role, in which case, such other person identified by the
Company shall serve in such role).

enterprise at the  request of the Purchaser or Merger Sub (the "DandO

or under any indemnification, employment or other  similar agreements between
any DandO Indemnified Person and the Purchaser or Merger Sub, in each case as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Closing and continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their  respective terms to the
extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after the
Effective Time, the Purchaser shall cause the Organizational Documents of the
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation to contain provisions  no less
favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of and advancement
of expenses to DandO Indemnified Persons than are set forth as of the date of
this Agreement in the Organizational Documents of the Purchaser and Merger 
Sub to the extent permitted by applicable Law. The provisions of this _Section
5.19_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified 
Persons and their respective heirs and representatives.

 

 

(b) For the benefit of the Purchaser's and Merger Sub's directors and
officers, the Purchaser shall be permitted prior to the Effective Time to
obtain and  fully pay the premium for a "tail" insurance policy that provides
coverage for up to a six-year period from and after the Effective Time for
events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "DandO Tail Insurance") that
is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the
aggregate than the Purchaser's existing policy or, if substantially equivalent
insurance coverage is unavailable, the  best available coverage. If obtained,
the Purchaser shall maintain the DandO Tail Insurance in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder, and the Purchaser shall
timely pay or caused to be paid all premiums  with respect to the DandO Tail
Insurance.

 

 

5.20 _Trust Account Proceeds_. The Parties agree that after the Closing, the
funds in the Trust Account, after taking  into account payments for the

the Purchaser's accrued Expenses, (iii) the Purchaser's deferred Expenses
(including cash amounts payable to the IPO Underwriter and any legal fees) of
the IPO, (iv) any loans owed by the Purchaser to Orion Resource  Partners
(USA) LP, a Delaware limited partnership, (v) any loans owed by the Purchaser
to the Sponsor for any Expenses (including deferred Expenses), other
administrative costs and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Purchaser
or  Extension Expenses and (vi) any other Liabilities of the Purchaser due
and payable as of the Closing. Such Expenses, as well as any Expenses that are
required to be paid by delivery of the Purchaser's securities, will be paid at
the  Closing. Any remaining cash will be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes of the Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation.

to a private equity investment in Purchaser to purchase shares of Purchaser in
connection with a  private placement, and/or enter into backstop arrangements
with potential investors, in either case on terms mutually agreeable to the
Company and Purchaser, acting reasonably (a "PIPE  Investment"), and, if
Purchaser elects, with the Company's consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned), to seek a PIPE Investment, Purchaser and the Company
shall, and shall cause their respective  Representatives to, cooperate with
each other and their respective Representatives in connection with such PIPE
Investment and use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
such PIPE Investment to occur (including having the  Company's senior
management participate in any investor meetings and roadshows as reasonably
requested by Purchaser).

 

 

5.22 _Required Extension_. Purchaser hereby agrees that it will seek, and use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, from  its stockholders an Extension
(the "Required Extension") of its current deadline to consummate a Business
Combination of October 20, 2020, with such Required Extension to be to 
February 22, 2021 unless otherwise consented to by the Company (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), or such other period
as agreed by Purchaser and the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
anything  else to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser may, but shall
not be required to, pay additional amounts to the Trust Account in connection
with any Extension.

 

 

5.23 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Purchaser's board of
directors, or an appropriate committee of "non-employee directors" (as 
defined in Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act) thereof, shall adopt a
resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the
acquisition of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement and the other
agreements  contemplated hereby, by any person owning securities of the
Company who is expected to become a director or officer (as defined under Rule
16a-1(f) under the Exchange Act) of Purchaser following the Closing shall be

Effective Time, certified by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

6.4 _Frustration of Conditions_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, no Party may rely on the failure of any condition set  forth in
this _Article VI_ to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the failure of

ARTICLE VII

 

_TERMINATION AND EXPENSES_

 

 

7.1 _Termination_.       This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Closing as follows:

 

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Purchaser and the Company;

 

 

(b) by written notice by the Purchaser or the Company if any of the conditions
to the Closing set forth in _Article VI_ have not been satisfied or  waived
on or prior to October 20, 2020 (the "Outside Date"); provided, that if the
Required Extension is obtained, the Outside Date shall  also be extended to
the same date as such Required Extension requires a Business Combination be
completed by; provided, further the right to terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 7.1(b)_   shall not be available to a Party if the breach or
violation by such Party or its Affiliates of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement was the cause of, or resulted in,
the failure of the Closing to occur on  or before the Outside Date;

 

 

(c) by written notice by either the Purchaser or the Company if a Governmental
Authority of  competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or other action
has become final and  non-appealable; provided, however, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(c)_ shall not be
available to a Party if the failure by such Party or its Affiliates  to
comply with any provision of this Agreement has been a substantial cause of,
or substantially resulted in, such action by such Governmental Authority;

 

 

(d) by written notice by the Company to Purchaser, if (i) there has been a
breach by the Purchaser of any of its representations, warranties, covenants
or  agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of the Purchaser shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in any case,
which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.2(a)_
or _Section      6.2(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for
such purposes as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such
breach), and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is
not cured within the earlier  of (A) twenty (20) days after written notice of
such breach or inaccuracy is provided to the Purchaser or (B) the Outside
Date; provided, that the Company shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section  7.1(d)_ if at such time the Company is
in material uncured breach of this Agreement;

 

 

(e) by written notice by the Purchaser to the Company, if (i) there has been a
breach by the Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants 
or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or
warranty of such Parties shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in any case,
which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 6.3(a)_
or _Section      6.3(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for
such purposes as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such
breach), and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is
not cured within the earlier  of (A) twenty (20) days after written notice of
such breach or inaccuracy is provided to the Company or (B) the Outside Date;
provided, that the Purchaser shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section  7.1(e)_ if at such time the Purchaser is
in material uncured breach of this Agreement;

 

 

 

53  

(f) by written notice by the Company to the Purchaser, if there shall have
been a Material Adverse Effect on the Purchaser following the date of this
Agreement which is uncured and  continuing;

 

 

(g) by written notice by the Purchaser to the Company, if there shall have
been a Material Adverse Effect on the Target Companies taken as a whole
following the date of this  Agreement which is uncured and continuing;

 

 

(h) by written notice by either the Purchaser or the Company to the other, if
the Purchaser Special Meeting is held (including any adjournment or
postponement thereof) and has  concluded, the Purchaser's stockholders have
duly voted, and the Required Purchaser Shareholder Approval was not obtained;

 

 

(i) by written notice by either the Purchaser or the Company to the other, if
the Company Special Meeting is held (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof) and has  concluded, the Company Stockholders have duly voted, and
the Required Company Stockholder Approval was not obtained; or

 

 

(j) by written notice by either the Purchaser or the Company to the other if
the Required Extension shall have not been obtained on or prior to October 20,
2020.

 

 

7.2 _Effect of Termination_. This Agreement may only be  terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section 7.1_ and pursuant to a written notice
delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable Parties, which sets
forth the basis for such termination, including the provision of
_Section      7.1_ under which such termination is made. In the event of
the valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_ , this
Agreement shall forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability on the
part of any Party or  any of their respective Representatives, and all rights
and obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i) _Sections 5.15_ ,
_5.16_ , _7.3_ , _8.1_ , _Article IX_ and this _Section 7.2_ shall survive
the  termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from Liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement prior to termination of this
Agreement (in each  case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to _Section
8.1_ ). Without limiting the foregoing, and except as provided in _Sections
7.3_ and this _Section 7.2_ (but subject to _Section 8.1_ ) and subject to the
right to  seek injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief in
accordance with _Section 9.7_ , the Parties' sole right prior to the Closing
with respect to any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement  contained in this Agreement by another Party or with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be the right, if
applicable, to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_.

 

 

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Subject to _Sections 8.1_ , _9.14_ and _9.15_   all
Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses. As
used in this Agreement, "Expenses"  shall include all out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
financial advisors, financing sources, experts and consultants to a Party
hereto or any of its Affiliates) incurred by a  Party or on its behalf in
connection with or related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any Ancillary Document related
hereto and all other matters related to the consummation of this  Agreement.
With respect to the Purchaser, Expenses shall include any and all deferred
expenses (including fees or commissions payable to the underwriters and any
legal fees) of the IPO upon consummation of a Business Combination, any
costs  and expenses incurred by Purchaser in connection with any PIPE
Investment and any Extension Expenses. With respect to the Company, Expenses
shall include any payments pursuant to the Transaction Bonus Agreements or
Employment Agreements due  at or prior to the Closing.

 

 

 

54  

ARTICLE VIII

 

_WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

 

 

8.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the IPO Prospectus.
The  Company and the Seller Representative each hereby represents and
warrants that it has read the IPO Prospectus and understands that Purchaser
has established the Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and the
overallotment shares  acquired by Purchaser's underwriters and from certain
private placements occurring simultaneously with the IPO (including interest
accrued from time to time thereon) for the benefit of Purchaser's public
shareholders (including overallotment  shares acquired by Purchaser's
underwriters) (the "Public Stockholders") and that, except as otherwise
described in the IPO Prospectus, Purchaser may disburse monies from the
Trust  Account only: (a) to the Public Stockholders in the event they elect
to redeem their shares of Purchaser Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of its initial business combination (as such term is used in the
IPO Prospectus) ("Business Combination") or in connection with an amendment to
Purchaser's Organizational Documents to extend Purchaser's deadline to
consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the Public  Stockholders if the
Purchaser fails to consummate a Business Combination within 18 months after
the closing of the IPO, which has since been extended to October 20, 2020, and
will upon the Required Extension be further extended to February  22, 2021,
and is subject to further extension by amendment to Purchaser's Organizational
Documents, (c) with respect to any interest earned on the amounts held in the
Trust Account, amounts necessary to pay for any taxes and up to $100,000 in 
dissolution expenses, and (d) to Purchaser after or concurrently with the
consummation of a Business Combination. For and in consideration of Purchaser
entering into this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt  and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, each of the
Company and the Seller Representative hereby agrees on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, none of the Company or  the Seller Representative nor any of their
respective Affiliates do now or shall at any time hereafter have any right,
title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account
or distributions therefrom, or make any claim  against the Trust Account
(including any distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such claim
arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to, this
Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between  Purchaser
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Company, the Seller
Representative or any of their respective Representatives, on the other hand,
or any other matter, and regardless of whether such claim arises based on 
contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal liability (collectively,
the "Released Claims"). Each of the Company and the Seller Representative on
behalf of itself and its  Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released
Claims that any such Party or any of its Affiliates may have against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a
result of, or arising out of, any  negotiations, contracts or agreements with
Purchaser or its Representatives and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including any distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever
(including for an alleged breach of this  Agreement or any other agreement
with Purchaser or its Affiliates). The Company and the Seller Representative
each agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is material to this
Agreement and specifically relied upon by Purchaser  and its Affiliates to
induce Purchaser to enter in this Agreement, and each of the Company and the
Seller Representative further intends and understands such waiver to be valid,
binding and enforceable against such Party and each of its  Affiliates under
applicable Law. To the extent that the Company or the Seller Representative or
any of their respective Affiliates commences any Action based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to 
Purchaser or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part,
monetary relief against Purchaser or its Representatives, each of the Company
and the Seller Representative hereby acknowledges and agrees that its and
its  Affiliates' sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust
Account and that such claim shall not permit such Party or any of its
Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of
them) to have any claim  against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. In the event that
the Company or the Seller Representative or any of their respective Affiliates
commences Action based upon, in connection  with, relating to or arising out
of any matter relating to Purchaser or its Representatives which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, relief against the Trust Account (including any
distributions therefrom) or the Public Stockholders,  whether in the form of
money damages or injunctive relief, Purchaser and its Representatives, as
applicable, shall be entitled to recover from the Company, the Seller
Representative and their respective Affiliates, as applicable, the 
associated legal fees and costs in connection with any such Action, in the
event Purchaser or its Representatives, as applicable, prevails in such
Action. This _Section 8.1_ shall survive termination of this Agreement for any
reason  and continue indefinitely.

9.3 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to  the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser and the Company (and after the  Closing, the
Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative), and any assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; provided that no such assignment
shall relieve the assigning Party  of its obligations hereunder.

 

 

9.4 _Third Parties_. Except for the rights of the DandO Indemnified Persons set
forth in _Section 5.19_ , which  the Parties acknowledge and agree are
express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, nothing contained in this
Agreement or in any instrument or document executed by any party in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby  shall create any rights in, or be
deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is not a
Party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a Party.

 

 

9.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
construed and enforced in accordance with the  Laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof. All Actions arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively
in any state or federal court located in New York,  New York (or in any
appellate court thereof) (the "Specified Courts"). Each Party hereto hereby
(a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any Specified Court for the
purpose of  any Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought
by any Party hereto and (b) irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert by
way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is
not subject personally  to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that
its property is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the Action
is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Action is improper,
or that this Agreement or the  transactions contemplated hereby may not be
enforced in or by any Specified Court. Each Party agrees that a final judgment
in any Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions
by suit on the judgment or in any other  manner provided by Law. Each Party
irrevocably consents to the service of the summons and complaint and any other
process in any other Action relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, on behalf of itself, or its property,  by personal delivery of
copies of such process to such Party at the applicable address set forth in
_Section 9.2_. Nothing in this _Section 9.5_ shall affect the right of any
Party to serve legal process in any other manner  permitted by Law.

 

 

 

58  

9.6 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH  PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
WITH RESPECT TO ANY ACTION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN
CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE  TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH
PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF ANY ACTION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THAT  FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION      9.6_.

 

 

9.7 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the  rights of each
Party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are unique,
recognizes and affirms that in the event of a breach of this Agreement by any
Party, money damages may be inadequate and the non-breaching Parties may
have  not adequate remedy at law, and agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed by an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached.   Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek
an injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to seek to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without the
requirement to post any bond or other  security or to prove that money
damages would be inadequate, this being in addition to any other right or
remedy to which such Party may be entitled under this Agreement, at law or in
equity.

 

 

9.8 _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in a  jurisdiction, such provision shall be
modified or deleted, as to the jurisdiction involved, only to the extent
necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the remaining  provisions hereof shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby nor shall the validity, legality or
enforceability of such provision be affected thereby in any other
jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other  provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties will substitute
for any invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable
provision that carries out, so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable, 
the intent and purpose of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

 

 

9.9 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified only
by execution of a written instrument signed by the Purchaser, the  Company,
the Purchaser Representative and the Seller Representative.

 

 

9.10 _Waiver_. The Purchaser on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, the
Company on behalf of itself and its Affiliates, and the Seller
Representative  on behalf of itself and the Company Stockholders, may in its
sole discretion (i) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or
other act of any other non-Affiliated Party hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracy
in the representations and  warranties by such other non-Affiliated Party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive
compliance by such other non-Affiliated Party with any covenant or condition
contained herein. Any such extension or  waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby (including by the Purchaser Representative or the Seller
Representative in lieu of such Party to the extent provided in  this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by a Party in
exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of
any  other right hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver of any
provision of this Agreement after the Closing shall also require the prior
written consent of the Purchaser Representative.

 

 

 

59  

9.11 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the documents or instruments
referred to herein, including any exhibits and  schedules attached hereto,
which exhibits and schedules are incorporated herein by reference, together
with the Ancillary Documents, embody the entire agreement and understanding of
the Parties hereto in respect of the subject matter  contained herein. There
are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants or
undertakings, other than those expressly set forth or referred to herein or
the documents or instruments referred to herein, which collectively 
supersede all prior agreements and the understandings among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter contained herein.

 

 

9.12 _Interpretation_. The table of contents and the Article and Section
headings contained  in this Agreement are solely for the purpose of
reference, are not part of the agreement of the Parties and shall not in any
way affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. In this Agreement,

9.16 _Legal Representation_.

 

 

(a) The Parties agree that, notwithstanding the fact that EGS may have, prior
to Closing, jointly represented the Purchaser, Merger Sub, the Purchaser
Representative and/or the  Sponsor in connection with this Agreement, the
Ancillary Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, and
has also represented the Purchaser and/or its Affiliates in connection with
matters other than the transaction that  is the subject of this Agreement,
EGS will be permitted in the future, after Closing, to represent the Sponsor,
the Purchaser Representative or their respective Affiliates in connection with
matters in which such Persons are adverse to the  Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates, including any disputes arising out of, or related to, this
Agreement. The Company and the Seller Representative, who are or have the
right to be represented by independent counsel in connection with the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, hereby agree, in advance, to
waive (and to cause their Affiliates to waive) any actual or potential
conflict of interest that may hereafter arise in connection with EGS's future
representation of  one or more of the Sponsor, the Purchaser Representative
or their respective Affiliates in which the interests of such Person are
adverse to the interests of the Purchaser, the Company and/or the Seller
Representative or any of their  respective Affiliates, including any matters
that arise out of this Agreement or that are substantially related to this
Agreement or to any prior representation by EGS of the Purchaser, Merger Sub,
any Sponsor, the Purchaser Representative or  any of their respective
Affiliates. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, for the purposes of the
attorney-client privilege, the Sponsor and the Purchaser Representative shall
be deemed the clients of EGS with respect to the negotiation,  execution and
performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. All such
communications shall remain privileged after the Closing and the privilege and
the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall belong solely to
the  Sponsor and the Purchaser Representative, shall be controlled by the
Sponsor and the Purchaser Representative and shall not pass to or be claimed
by Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation; provided, further,  that nothing
contained herein shall be deemed to be a waiver by the Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and
its Affiliates) of any applicable privileges or protections that can or  may
be asserted to prevent disclosure of any such communications to any third
party.

 

 

(b) Recognizing that Ropes and Gray LLP ("RandG") has acted as legal  counsel to
the Seller Representative, its Affiliates and the Target Companies prior to
the Closing, and that RandG intends to act as legal counsel to the Seller
Representative and its Affiliates after the Closing, Purchaser, Purchaser 
Representative and the Company (on its own behalf and on behalf of each Target
Company) hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to waive, any
conflicts that may arise in connection with RandG representing the Seller
Representative  and/or its Affiliates after the Closing as such
representation may relate to Purchaser, any Target Company or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the Ancillary Documents.
All communications involving  attorney-client confidences between Seller
Representative, its Affiliates or any Target Company, on the one hand, and
RandG, on the other hand, in the course of the preparations, planning,
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the  transactions contemplated
hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to
Seller Representative. Accordingly, without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative, the Target Companies shall not have  access to any
such communications, or to the files of RandG relating to engagement, if the
Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
upon and after the Closing, (i) Seller Representative shall be the  sole
holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to such engagement, and
none of the Target Companies shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent
that files of RandG in respect of such engagement constitute property of the 
client, only Seller Representative (and not the Target Companies) shall hold
such property rights and (iii) RandG shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the
Target  Companies by reason of any attorney-client relationship between RandG
and any of the Target Companies or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
in the event that a dispute arises between Purchaser, the Target Companies or
any of their  Affiliates and a third party (other than a Party or any of its
Affiliates) after the Closing, the Target Companies may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure of confidential attorney-client
communications by RandG to  such third party.
