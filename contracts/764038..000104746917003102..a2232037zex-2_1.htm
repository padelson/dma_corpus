(" _Parent_ "). Certain capitalized terms have the meanings given to such
terms in _Article IX_.

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the boards of directors of the Company and Parent have

 **WHEREAS** , the boards of directors of the Company and Parent have adopted
this Agreement and approved the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger and the Bank Merger (collectively, the " _Transactions_ "), and the
board of directors of each of the Company and Parent has resolved to recommend
that the shareholders of each of the Company and Parent, respectively, approve
this Agreement and the Transactions, including the Merger;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , for federal income Tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger
shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this
Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a plan of reorganization for
purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , as a condition and inducement to Parents willingness to enter
into this Agreement, certain shareholders of the Company have simultaneously
herewith entered into Voting Agreements substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit A_ (each, a " _Voting Agreement_ ," and collectively, the
" _Voting Agreements_ ") in connection with the Merger; and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the parties desire to make certain representations, warranties
and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 



 

 **NOW, THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
for other good and valuable consideration, and intending to be legally bound,
the parties agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I 
THE MERGER**

 



 

1.1 _The Merger_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, in
accordance with the North Carolina Business Corporation Act (the " _NCBCA_ "),
and the South Carolina Business Corporation Act of 1988, as amended (the "
_SCBCA_ "), at the Effective Time, the

      
 

 



 

Company shall merge with and into Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving
Corporation in the Merger and shall continue its corporate existence under the
laws of the State of South Carolina. Upon consummation of the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease.

 



 

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective as of the date and
time specified in the Articles of Merger filed with the Secretary of State of
the State of North Carolina (the " _North Carolina Secretary_ ") and the
Articles of Merger filed with the Secretary of State of the State of South
Carolina (the " _South Carolina Secretary_ ") (collectively, the " _Articles
of Merger_ "). The term " _Effective Time_ " shall be the date and time when
the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Articles of Merger.

 



 

1.3 _Closing_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at
10:00 a.m., New York City time, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and
Katz, 51 West 52nd Street, New York, New York, on a date no later than three
(3) Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law)
of the latest to occur of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied or waived at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions and
the continued satisfaction or waiver of all other conditions set forth in
_Article VII_), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by
the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in
this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

 



 

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_. At
the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Parent in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended
in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

1.5 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that
this Agreement shall constitute, and is hereby adopted as, a plan of
reorganization for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. From and
after the date of this Agreement and until the Closing Date, each party shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

 



 

1.6 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall
have the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the relevant provisions of
the NCBCA and the SCBCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company shall vest in the Surviving Corporation,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company shall become the debts,
liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

1.7 _Parent Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of
the following securities, each share of the common stock, par value $2.50 per
share, of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, and shall not be affected
by the Merger.

 



      
 

 



 

1.8 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the
holder of any of the following securities:

 



 

(a) Each share of the common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company
(" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including each share of Company Common Stock that was formerly
a Company Restricted Stock Award), except for any Cancelled Shares, shall be
converted into the right to receive 0.14 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "),
without interest and subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section
1.8(c)_, of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon the Effective Time,
pursuant to _Section 1.7_, the Parent Common Stock, including the shares
issued to former holders of Company Common Stock as Merger Consideration,
shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) All shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time that are owned directly by Parent or the Company
(in each case, other than shares of Company Common Stock (i) held in trust
accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a
fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties and
(ii) held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company in respect of a
debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and
no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor (such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ "). " _Company
Equity Award_ " means a Company Option and/or a Company Restricted Stock
Award.

 



 

(c) If, prior to the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Parent Common
Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been increased, decreased or changed
into or exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities, in
any such case as a result of a reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, or other
similar change in capitalization, or there shall be any extraordinary dividend
or distribution paid, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be
made to the Merger Consideration to give holders of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event;
_provided_ , that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit Parent
or the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 



 

1.9 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options. _At the Effective Time, each option granted by the
Company to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ")
that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, in consideration for the right to
receive, as promptly as practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) calendar
days) following the Effective Time, a cash payment (without interest and less
applicable withholding Taxes) with respect thereto equal to the product of (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the
Cash Consideration (as defined below) over the exercise price per share of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of

 



      
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, any
Company Option with an exercise price equal to or in excess of the Cash
Consideration shall be cancelled by virtue of the Merger without any action on
the part of the holder thereof and without any payment to the holder thereof.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Cash Consideration_ " shall mean
the product determined by multiplying (x) the Exchange Ratio by (y) the Parent
Share Value.

 



 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards. _At the Effective Time, each award in
respect of a share of Company Common Stock subject to vesting, repurchase or
other lapse restriction granted under a Company Equity Plan (each, a "
_Company Restricted Stock Award_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall vest in full and the restrictions thereon shall
lapse, and, as of the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock that
was formerly a Company Restricted Stock Award shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration (without interest and less applicable withholding Taxes)
as promptly as practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) calendar days)
following the Effective Time. For purposes of clarity, any accrued but unpaid
dividends with respect to any Company Restricted Stock Award shall be paid at
the same time as the Merger Consideration is paid with respect to such former
Company Restricted Stock Awards, as described in the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(c) _Corporate Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the board of directors
of the Company or the appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions
providing for the treatment of the Company Options and Company Restricted
Stock Awards contemplated by this _Section 1.9_.

 



 

(d) _Parent Actions_. Parent may elect to process through its payroll (rather
than the procedures contemplated by _Article II_) any payments of cash or
Merger Consideration contemplated by this Section 1.9 to holders of Company
Equity Awards.

 



 

1.10 _Bank Merger_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Park Sterling
Bank, a North Carolina-chartered commercial bank and a direct, wholly owned
Subsidiary of the Company (" _Park Sterling Bank_ "), will merge (the " _Bank
Merger_ ") with and into South State Bank, a South Carolina banking
corporation and a direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Parent Bank_
"). Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and,
following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Park Sterling
Bank shall cease. The parties agree that, subject to the receipt of Regulatory
Approvals, the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the
Effective Time. The Bank Merger shall be implemented pursuant to an agreement
and plan of merger, in a form to be specified by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "). In order to
obtain the necessary Regulatory Approvals for the Bank Merger, the parties
shall cause the following to be accomplished as promptly as practicable: (x)
the Company shall cause Park Sterling Bank to approve the Bank Merger
Agreement; the Company, as the sole shareholder of Park Sterling Bank, shall
approve the Bank Merger Agreement; and the Company shall cause Park Sterling
Bank to duly execute and deliver to Parent the Bank Merger Agreement; and (y)
Parent shall cause Parent Bank to approve the Bank Merger Agreement; Parent,
as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, shall approve the Bank Merger
Agreement; and Parent shall cause Parent Bank to duly execute and deliver to
the Company the Bank Merger Agreement. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall cause Park Sterling Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to

 



     

 



 

execute such articles of merger and any other documents and certificates as
are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Certificates_
") immediately after the Effective Time.

 



 

 **ARTICLE II 
DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION**

 



 

2.1 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective Time,
Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with a bank or trust
company mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_
"), pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing (the "
_Exchange Agent Agreement_ "), for the benefit of the holders of record of
shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, for exchange in accordance with this _Article II_, (a) the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to deliver the aggregate
Merger Consideration and (b) any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to _Section 2.2(f)_ (such shares of Parent Common Stock and cash
described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto (after giving effect to _Section 6.14_),
the " _Exchange Fund_ "), and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to
timely deliver the Merger Consideration.

 



 

2.2 _Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 



 

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall
direct the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each, a " _Holder_ ," and collectively, " _Holders_ ")
of certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") and uncertificated shares of Common Company Stock represented
by book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") that have been converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.8_ and
(subject to _Section 1.9(d)_) _Section 1.9_, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) shall pass only upon delivery
of Certificate(s) (or affidavits of loss in lieu of such Certificate(s)) or
transfer of such Book-Entry Share(s) to the Exchange Agent and shall be
substantially in such form and have such other provisions as shall be
determined by the Exchange Agent and Parent and reasonably acceptable to the
Company) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s) in exchange for the Merger
Consideration and any cash in lieu of a fractional share and any dividends or
distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.

 



 

(b) Upon proper surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate(s) or
transfer of its Book-Entry Share(s), accompanied by a properly completed
Letter of Transmittal, a Holder of Company Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive, promptly after the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration in
respect of the shares of Company Common Stock represented by its
Certificate(s) or Book-Entry Share(s), as applicable. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall represent after the Effective
Time, for all purposes, only the right to receive, without interest, the
applicable Merger Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_, together with any cash in
lieu of a fractional share and any dividends or distributions to which such
Holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be paid to the Holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
untransferred Book-Entry Share until the Holder thereof shall surrender such
Certificate or transfer such Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article
II_. Subject to the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws, following surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of such
Book-Entry Share in accordance with this _Article II_, the Holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive, without interest, the amount of any dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time that
theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock to which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share have been converted into the right to receive
and not paid.

 



 

(d) If the Merger Consideration is to be delivered in exchange for a
Certificate representing Company Common Stock to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered in the stock
transfer records of the Company, it shall be a condition to such exchange that
(i) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be
in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment or
issuance shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the payment or issuance to a Person other than the registered Holder of the
Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that the Tax
has been paid or is not applicable. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
first anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any portion of the Merger Consideration such amounts as the
Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, is required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law,
with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that the amounts are
so withheld by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Holder of shares of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such
deduction and withholding was made by the Exchange Agent or Parent, as the
case may be.

 



 

(e) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of any shares of Company Common Stock that were
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares or Book-Entry Shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged for the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of a fractional share and
any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_, in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
_Article II_.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
shall be issued upon the surrender of Certificates or transfer of Book-Entry
Shares for exchange, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common
Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any
such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each Holder of Company Common Stock
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in
cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying (i) the
Parent Share Value by (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account
all shares of Company Common Stock held by such Holder at the Effective Time
and rounded to the nearest one ten-thousandth when expressed in decimal form)
of Parent Common Stock to

 



      
 

 



 

which such Holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section
1.8_. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu
of issuing fractional shares was not separately bargained-for consideration,
but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the
expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares.

 



 

(g) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the Holders of
Company Common Stock as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time shall
be returned to the Surviving Corporation. Any former Holders of Company Common
Stock who have not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation with respect to the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares and any unpaid dividends
and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each
former share of Company Common Stock such Holder holds as determined pursuant
to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed as of a date which is immediately prior to
such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any
Governmental Entity shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become
the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
shares of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws.

 



 

(h) In the event that any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required
by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
amount as Parent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends or distributions to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.2(c)_ deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) Subject to the terms of this Agreement and the Exchange Agent Agreement,
Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to
make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement,
governing (i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any
Holder of Company Common Stock with the procedures and instructions set forth
herein and therein, (ii) the issuance and delivery of the whole number of
shares of the Parent Common Stock portion of the Merger Consideration, into
which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii) the
method of payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III** 
**REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY**

 



 

Except as (a) disclosed in writing in the correspondingly enumerated section
or subsection of the disclosure schedule of the Company delivered herewith
(the " _Company_

 



      
 

 



 

 _Disclosure Schedules_ ") ( _provided_ , that each exception set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedules shall be deemed to qualify any other
representation and warranty to the extent that the relevance of such exception
to such other representation and warranty is reasonably apparent on the face
of the disclosure (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross-reference))
or (b) disclosed in any Company SEC Documents publicly filed prior to the date
hereof (but excluding any disclosures set forth in any "risk factors,"
"forward-looking statements" or "market risk" sections or any other statements
that are similarly non-specific or cautionary, predictive or forward-looking
in nature), the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows:

 



 

3.1 _Corporate Organization_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of North Carolina and is a bank holding
company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended
(" _BHC Act_ ") that has not elected to be treated as a financial holding
company under the BHC Act. Each of the Subsidiaries of the Company is an
entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing (with respect to
jurisdictions that recognize such concept) under the Laws of the jurisdiction
of its organization. The deposit accounts of Park Sterling Bank are insured by
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the " _FDIC_ ") through the Deposit
Insurance Fund to the fullest extent permitted by Law, all premiums and
assessments required to be paid in connection therewith have been paid when
due and no proceedings for the termination of such insurance are pending or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Park Sterling Bank is a member in
good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and owns the requisite
amount of stock therein. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has the
requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease and operate all of its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably
be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Company. True and complete copies of the Articles of
Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company Articles of
Incorporation_ "), and the Bylaws of the Company, as amended (the " _Company
Bylaws_ "), and the articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws (or
comparable organizational documents) of each Company Subsidiary, in each case
as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have previously been furnished
or made available to Parent. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is in violation of any of the provisions of the Company Articles of
Incorporation or the Company Bylaws or such articles or certificate of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of such
Company Subsidiary, as applicable.

 



 

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a
complete and correct list of all the Subsidiaries of the Company (each a "
_Company Subsidiary_ " and collectively the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ").
_Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules also sets forth a list
identifying the owner and percentage ownership interest of all outstanding
capital stock or other equity securities of each such Subsidiary, options,
warrants, stock appreciation rights, scrip, rights to subscribe to, calls or
commitments of any character

 



      
 

 



 

whatsoever relating to, or securities or rights convertible into, shares of
any capital stock or other equity securities of such Subsidiary, or Contracts
by which such Subsidiary may become bound to issue additional shares of its
capital stock or other equity securities, or options, warrants, scrip, rights
to subscribe to, calls or commitments for any shares of its capital stock or
other equity securities and the identity of the parties to any such agreements
or arrangements. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
securities evidencing ownership of the Company Subsidiaries are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and such shares or other securities are
owned by the Company or another of its wholly owned Subsidiaries free and
clear of any lien, claim, charge, option, encumbrance, mortgage, pledge or
security interest or other restriction of any kind (" _Lien_ ") with respect
thereto. Except for its interests in the Company Subsidiaries and as set forth
in _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the Company does not
own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest,

that have been adopted or approved.

 



 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan has been established, operated and administered
in all material respects in accordance with its terms and the requirements of
all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. Neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries has taken any action to take corrective action or make a
filing under any voluntary correction program of the IRS, the U.S. Department
of Labor or any other Governmental Entity with respect to any Company Benefit
Plan within the past three (3) years, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any Knowledge of any material plan defect that would qualify
for correction under any such program.

applicable Law or regulation or by any plan document or other contractual
undertaking, and all premiums due or payable with respect to insurance
policies funding any Company Benefit Plan, for any period through the date
hereof, have been timely made or paid in full or, to the extent not required
to be made or paid on or before the date hereof, have been fully reflected on
the books and records of the Company.

 



 

(e) Each Company Benefit Plan that is in any part a "nonqualified deferred
compensation plan" subject to Section 409A of the Code (A) complies and, at
all times after December 31, 2008 has complied, both in form and operation,
with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the final regulations
and other applicable guidance thereunder and (B) between January 1, 2005 and

of the Treasury and the IRS, except where such noncompliance would not, either
individually or in the aggregate, be likely to result in a material liability
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(f) _Section 3.11(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules identifies each
Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code (the " _Qualified Plans_ "). The IRS has issued a favorable
determination letter or opinion letter with respect to each Qualified Plan and
the related trust has not been revoked, and, to the Knowledge of the Company,
(i) there are no existing circumstances, and (ii) no events have occurred that
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any
Qualified Plan or the related trust. No trust funding any Company Benefit Plan
is intended to meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 



 

(g) No Company Benefit Plan is subject to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, nor does the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates have, or would reasonably be expected to
incur, any liability (i) with respect to Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA or
Section 412, 430 or 4971 of the Code, or (ii) due to failure to comply with
the continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA and
Section 4980B of the Code, which liability or liabilities, individually or in
the aggregate, would be likely to result in a material liability to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(h) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a " _Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a plan that has
two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common
control, within the meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA (a " _Multiple Employer
Plan_ "); (ii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the last six (6) years,
contributed to or been obligated to contribute to any Multiemployer Plan or
Multiple Employer Plan; and (iii) neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries
have, or would reasonably be expected to incur, any liability (including
contingent liability as a result of their relationship to an ERISA Affiliate)
to a Multiemployer Plan as a result of a complete or partial withdrawal from
such Multiemployer Plan, as those terms are defined in Part I of Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA.

 



 

(i) Except as set forth in _Section 3.11(i)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries sponsors, has
sponsored or has any obligation with respect to any employee benefit plan that
provides for any post-employment or post-retirement health or medical or life
insurance benefits for retired, former or current employees or beneficiaries
or dependents thereof, except as required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 



 

(j) Except as set forth on _Section 3.11(j)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules or as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the Transactions will
(either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the
vesting, exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of,
any payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or
other service provider of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in
any limitation on the right of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any Company
Benefit Plan or related trust.

 



      
 

 



 

(k) Without limiting the generality of _Section 3.11(j)_ and except as set
forth on _Section 3.11(k)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, no amount
paid or payable (whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code. No Company Benefit Plan provides for
the gross-up or reimbursement of Taxes under Section 4999 or 409A of the Code,
or otherwise.

 



 

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has engaged in any
transaction described in Section 4069, 4204 or 4212 of ERISA.

 



 

(m) There are no pending or threatened claims (other than claims for benefits
in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been asserted or
instituted, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no set of circumstances
exists that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the
Company Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to
the Company Benefits Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the
Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any
material liability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S.
Department of Labor, any Multiemployer Plan, any Multiple Employer Plan, any
participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or any other party. No Company Benefit
Plan is under audit or, to the Knowledge of the Company, the subject of an
investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental Entity, nor is any
such audit pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened.

 



 

3.12 _Labor Matters_. There are no agreements with, or pending petitions for
recognition of, a labor union or association as the exclusive bargaining agent
for any of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there
are no representation or certification proceedings or petitions seeking a
representation proceeding presently pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened to be brought or filed with the National Labor Relations
Board or any other comparable foreign, state or local labor relations tribunal
or authority. There are no organizing activities, labor strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns, lockouts, material arbitrations or material grievances
or other material labor disputes, other than routine grievance matters, now
pending or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened against or involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and there have not been any such labor
strikes, work stoppages or other labor troubles with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries at any time within three (3) years of the date of this
Agreement. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or
otherwise bound by, any consent decree with, or citation by, any Governmental
Entity relating to employees or employment practices; and, to the Companys
Knowledge, there is no charge of discrimination in employment or employment
practices for any reason, including age, gender, race, religion or other
legally protected category, which has been asserted against the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries that is now pending before the U.S. Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission or any other Governmental Entity that would reasonably
be expected to result in material liability to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in material
compliance with all applicable Laws in respect of employment, employment
practices, including terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours,
employment discrimination, employee classification, workers compensation,
family and

 



      
 

 



 

medical leave, the Immigration Reform and Control Act and occupational safety
and health requirements. Each individual who renders services to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries who is classified by the Company or such
Subsidiary, as applicable, as having the status of an independent contractor,
consultant or other non-employee status for any purpose (including for
purposes of taxation and tax reporting and under Company Benefit Plans) is
properly so characterized, except where such misclassification would not be
material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

3.13 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

 



 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries and each of their employees hold,
and have at all times since January 1, 2014 held, all licenses, registrations,
franchises, certificates, variances, permits and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and properties and are and
have been in compliance with all, and are not and have not been in violation
of any, applicable Law, except, in each case, where the failure to hold such
license, registration, franchise, certificate, variance, permit or
authorization or such noncompliance or violation would not be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received notice
of, any violations of any of the above, except for such violations that would
not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as would not be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have properly
administered all accounts for which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries serves as a trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative,
guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of
the governing documents and applicable Law. None of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or employee of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of trust with respect to any such
fiduciary account that would be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, and the accountings for each such fiduciary account are true
and correct in all material respects and accurately reflect in all material
respects the assets of such fiduciary account.

 



 

(c) Each of the Company and Park Sterling Bank is "well-capitalized" (as such
term is defined at 12 C.F.R. § 225.2(r) and 12 C.F.R. § 325.103(b)(1),
respectively) and "well managed" (as such term is defined at 12 C.F.R. §
225.2(s) and 12 C.F.R. § 362.17(e), respectively), and the rating of Park
Sterling Bank under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1997 (" _CRA_ ") is no
less than "satisfactory." Neither the Company nor Park Sterling Bank has been
informed that its status as "well-capitalized," "well managed" or, in the case
of Park Sterling Bank, for CRA purposes, "satisfactory," will change within
one (1) year.

or by which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is bound, except as would

individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Each of the Material Contracts is valid and binding on the
Company or its applicable Subsidiary and in full force and effect, without
amendment. With respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, there
exists no (x) default or event of default or (y) event, occurrence, condition
or act, which, with the giving of notice, the lapse of time or the happening
of any other event or condition, would become a default or event of default,
in each case, under any Material Contract, except, as would not, individually

on the Company. True, correct and complete copies of all Material Contracts
have been furnished or made available to Parent.

 



 

3.15 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither the Company nor any of its

its business (any such agreement, memorandum of understanding, letter,
undertaking, order, directive or resolutions, whether or not set forth in the
Company Disclosure Schedules, a " _Company Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing, or have
Knowledge, of any pending or threatened regulatory investigation or that any
Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Agency is considering issuing,

3.16 _Investment Securities_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to
all securities held by it in all material respects (except securities sold
under repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity) free
and clear of any Lien, except to the extent that such securities are pledged
in the ordinary course of business consistent with prudent business practices
to secure obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and except for
such defects in title or Liens that would not be material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Such securities are valued on the books of
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects.

 



 

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries employs investment, securities
risk management and other policies, practices and procedures that the Company

Schedules lists all Derivative Transactions, whether entered into for the
account of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for the account of a
customer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. All Derivative
Transactions: (i) were entered into in the ordinary course of business and in
accordance with prudent banking practice and applicable rules, regulations and
policies of all applicable Governmental Entities and with counterparties
believed to be financially responsible at the time; (ii) are legal, valid and
binding obligations of the Company or its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge

other Laws affecting or relating to the rights of creditors generally). The
Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the Knowledge of the Company, the
counterparties to all such Derivative Transactions have duly performed, in all
material respects, their obligations thereunder to the extent that such
obligations to perform have accrued. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
are no material breaches, violations or defaults or allegations or assertions
of such by any party pursuant to any such Derivative Transactions. The
financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
under or with respect to each such Derivative Transaction has been reflected

or sale transaction, futures transaction, cap transaction, floor transaction

Affiliate of the Company), any property in which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries holds a security interest, is, and has since January 1, 2014,

or other proceedings, claims or actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are
there governmental or third-party environmental investigations or remediation
activities or governmental investigations that seek to impose or that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, of any liability or obligation arising under any
Environmental Law pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation
would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action
or governmental investigation that would impose any liability or obligation
that would be or would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in written third-party environmental reports included
in the relevant Loan Documentation regarding real property securing a Loan

Affiliate of the Company, to the Knowledge of the Company, during or prior to
the period of (i) the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries ownership or
operation of any property, (ii) the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
active participation in the management of any propertys operations or (iii)
the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries holding of a security interest or
other interest in any property, there were no releases or threatened releases
of hazardous materials or other materials regulated under Environmental Laws
in, on, under or affecting any such property that, since January 1, 2014,
would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are not subject to any agreement,
order, judgment or decree by or with any court, Governmental Entity or third
party imposing any material liability or obligation with respect to the
foregoing. There has been no written third-party environmental site assessment
conducted since January 1, 2014 assessing the presence of hazardous materials
located on any property owned or leased by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that is within the possession or control of the Company and its
Affiliates as of the date of this Agreement that has not been delivered to
Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

3.19 _Insurance_. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are insured against
such risks and in such amounts as constitute reasonably adequate coverage
against all risks customarily insured against by banking institutions and
their subsidiaries of comparable size and operations to the Company and its
Subsidiaries. _Section 3.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth a
true and complete list of all insurance policies applicable and available to
the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with respect to its business or that
are otherwise maintained by or for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the
" _Company Policies_ "), and the Company has made available true and complete
copies of all such Company Policies to Parent. Except as set forth in _Section
3.19_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules, there is no material claim for
coverage by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending under any of such
policy as to which coverage has been questioned, denied or disputed by the
underwriters of such policies or in respect of which such underwriters have
reserved their rights. Each Company Policy is in full force and effect and all
premiums payable by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have been timely
paid, by the Company or its Subsidiaries, as applicable. Neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice of any threatened
termination of, material premium increase with respect to, or material
alteration of coverage under, any of such policies.

subleases, licenses or other use agreements between the Company or any of its
Affiliates, as landlord, sublandlord or licensor, and third parties with

modifications and supplements thereto, and all such Real Property Leases and
Tenant Leases have been made available to Parent on or prior to the date
hereof.

 



 

(b) Except as would not be material to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries (i) has good and marketable title to all

of way, and other similar encumbrances that do not materially affect the value
or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or affected thereby or
otherwise materially impair business operations at such properties and (D)
such imperfections or irregularities of title or Liens as do not materially
affect the value or use of the properties or assets subject thereto or
affected thereby or otherwise materially impair business operations at such

assurance (i) regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the
preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of Parent and its Subsidiaries are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the board
of directors of Parent and (iii) regarding prevention or timely detection of
the unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of Parents and its
Subsidiaries assets that could have a material effect on Parents financial
statements.

 



 

(c) Parents "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) are designed to ensure that all
information (both financial and non-financial) required to be disclosed by
Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such information is
accumulated and communicated to Parents management as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the principal executive officer and principal

 



      
 

 



 

financial officer of Parent required under the Exchange Act with respect to
such reports. Parent has disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of
such disclosure controls and procedures prior to the date of this Agreement,
to Parents auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of
Parent (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that could
adversely affect in any material respect Parents ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant
role in Parents internal controls over financial reporting.

Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to the Parent SEC
Documents, and the statements contained in such certifications are true and
accurate in all material respects. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries

in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.
Parent is otherwise in compliance with all applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, except for any non-compliance that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent.

 



 

(e) The books and records kept by Parent and its Subsidiaries are in all
material respects complete and accurate and have been maintained in the
ordinary course of business and in accordance with applicable Laws and
accounting requirements. The Parent Financial Statements have been prepared
from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of Parent and its
Subsidiaries.

commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance-sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand, or any "off-balance-sheet arrangement"), where the result,
purpose or intended effect of such contract or arrangement is to avoid
disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material liabilities of,
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in Parents or such Subsidiarys financial
statements.

 



 

4.7 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The audited consolidated balance sheet of
Parent dated as of the Balance Sheet Date is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Parent Balance Sheet_." Except as set forth on _Section 4.7_ of the Parent
Disclosure Schedules or as would not reasonably be expected to have, either

whether absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise, known or unknown, and
whether due or to become due, whether or not the same would have been required
to be reflected in the Parent Balance Sheet if it had existed on the Balance
Sheet Date, except for (i) those liabilities that are reflected or reserved
against on the Parent Balance Sheet (including in the notes thereto), (ii)
liabilities and

 



      
 

 



 

obligations incurred since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice or (iii) liabilities incurred in
connection with the Transactions.

of Parent, threatened, legal, administrative, arbitral or other proceedings,

to, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

 



 

(b) There is no material injunction, order, judgment, decree or regulatory
restriction (other than regulatory restrictions of general application that
apply to similarly situated companies) imposed upon Parent.

 



 

4.10 _Compliance with Applicable Law_.

 



 

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries and each of their employees hold, and
have at all times since January 1, 2014 held, all licenses, registrations,
franchises, certificates, variances, permits and authorizations necessary for
the lawful conduct of their respective businesses and properties and are and
have been in compliance with all, and are not and have not been in violation
of any, applicable Law, except, in each case, where the failure to hold such
license, registration, franchise, certificate, variance, permit or
authorization or such noncompliance or violation would not be reasonably
likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, and neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has Knowledge of, or has received notice of, any
violations of any of the above, except for such violations that would not be
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(b) Except as would not be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, Parent and each of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all
accounts for which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries acts as a fiduciary,
including accounts for which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries serves as a
trustee, agent, custodian, personal representative, guardian, conservator or
investment adviser, in accordance with the terms of the governing documents
and applicable Law. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
director, officer or employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has
committed any breach of trust with respect to any such fiduciary account that
would be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the
accountings for each such fiduciary account are true and correct in all
material respects and accurately reflect in all material respects the assets
of such fiduciary account.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and Parent Bank is "well-capitalized" (as such term is
defined at 12 C.F.R. § 225.2(r) and 12 C.F.R. § 325.103(b)(1), respectively)
and "well managed" (as such term is defined at 12 C.F.R. § 225.2(s) and 12
C.F.R. § 362.17(e), respectively), and the

 



      
 

 



 

rating of Parent Bank under the CRA is no less than "satisfactory." Neither
Parent nor Parent Bank has been informed that its status as "well-
capitalized," "well managed" or, in the case of Parent Bank, for CRA purposes,
"satisfactory," will change within one (1) year.

 



 

4.11 _Tax Matters_. Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken or
agreed to take any action or is aware of any fact or circumstance that would
prevent or impede, or could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede, the
Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code.

 



 

4.12 _Agreements with Regulatory Agencies_. Neither Parent nor any of its

similar undertaking to, or is subject to any order or directive by, or has
been ordered to pay any civil penalty by, or is a recipient of any supervisory
letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request or suggestion
of any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity that restricts the

to pay dividends, its credit or risk management policies, its management or
its business (any such agreement, memorandum of understanding, letter,
undertaking, order, directive or resolutions, whether or not set forth in the
Parent Disclosure Schedules, a " _Parent Regulatory Agreement_ "), nor has
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries been advised in writing, or have Knowledge
of any pending or threatened regulatory investigation or that any Regulatory
Agency or other Governmental Agency is considering issuing, initiating,
ordering or requesting any Parent Regulatory Agreement.

(a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries, and, to the Knowledge of Parent

or other proceedings, claims or actions pending, or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, nor are there
governmental or third-party environmental investigations or remediation
activities or governmental investigations that seek to impose or that could
reasonably be expected to result in the imposition, on Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, of any liability or obligation arising under any Environmental
Law pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries, which liability or obligation would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. To the Knowledge of Parent, there is no
reasonable basis for any such proceeding, claim, action or governmental
investigation that would impose any liability or obligation that would be or
would reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material
to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Except as set forth in written third-party environmental reports included

property, (ii) Parents or any of its Subsidiaries active participation in
the management of any property or (iii) Parents or any of its Subsidiaries
holding of a security interest or other interest in any property, there were

regulated under Environmental Laws in, on, under or affecting any such
property since January 1, 2014 that would reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries are not subject to any agreement,
order, judgment or decree by or with any court, Governmental Entity or third
party imposing any material liability or obligation with respect to the
foregoing. There has been no written third-party environmental site assessment
conducted since January 1, 2014 assessing the presence of hazardous materials

that is within the possession or control of Parent and its Affiliates as of
the date of this Agreement that has not been delivered to the Company prior to
the date of this Agreement.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed or otherwise
possess rights to use free and clear of all Liens all material Intellectual
Property used or held for use by Parent and any of its Subsidiaries as of the
date hereof (collectively, the " _Parent Intellectual Property_ ") in the
manner that it is currently used by Parent and any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Since January 1, 2014, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received written notice from any third party alleging any material
interference, infringement, misappropriation or violation of any Intellectual

Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has infringed upon, misappropriated or
violated any Intellectual Property rights of any third party. To the Knowledge

Schedules, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
material agreement in which either Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is
obligated to indemnify any Person against a claim of infringement or
misappropriation of any Intellectual Property.

 



 

4.15 _Loans_. _Section 4.15_ of the Parent Disclosure Schedules identifies
each Loan payable to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that (i) as of March
31, 2017, (A) was on non-accrual

 



      
 

 



 

status, (B) a specific reserve allocation existed in connection therewith, (C)

or finders fees in connection with the Merger or the other Transactions,
except for Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc.

 



 

4.17 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. The adoption by the board of directors of
Parent of this Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions represent all
the action necessary by Parent to render inapplicable to this Agreement, the

similar provision of the Parent Articles of Incorporation or Parent Bylaws is
applicable to this Agreement and the Transactions.

 



 

4.18 _Approvals_. As of the date of this Agreement, to the Knowledge of
Parent, there is no reason why all necessary regulatory approvals and consents
from any Governmental Entity should not be received in order to permit the
consummation of the Transactions, including the Merger and the Bank Merger, on
a timely basis.

 



 

4.19 _Parent Opinion_. Prior to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has

taken, and assist and cooperate with the other party in taking, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
with respect to the Transactions, including obtaining any third-party consent

orders, clearances, waivers or approvals of all third parties and Regulatory
Agencies or other Governmental Entities that are necessary or advisable to
consummate the Transactions, including the Regulatory Approvals.

 



 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything set
forth in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall Parent be required, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be permitted (without Parents
prior written consent in its sole discretion), to take any action, or commit
to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, involving
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries pursuant to this

Subsidiaries taken as a whole (any of the foregoing, a " _Materially
Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "); _provided_ , that _,_ if requested by
Parent, then the Company and its Subsidiaries will take or commit to take any
such action, or agree to any such condition or restriction, so long as such

Company and its Subsidiaries only in the event the Closing occurs.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of information, Parent
and the Company shall, upon request, furnish each other with all information

conditioned or delayed), except as may be required by applicable Law or except
as expressly permitted under (and subject to compliance with) _Section 6.9_
in connection with a Change in Company Recommendation or Change in Parent
Recommendation, as the case may be.

 



 

6.5 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) From the Closing Date through the first anniversary thereof (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause to be provided
employee benefits (excluding severance benefits) for the employees (as a
group) who are actively employed by the Company and its Subsidiaries on the
Closing Date and continue to be actively employed after the Effective Time ("
_Covered Employees_ ") that, in the aggregate, are at least substantially
comparable to the employee benefits (excluding severance benefits) that are
generally made available to similarly situated employees of Parent or its
Subsidiaries; _provided_ , that until such time as Parent shall cause Covered
Employees to participate in the employee benefit plans that are made available
to similarly situated employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Company and its Subsidiaries), a Covered Employees continued participation in
the employee benefit plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall be deemed
to satisfy the foregoing provisions of this sentence (it being understood that
participation in any different Parent plans may commence at different times).

 



 

(b) Parent shall assume and honor the obligations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries under all employment, severance, consulting, retirement and other
compensation Contracts in accordance with their terms, except to the extent
such Contract is superseded or modified by an agreement with Parent,
_provided_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Parent from amending,
suspending or terminating any such Contract to the extent permitted by its
terms and applicable Law. Parent hereby acknowledges that the Merger will
constitute a "Change in Control" (or concept of similar import) in accordance
with the provisions of such Company Benefit Plans.

 



 

(c) The Company may pay annual incentive compensation in accordance with
_Section 6.5(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

(d) To the extent that a Covered Employee becomes eligible to participate in a
Parent Benefit Plan, Parent shall cause such Parent Benefit Plan to recognize
the service of such Covered Employee with the Company or its Subsidiaries for
purposes of eligibility, participation

 



      
 

 



 

and vesting under such Parent Benefit Plan, to the same extent that such
service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a
corresponding Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible
to participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that such
recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, (ii) apply for
any purpose under any retiree medical plan or defined benefit pension plan or
(iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which
similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive
credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with
respect to level of benefits or participation. For purposes of clarity,
Covered Employees shall be credited with service performed for either a
predecessor to the Company or any Subsidiary or an entity previously acquired
by the Company or any Subsidiary to the same extent that such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a corresponding
Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time. With respect to any
health care plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Company
and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is eligible to participate
for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is first eligible to
participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (x) cause any
preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
Parent or Subsidiary plan to be waived with respect to such Covered Employee
to the extent that such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under
the Company Benefit Plan in which such Covered Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) recognize any health care
expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in the year that includes the
Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Covered Employee is first
eligible to participate) for purposes of any applicable deductible and annual
out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such health, dental or vision
plan of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. To the extent Parent does not or
cannot take the actions described in clauses (x) and (y) of the immediately
preceding sentence, it shall not require any Covered Employee to commence
participation in the corresponding Parent Benefit Plan until the beginning of
the first plan year following the Effective Time and such Covered Employee
shall be entitled to remain on the applicable Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(e) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the board of directors of the
Company (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate the Companys 401(k)
plan (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_"), effective as of the day prior to the
Closing Date. The form and substance of such resolutions and any other actions
taken in connection with the foregoing termination shall be subject to the
review and approval of Parent. Following the Effective Time the assets thereof
shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent shall permit the Covered
Employees to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash,
in an amount equal to the full account balance (including loans) distributed
to such Covered Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan to the Parents 401(k)
plan.

 



 

(f) From and after the date hereof, any written or oral communications to the
employees, officers or directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters after the Closing, shall be in
the form of mutually agreeable communications, prepared in prior consultation
with Parent, it being agreed that Parent and the

 



      
 

 



 

Company shall cooperate, including by providing Parent a reasonable period of
time to review any such communication, in providing mutually agreeable
communications.

 



 

(g) The parties agree to the severance-related and other matters described in
_Section 6.5(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

(h) Without limiting the generality of this _Section 6.5_ or _Section 9.12_,
the provisions of this _Section 6.5_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (i)
establish, amend or modify any Company Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or any other benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates; (ii) alter or limit the ability of Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and
its Subsidiaries) to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit Plan,
employment agreement or any other benefit or employment plan, program,
agreement or arrangement after the Closing Date; or (iii) confer upon any
current or former employee, officer, director or independent contractor any
right to employment or continued employment or continued service with Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries (including, following the Closing Date, the Company
and its Subsidiaries), or constitute or create an employment agreement with
any employee.

 



 

6.6 _Additional Agreements_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the Company
and Parent agree to cooperate fully with each other and to use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, at the time and in the manner contemplated by this Agreement, the
Merger and the other Transactions. In case at any time after the Effective
Time any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of
this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the
one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other) or to vest the
Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights,
approvals, immunities and franchises of either party to the Merger, the proper
officers and directors of each party and their respective Subsidiaries shall,
at Parents sole expense, take all such necessary action as may be reasonably
requested by Parent.

 



 

(b) Parent may at any time change the method of effecting the Merger and the
Bank Merger (including by providing for the merger of the Company with a
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent), and the Company agrees to enter into such
amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request in order to give
effect to such restructuring; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such change or
amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount, kind or timing (in a manner
that materially delays) of the receipt of the Merger Consideration provided
for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger
with respect to the Companys shareholders or (iii) be reasonably likely to
cause the Closing to be prevented or materially delayed or the receipt of the
Regulatory Approvals to be prevented or materially delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

6.7 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any
time before the date of this Agreement, or who becomes before the Effective
Time, a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a
" _Company Indemnified Party_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding, investigation or other legal proceeding, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a " _Claim_ "), in
which a Company Indemnified Party is, or is threatened to be made, a party or
witness or arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or
officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries if such Claim pertains to
any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective
Time (including the Merger and the other Transactions), regardless of whether
such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The Surviving Corporation shall
pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees) in advance of
the final disposition of any such proceeding to each Company Indemnified Party
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable state or federal Law upon
receipt of an undertaking (in a reasonable and customary form) to repay such
advance payments if he or she shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to
indemnification under this _Section 6.7(a)_.

 



 

(b) Any Company Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
_Section 6.7(a)_, upon learning of any Claim, shall promptly notify the
Surviving Corporation thereof. In the event of any such Claim (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), (i) the Surviving Corporation shall have
the right to assume the defense thereof and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to such Company Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Company
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Company Indemnified Parties advises that there are substantive issues which
raise conflicts of interest between the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Indemnified Parties, the Company Indemnified Parties may retain counsel
satisfactory to them, and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable
fees and expenses of such counsel for the Company Indemnified Parties promptly
as statements therefor are received; _provided_ , that the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section 6.7(b)_ to pay for
only one firm of counsel for all Company Indemnified Parties (to the extent
the claims of such Company Indemnified Parties arise out of substantially
similar transactions) in any jurisdiction; (ii) the Company Indemnified
Parties and the Surviving Corporation will cooperate in the defense of any
such Claim; and (iii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not have any obligation hereunder to any Company Indemnified Party when
and if a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine, and such
determination shall have become final, that the indemnification of such
Company Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable Law.

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable best efforts (and the
Company shall cooperate prior to the Effective Time in these efforts) to
maintain in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time the
currently existing directors and officers liability insurance policy
maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation

 



     

 



 

may substitute therefor (i) policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions which are substantially no less advantageous
to the Company Indemnified Parties, including with respect to the same
retrospective date, limits of liability and coverage parts, or (ii) with the
consent of the Company given prior to the Effective Time, any other policy)
with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts, errors or omissions
which occurred prior to the Effective Time and covering persons who are
currently covered by such insurance; _provided_ , that in no event shall the
Surviving Corporation be required to expend annually in the aggregate an
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium payment on the Companys
current policy in effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum
Amount_ ") and, if the Surviving Corporation is unable to maintain such policy
(or substitute policy) as a result of this proviso, the Surviving Corporation
shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for a period of six
(6) years following the Effective Time by payment of such amount; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation may substitute
therefor a six (6)-year "tail" prepaid policy the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to the Company Indemnified Parties than the Companys existing policies as of
the date hereof; _provided_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to pay, in the aggregate, an amount greater than the Maximum
Amount for such "tail" policy and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the
aggregate amount necessary to procure or maintain such "tail" policy exceeds
the Maximum Amount, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as is available by payment of such amount or (ii) Parent
may request that the Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage
for a six (6)-year period under the Companys existing insurance programs (to
be effective as of the Effective Time).

 



 

(d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.7_.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her
respective heirs and representatives.

 



 

6.8 _Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to list,
prior to the Effective Time, on the NASDAQ, subject to official notice of
issuance, the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the
Merger, and Parent shall give all notices and make all filings with the NASDAQ
required in connection with the Transactions.

 



 

6.9 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall not, shall cause its Subsidiaries and its and their
respective officers, directors and employees not to, and shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and their respective agents, investment bankers,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants and other retained representatives
(each, together with such officers, directors and employees, a "
_Representative_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or the making of any
proposal or offer with respect to, or a

 



      
 

 



 

transaction to effect, a merger, reorganization, share exchange,
consolidation, sale of assets, sale of shares of capital stock (including by
way of tender offer), business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that, if consummated, would constitute an Alternative Transaction
(any of the foregoing inquiries, proposals or offers being referred to herein
as an " _Acquisition Proposal_ "), (ii) participate in any discussions with or
provide any confidential information or data to any Person (or Representative
of such Person) relating to an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction, or engage in any negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal
or Alternative Transaction, or knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to
make or implement an Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, (iii)
approve or execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
merger agreement, asset purchase or share exchange agreement, option agreement
or other Contract related to any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (iv) propose or agree to do
any of the foregoing. The Company shall be responsible for any violation of
this _Section 6.9_ by its Representatives.

 



 

(b) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction_ " means any of (i)
a transaction pursuant to which any Person (or group of Persons) other than
Parent or its Affiliates, directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire
more than twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or outstanding voting power of the Company, whether from the Company or
pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer or otherwise, (ii) a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation or other business combination
involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries whose assets, individually
or in the aggregate, constitute twenty percent (20%) or more of the fair
market value of the consolidated assets of the Company (except, in each case,
the Merger and the Bank Merger), (iii) any transaction pursuant to which any
Person (or group of Persons) other than Parent or its Affiliates acquires or
would acquire control of assets (including for this purpose the outstanding
equity securities of any Company Subsidiaries and securities of the entity
surviving any merger or business combination involving any Company Subsidiary)
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than twenty
percent (20%) of the fair market value of all the assets, deposits, net
revenues or net income of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
immediately prior to such transaction or (iv) any other consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization or similar transaction involving the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the Transactions, as a result
of which the holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
such transaction do not, in the aggregate, own at least eighty percent (80%)
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and the outstanding voting
power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction immediately
after the consummation thereof in substantially the same proportion as such
holders held the shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
consummation thereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its Representatives may,
prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, and subject to
compliance with the other terms of this _Section 6.9_ and to first entering
into a confidentiality agreement having provisions that are no less favorable
to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, engage
in discussions and negotiations with, or provide any nonpublic information or
data to, any Person in response to an unsolicited _bona fide_ written
Acquisition Proposal by such Person first made after the date of this
Agreement (that did not result from a breach of this _Section 6.9_) and which
the board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after
consultation with

 



      
 

 



 

its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) constitutes or is reasonably
likely to result in a Superior Proposal, if and only to the extent that the
board of directors of the Company concludes in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably
likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. The
Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any nonpublic information or data
provided to any Person pursuant to the prior sentence prior to or
simultaneously with furnishing such information to such Person (to the extent
not previously provided).

 



 

(d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any
request for nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries by any Person that informs the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that it is considering making, or has made, an Acquisition Proposal, or any
inquiry from any Person seeking to have discussions or negotiations with the
Company that is reasonably likely to lead to a possible Acquisition Proposal
or Alternative Transaction. Such notice shall be made orally and confirmed in
writing, and shall indicate the identity of the Person making the Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request and the material terms and conditions of any
inquiries, proposals or offers (including a copy thereof if in writing and any
related documentation or correspondence). The Company shall also promptly, and
in any event within twenty-four (24) hours, notify Parent, orally and in
writing, if it enters into discussions or negotiations concerning any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction or provides nonpublic
information or data to any Person in accordance with _Section 6.9(c)_ and
keep Parent reasonably informed of the status and terms of any such proposals,
offers, inquiries, discussions or negotiations on a current basis, including
by providing a copy of all material documentation or correspondence relating
thereto.

 



 

(e) Except as provided in _Section 6.9(f)_, none of the Company, the board of
directors of the Company, or any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent or propose publicly to
withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Board Recommendation or approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company, the board of directors of the Company or any such
committee thereof with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii)
approve or recommend to its shareholders, or resolve to or publicly propose or
announce its intention to approve or recommend to its shareholders, an
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) fail to publicly, finally and without
qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within ten (10) Business Days
after such Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by Parent to do
so (which request may be made once per Acquisition Proposal (and any material
change thereto)) (any of the foregoing, a " _Change in Company Recommendation_
").

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, the board of directors of
the Company may make a Change in Company Recommendation if and only if (i) an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (that did not result from
a breach of this _Section 6.9_) is made to the Company by a third party, and
such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (ii) the board of directors of the
Company has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (iii) the board of directors of the Company has concluded
in good faith (after consultation with

 



      
 

 



 

its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (iv) prior to
effecting the Change in Company Recommendation, five (5) Business Days shall
have elapsed since the Company has given written notice to Parent advising
Parent that the Company intends to take such action and specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of,
and the identity of the person making, any such Acquisition Proposal that is
the basis of the proposed action (a " _Company Notice of Recommendation
Change_ ") (it being understood that any amendment to any material term of
such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Recommendation
Change, except that, in such case, the five (5) Business Day period referred
to in this clause (iv) and in clauses (v) and (vi) shall be reduced to three
(3) Business Days following the giving of such new Company Notice of
Recommendation Change), (v) during such five (5) Business Day period, the
Company has considered, and engaged in good-faith discussions with Parent
regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent and (vi) the board of directors of the Company, following
such five (5) Business Day period, again reasonably determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel, and taking into account
any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by
Parent) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a
Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Change in Company Recommendation
would be reasonably likely to violate the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means
an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made by a third
Person (or group of Persons acting in concert within the meaning of Rule 13d-5
under the Exchange Act) to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a
tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation or other business
combination or acquisition transaction, (A) all or substantially all of the
assets of the Company or (B) all of the outstanding voting securities of the
Company and which the board of directors of the Company has in good faith
determined (taking into account, among other things, (1) its consultation with
its outside legal counsel and its financial advisors and (2) the terms and
conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this Agreement (as it may be
proposed to be amended by Parent)), to be more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the Companys shareholders than the Transactions (as it may
be proposed to be amended by Parent) and to be reasonably capable of being
consummated on the terms proposed, taking into account all other legal,
financial, timing, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
and the Person making the proposal.

 



 

(g) Except as provided in _Section 6.9(h)_, none of Parent, the board of
directors of Parent, or any committee thereof shall withhold, withdraw or
modify in any manner adverse to the Company, or propose publicly to withhold,
withdraw or modify in any manner adverse to the Company, the Parent Board
Recommendation or approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by
Parent, the board of directors of Parent or any such committee thereof with
respect to this Agreement or the Transactions (a " _Change in Parent
Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(h) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
time the Parent Shareholder Approval is obtained, the board of directors of
Parent may make a Change in Parent Recommendation if and only if (i) the board
of directors of Parent has concluded in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
violate the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (ii) prior to
effecting the Change in Parent Recommendation, five (5) Business Days shall
have elapsed since Parent has given written notice to the Company advising the
Company that Parent

 



      
 

 



 

intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons
therefor (a " _Parent Notice of Recommendation Change_ "), (iii) during such
five (5) Business Day period, Parent has considered and engaged in good-faith
discussions with the Company regarding, any adjustment or modification of the
terms of this Agreement proposed by the Company, and (iv) the board of
directors of Parent, following such five (5) Business Day period, again
reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal
counsel, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms
of this Agreement proposed by the Company) that failure to make a Change in
Parent Recommendation would be reasonably likely to violate the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.9_ shall prohibit the Company or its
Subsidiaries from taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from
making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule
14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and
listen" statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that compliance with such rules shall not in any way limit or
modify the effect that any action taken pursuant to such rules has under any
other provision of this Agreement, including _Section 8.1(f)_; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder, which is followed
within ten (10) Business Days by an unqualified public reaffirmation of the
Company Board Recommendation) shall be deemed for all purposes of this
Agreement to be a Change in Company Recommendation unless the Company Board
expressly publicly reaffirms without qualification the Company Board
Recommendation in connection with such communication.

 



 

(j) The Company agrees that it (i) will and will cause its Subsidiaries, and
its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or Alternative
Transaction or similar transaction and (ii) will not release any third party
from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement
to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction, and will enforce the terms
thereof and, to the extent applicable, request from such third parties the
return or destruction of any confidential information of the Company provided
thereunder.

 



 

(k) The Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any
Acquisition Proposal or Alternative Transaction other than this Agreement and
the Merger prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

 



 

6.10 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
give prompt notice to the other of any fact, change, event or circumstance
known to it that (a) has had or is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, changes, events and circumstances known to it,
to have or to result in any Material Adverse Effect on the Company or Parent,
as applicable, with respect to it or (b) would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or that could be expected
to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition
in _Article VII_; _provided_ , that any failure to give notice in accordance
with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to
constitute a violation of this

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 6.10_ or the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.2_
or _7.3_ to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement
by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying
breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in
_Section 7.2_ or _7.3_ to be satisfied.

 



 

6.11 _Governance Matters_.

 



 

(a) Effective immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint (i)
Mr. James C. Cherry and one other current non-employee member of the board of
directors of the Company mutually agreed upon by the parties (it being
understood that such non-employee member must be approved by the Governance
Committee of the board of directors of Parent) prior to the Effective Time
(each such director, a " _Company Director_ ") to Parents board of directors
and to the board of directors of Parent Bank, in each case, for a term
expiring at the next annual meeting of the shareholders of Parent or Parent
Bank, as applicable, following the Effective Time and (ii) Mr. Cherry to the
Executive Committee of Parents board of directors to serve thereon for a
period of one (1) year from the date of appointment.

 



 

(b) Subject to and in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation,
effective as of the Effective Time, (i) Mr. Robert R. Horger shall continue to
serve as the Chairman of the board of directors of the Surviving Corporation
and (ii) the officers of Parent in office immediately prior to the Effective
Time, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected,
shall serve as the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time in accordance with the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

described in _Section 6.12_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

 



 

6.13 _Exemption from Liability Under Section 16(b)_. The Company and Parent
agree that, in order to most effectively compensate and retain those officers
and directors of the Company subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act (the " _Company Insiders_ "), both prior to and
after the Effective Time, it is desirable that Company Insiders not be subject
to a risk of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in connection with the conversion of shares
of Company Common Stock in the Merger, and for that compensatory and retention
purposes agree to this _Section 6.13_. The boards of directors of Parent and
of the Company, or a committee of non-employee directors thereof (as such term
is defined for purposes of Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange Act), shall
promptly, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, take all such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to cause (i) any dispositions of Company
Common Stock by any Company Insiders and (ii) any acquisitions of Parent
Common Stock by any Company Insiders who, immediately following the Merger,
will be officers or directors of the Surviving Corporation subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, in each case,
pursuant to the Transactions, to be exempt from liability pursuant to Rule
16b-3 under the Exchange Act to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
Law.

 



 

6.14 _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, each of Parent and the
Company shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in
respect of Parent Common Stock and Company Common Stock and the record dates
and payment dates relating thereto, it being

 



      
 

 



 

the intention of the parties that holders of Company Common Stock shall not
receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any quarter with
respect to their shares of Company Common Stock and any shares of Parent
Common Stock any such holder receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 



 

6.15 _Takeover Laws and Provisions_. No party shall take any action that would
cause this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Transactions to be
subject to requirements imposed by any Takeover Statute, and each party shall
take all necessary steps within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued
exemption of) the Merger and the other Transactions, or if necessary challenge
the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Statute, as now or
hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be,
applicable to the Transactions, each of Parent and the Company will grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of any Takeover Statute on
any of the Transactions, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

 



 

6.16 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of
any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or
affiliates relating to the Transactions and shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in at its own expense the defense or settlement of any such
litigation. In addition, no settlement of any shareholder litigation against
the Company shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

6.17 _Company Debt_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees to execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and
delivered, by or on behalf of the Surviving Corporation, at or prior to the
Effective Time, one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees, and other
instruments required for the due assumption of the Companys obligations to
the extent required by the terms of any outstanding debt securities, Trust
Preferred Securities or related guarantees. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company and Parent shall cooperate to prepare any instrument required by the
documentation governing such outstanding debt securities, Trust Preferred
Securities or related guarantees pursuant to which Parent shall assume the
obligations of the Company with respect to outstanding debt securities, Trust
Preferred Securities or related guarantees as of the Closing (" _Supplemental
Instruments_ ") and any related certificates and other documents required by
the documentation governing such outstanding debt securities, Trust Preferred
Securities or related guarantees. On the Closing Date, the Company and Parent,
as and to the extent required by the documentation governing such outstanding
debt securities, Trust Preferred Securities or related guarantees, shall
execute and deliver any such Supplemental Instrument and any related
certificates and other documents.

 



 

(b) If requested by Parent, the Company shall deliver all notices and take all
other actions to facilitate the termination at the Closing of all commitments
in respect of (i) the Senior Term Loan Agreement, dated as of December 18,
2015, by and between the Company and Capital Bank Corporation, as amended,
supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time (the " _Existing Loan
Facility_ ") and (ii) the First Capital Bancorp, Inc. Variable Rate
Subordinated Note, dated as of January 10, 2014, by and between First Capital
Bancorp, Inc. and

 



      
 

 



 

Franklin Federal Savings (the " _First Capital Note_ ") and the repayment in
full on the Closing Date of all obligations in respect of the indebtedness
thereunder; _provided_ , that the Company and Parent shall cooperate to
provide any funds required to effect all such repayments at or prior to the
Closing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if requested
by Parent, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to deliver to Parent
at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date an executed payoff
letter with respect to the Existing Credit Facility and the First Capital Note
(collectively, the " _Payoff Letters_ ") in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, which Payoff Letters shall, among other things,
include the respective payoff amounts.

 



 

6.18 _Restructuring Efforts_. If either the Company or Parent shall have
failed to obtain the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder
Approval, as applicable, at the duly convened Company Shareholders Meeting or
Parent Shareholders Meeting, as applicable, or any adjournment or postponement
thereof, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with _Section
8.1_, each of the parties shall (i) in good faith use its reasonable best
efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transaction provided for herein
and/or (ii) resubmit this Agreement or the Transactions (or as restructured
pursuant to this _Section 6.18_) to its shareholders for adoption and
approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of clause (i) only, no
party shall have any obligation to agree to (A) alter or change any material
term of this Agreement, including the amount, kind or timing (in a manner that
materially delays) of receipt of the Merger Consideration provided for in this
Agreement or (B) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect
to the shareholders of the Company or Parent.

8.3 _Termination Fee_.

 



 

(a) In the event that (i) before the termination of this Agreement, a bona
fide Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made
known to the shareholders, senior management or the board of directors of the
Company, or any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional) to make an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this

date any such Acquisition Agreement is entered into, as applicable, pay Parent
a fee equal to $25,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of
immediately available funds; _provided_ , that, for purposes of this _Section
8.3(a)_, all references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "20%"
shall instead refer to "50%."

 



      
 

 



 

(b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
8.1(f)_, then the Company shall, within three Business Days after the date of

_Section 8.1(g)_, then Parent shall, within three Business Days after the
date of termination, pay the Company the Termination Fee by wire transfer of

(e) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, Parent and the Company, respectively, would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as
applicable, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this _Section
8.3_, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company (as
applicable) commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company
or Parent (as applicable) for the fee set forth in this _Section 8.3_ or any
portion thereof, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the other
party its fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if Parent or the Company
fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 8.3_, then Parent
or the Company, as applicable, shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for

required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is
actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made
plus 300 basis points for the period commencing as of the date that such
overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by the
Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.3_ constitute liquidated damages and
not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach
of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent or the Company,
as applicable, in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in
such section. In no event shall any party be required to pay the Termination
Fee more than once.

 



 

8.4 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this Agreement may
be amended by Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , after any
approval of the Transactions by the shareholders of the Company or the
shareholders of Parent, there may not be, without further approval of such
shareholders, as applicable, any amendment of this Agreement that requires

Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of Parent and the Company.

 



 

8.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of
any of the obligations or other acts of the other party, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party
contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to

 



      
 

 



 

exercise any right or to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other matter.

 **Exhibit A**

 



 

 **FORM OF VOTING AGREEMENT**

 



 

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of April 26, 2017, is
entered into by and between South State Corporation, a South Carolina
corporation (" _Parent_ "), and the undersigned (the " _Shareholder_ "), a
shareholder of Park Sterling Corporation, a North Carolina corporation (the "
_Company_ ").

 



 

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and Plan of
Merger (as the same may be amended, supplemented or modified, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), dated as of the date hereof, between Parent and the Company,
the Company will be merged with and into Parent, with Parent as the surviving
corporation (the " _Merger_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, as of the date of this Agreement, the Shareholder owns beneficially
or of record, and has the power to vote or direct the voting of, certain
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (" _Common
Stock_ ") (all such shares, the " _Existing Shares_ ");

 



 

WHEREAS, as a condition and inducement for Parent to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Parent has required that the Shareholder, in his or her capacity as
a shareholder of the Company, enter into this Agreement, and the Shareholder
has agreed to enter into this Agreement.

 



 

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the mutual covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
agree as follows:

 



 

1. **_Definitions_** **.** Capitalized terms not defined in this Agreement have the meanings assigned to those terms in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

2. **_Effectiveness; Termination_** **. **This Agreement shall be effective upon signing. If the Merger Agreement is terminated for any reason in accordance with its terms, this Agreement shall automatically terminate and be null and void and of no effect; _provided_ that (i) this _Section 2_ and _Sections 10_ through _16_ hereof shall survive any such termination and (ii) such termination shall not relieve any party of any liability or damages resulting from any willful or material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth herein.

 



 

3. **_Voting Agreement_** **. **From the date hereof until the earlier of (a) the Closing and (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms (the " _Support Period_ "), the Shareholder irrevocably and unconditionally hereby agrees that at any meeting (whether annual or special and each postponement, recess, adjournment or continuation thereof) of the Companys shareholders, however called, and in connection with any written consent of the Companys shareholders, the Shareholder shall (i) appear at such meeting or otherwise cause all of his or her Existing Shares and all other shares of Common Stock or voting securities, over which he or she has acquired beneficial or

 



      
 

 



 

record ownership and the power to vote or direct the voting thereof, after the
date hereof (including any shares of Common Stock acquired by means of
purchase, dividend or distribution, or issued upon the exercise of any stock
options to acquire Common Stock or the conversion of any convertible
securities, or pursuant to any other equity awards or derivative securities
(including any Company Equity Awards) or otherwise) (together with the
Existing Shares, the " _Shares_ "), which he or she owns or controls as of the
applicable record date, to be counted as present thereat for purposes of
calculating a quorum, and (ii) vote or cause to be voted (including by proxy
or written consent, if applicable) all such Shares (A) in favor of the
approval of the Merger Agreement and the approval of the Transactions,
including the Merger, (B) in favor of any proposal to adjourn or postpone such
meeting of the Companys shareholders to a later date if there are not
sufficient votes to approve the Merger Agreement and in favor of any advisory,
non-binding compensation proposal set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement and
submitted to the shareholders of the Company in connection with the Merger,
(C) against any action or proposal in favor of an Acquisition Proposal or
Alternative Transaction, without regard to the terms of such Acquisition
Proposal or Alternative Transaction, and (D) against any action, proposal,
transaction, agreement or amendment of the Company Articles of Incorporation
or Company Bylaws, in each case, which would reasonably be likely to (1)
result in a material breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
other obligation or agreement of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement, or of the Shareholder contained in this Agreement, or (2) prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions,
including the Merger. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing commitments
apply to any Shares held by any trust, limited partnership or other entity
holding Shares for which the Shareholder serves in any partner, shareholder,
trustee or similar capacity. To the extent the Shareholder does not control,
by himself or herself, the determinations of such shareholder entity, the
Shareholder agrees to exercise all voting or other determination rights he or
she has in such shareholder entity to carry out the intent and purposes of his
or her support and voting obligations in this paragraph and otherwise set
forth in this Agreement. The Shareholder covenants and agrees that, except for
this Agreement, he or she (x) has not entered into, and shall not enter into
during the Support Period, any voting agreement or voting trust with respect
to the Shares and (y) has not granted, and shall not grant during the Support
Period, a proxy, consent or power of attorney with respect to the Shares
except any proxy to carry out the intent of this Agreement or any proxy
submitted in connection with the Companys annual shareholder meeting
scheduled to be held on May 25, 2017.

 



 

4. **_Transfer Restrictions Prior to the Merger_** **. **The Shareholder hereby agrees that he or she will not, during the Support Period, without the prior written consent of Parent, directly or indirectly, offer for sale, sell, transfer, assign, give, tender in any tender or exchange offer, pledge, encumber, hypothecate or similarly dispose of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise), either voluntarily or involuntarily, enter into any swap or other arrangement that transfers to another, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of, enter into any contract, option or other arrangement or understanding with respect to the sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, encumbrance, hypothecation or other disposition of (by merger, by testamentary disposition, by operation of law or otherwise) or otherwise convey or

 



      
 

 



 

dispose of, any of the Shares, or any interest therein, including the right to
vote any Shares, as applicable (a " _Transfer_ "); _provided_ , that the
Shareholder may (i) Transfer Shares for estate planning or philanthropic
purposes so long as the transferee, prior to the date of Transfer, agrees in a
signed writing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this
Agreement, and the Shareholder provides at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice (which shall include the written consent of the
transferee agreeing to be bound by and comply with the provisions of this
Agreement) to Parent, in which case the Shareholder shall remain responsible
for any breach of this Agreement by such transferee, or Transfer Shares at
such Shareholders death pursuant to Law or such Shareholders estate plan (
_provided_ , that the transferee agrees in a signed writing to be bound by and
comply with the provisions of this Agreement) or (ii) surrender Shares to the
Company in connection with the vesting, settlement or exercise of Company
Equity Awards to satisfy any withholding for the payment of taxes incurred in
connection with such vesting, settlement or exercise, or, in respect of
Company Options, the exercise price thereon. In furtherance of the foregoing,
the Shareholder hereby authorizes the Company to instruct its transfer agent
to enter a stop transfer order with respect to all of the Shares.

 



 

5. **_Representations of the Shareholder_** **.** The Shareholder represents and warrants to Parent as follows: (a) the Shareholder has full legal right, capacity and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform the Shareholders obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby; (b) this Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Shareholder and constitutes a valid and legally binding agreement of the Shareholder, enforceable against the Shareholder in accordance with its terms, and no other action is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder or the performance of his or her obligations hereunder; (c) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Shareholder does not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and the compliance with the provisions hereof will not, conflict with or violate any law or result in any breach of or violation of, or constitute a default (or an event that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any of the Shares pursuant to, any agreement or other instrument or obligation binding upon the Shareholder or the Shares, nor require any authorization, consent or approval of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity; (d) the Shareholder beneficially owns and has the power to vote or direct the voting of the Shares; (e) the Shareholder beneficially owns the Shares free and clear of any proxy, voting restriction, adverse claim or other Lien (other than any restrictions created by this Agreement or under applicable federal or state securities laws); and (f) the Shareholder has read and is familiar with the terms of the Merger Agreement. The Shareholder agrees that the Shareholder shall not take any action that would make any representation or warranty of the Shareholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of preventing, impairing, delaying or adversely affecting the performance by the Shareholder of his or her obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees, without further consideration, to execute and deliver such additional documents and to take such further actions as are necessary or reasonably requested by Parent to confirm and assure the rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement. As used in this Agreement, the terms " _beneficial owner_ ,"

 



      
 

 



 

"beneficially _own_ " and " _beneficial ownership_ " shall have the meaning
set forth in Rule 13d-3 promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

 



 

6. **_Publicity_** **. **The Shareholder hereby authorizes Parent and the Company to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure in connection with the Merger, including in the Form S-4, the Joint Proxy Statement or any other filing with any Governmental Entity made in connection with the Merger, the Shareholders identity and ownership of the Shares and the nature of the Shareholders obligations under this Agreement. The Shareholder agrees to notify Parent as promptly as practicable of any inaccuracies or omissions in any information relating to the Shareholder that is so published or disclosed.

 



 

7. **_Entire Agreement_** **.** This Agreement and, with respect to Parent and the Company, the Merger Agreement, constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than, if the Shareholder is an officer of the Company, with respect to any employment agreement between the Shareholder and the Company, Parent or their respective affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person not a party to this Agreement any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly provided herein, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to vest in Parent any direct or indirect ownership or incidence of ownership of or with respect to any Shares. All rights, ownership and economic benefits of and relating to the Shares shall remain vested in and belong to the Shareholder, and Parent shall have no authority to manage, direct, superintend, restrict, regulate, govern or administer any of the policies or operations of the Company or exercise any power or authority to direct the Shareholder in the voting of any of the Shares, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. This Agreement is intended to create, and creates, a contractual relationship and is not intended to create, and does not create, any agency, partnership, joint venture or other like relationship between the parties.

 



 

8. **_Assignment_** **.** This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the rights under this Agreement are assignable by Parent to a majority-owned affiliate or any successor-in-interest of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Parent of its obligations hereunder.

 



 

9. **_Remedies/Specific Enforcement_** **.** Each of the parties hereto agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically enforceable pursuant to its terms and that Parent would be irreparably harmed if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with its specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the Shareholder of any covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may be entitled (including monetary damages), Parent shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and the

 



      
 

 



 

Shareholder hereby waives any defense in any action for specific performance
or an injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be
adequate. The Shareholder further agrees that neither Parent nor any other
person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the Shareholder irrevocably waives
any right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

 



 

10. **_Governing Law and Enforceability_** **.** This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the State of North Carolina, without regard to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of North Carolina or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of North Carolina.

 



 

In addition, in the event any dispute (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
arises out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, each of
the parties hereto consents in writing to the fullest extent permitted by law,
to the sole and exclusive forum of the state courts of North Carolina in and
for Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, with such dispute being designated by
the party filing the action as a "mandatory complex business case" pursuant to
Section 7A-45.4 of the North Carolina General Statutes and subject to
designation or assignment to the North Carolina Business Court (or, if no
state court located within the State of North Carolina has jurisdiction, the
United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina).

 



 

Each party agrees that service of process upon such party in any such claim,
action or proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in accordance with
_Section 11_.

 



 

11. **_Notice_.** All notices and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered personally, mailed by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) or delivered by nationally recognized overnight courier service if to the Shareholder, to the address set forth in **_Schedule A_** hereto, and if to Parent, in accordance with Section 9.3 of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

12. **_Severability_** **.** Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law. In the event that any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

 



 

13. **_Amendments; Waivers_** **.** Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and signed (a) in the case of an amendment, by Parent and the Shareholder, and (b) in the case of a waiver, by the party

 



      
 

 



 

against whom the waiver is to be effective. No failure or delay by any party
in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or
privilege.

 



 

14. **_Waiver of Jury Trial_** **.** EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER; (II) THE PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER; (III) THE PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY; AND (IV) THE PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 14_.

 



 

15. **_No Representative Capacity_.** Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement applies solely to Shareholder in his or her individual capacity as a shareholder, and, to the extent the Shareholder serves as a member of the board of directors or officer of the Company or as a fiduciary for others, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by the Shareholder in Shareholders capacity as a director or officer or (subject to _Section 3_) as a fiduciary for others, including in exercising rights under the Merger Agreement, and no such actions or omissions shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement or shall be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict Shareholder from discharging Shareholders duties as a director or officer or (subject to _Section 3_) as a fiduciary for others.

 



 

16. **_Counterparts_** **.** The parties may execute this Agreement in one or more counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic signature. All the counterparts will be construed together and will constitute one Agreement.
