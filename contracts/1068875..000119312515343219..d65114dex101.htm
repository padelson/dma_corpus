i STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of October
[12], 2015, is made by and among HDV Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (the " _Seller_ "), Blucora, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Parent_ ") (solely with respect to _Section 9.08_), Project Baseball
Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the
Parent (the " _Purchaser_ "), and HDV Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Company_ "). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings set forth in _Article 11_ below.

WHEREAS, the Seller owns 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company (the " _Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the
Purchaser desires to acquire from the Seller, and the Seller desires to sell
to the Purchaser, all of the Shares;

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors and boards of managers, as
applicable, of the Purchaser, the Seller and the Company have approved this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement for the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, concurrently with the
execution and delivery hereof, the Key Employee is entering into an employment
agreement (the " _Employment Agreement_ ");

 

WHEREAS, as an inducement for the Purchaser to enter into this Agreement and
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, concurrently with the
execution and delivery hereof, each of Roger Ochs and the Rollover Employees
are entering into rollover agreements with the Purchaser, the Company and the
Seller (the " _Rollover Agreements_ "), pursuant to which, immediately prior
to the Closing, the Company will distribute to the Seller, and the Seller will
distribute to the Rollover Employees shares of capital stock of the Company
(the " _Rollover Shares_ "), free and clear of any Liens, and the
Rollover Employees will contribute their Rollover Shares to the Purchaser in
exchange for shares of capital stock of the Purchaser and Roger Ochs will
contribute his Rollover Shares to the Purchaser in exchange for shares of
capital stock of the Purchaser and a promissory note (such transaction, the "
_Rollover_ ");

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants contained herein and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which
are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows: ARTICLE 1

 

 _PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES_

 

1.01 _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, on the Closing Date, (a) the Seller shall sell, assign, transfer and
convey to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and acquire from the
Seller, all of the Shares (other than the Rollover Shares, which for the
avoidance of doubt, shall have been contributed by Roger Ochs and
the Rollover Employees to the Purchaser immediately prior to the Closing as
part of the Rollover), free and clear of any Liens and restrictions on
transfer (other than any restrictions under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and applicable state securities laws), and (b) in consideration of
the sale of the Shares and the covenants and agreements of the Seller
contained herein, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller or its designee
the consideration specified in  _Section 1.02_.

1.02 _Purchase Price_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the aggregate purchase price (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") to be paid for the Shares shall be an amount equal to (i)
$600,000,000 (the " _Base Consideration_ "), _minus_ (ii) Final Indebtedness,
_plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by which Final Net Working Capital exceeds
the Target Net Working Capital,  _minus_ (iv) the amount, if any, by which
Final Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net Working Capital, _plus_
(v) Final Cash, _minus_ (vi) Final Transaction Expenses, _minus_ the Equity
Rollover Amount,  _minus_ the Specified Indemnity Accrued Amount.

(b) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Preliminary Purchase Price_ "
shall be an amount equal to (i) the Base Consideration, _minus_ (ii) Estimated
Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) the amount, if any, by which Estimated Net Working
Capital exceeds the Target Net Working Capital,  _minus_ (iv) the amount, if
any, by which Estimated Net Working Capital is less than the Target Net
Working Capital, _plus_ (v) Estimated Cash, _minus_ (vi) Estimated Transaction
Expenses,, _minus_ (viii) the Escrow Amount, _minus_ the Equity Rollover
Amount, _minus_ the Specified Indemnity Accrued Amount.

1.03 _Estimated Cash, Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Net Working Capital
and Estimated Transaction Expenses_. Not less than two (2) days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser (i) the
Companys good faith calculation of its estimate of (a) the amount of Cash as
of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date ("
_Estimated Cash_ "), (b) Net Working Capital as of the close of business on
the day immediately preceding the Closing Date (" _Estimated Net Working
Capital_ "), (c) the amount of Indebtedness which will be outstanding
immediately prior to the Closing (" _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), (d)
the amount of Transaction Expenses which will be unpaid as of the Closing ("
_Estimated Transaction Expenses_ ") and (e) the Specified Indemnity Accrued
Amount, and (ii) a statement showing the calculation of the
Preliminary Purchase Price.

 



2 1.04 _The Closing Transactions_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement, the parties shall consummate the following transactions on
the Closing Date:

(a) the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller (or, at Sellers discretion,
the Paying Agent) the Preliminary Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by the Seller
to the Purchaser in exchange for the delivery by the Seller to the Purchaser
of the stock certificate(s) evidencing the Shares (other than the Rollover
Shares) duly endorsed for transfer or accompanied by a duly executed stock
power;

 

(b) the Company shall deliver to the Purchaser payoff letters in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Purchaser from each holder
of Indebtedness listed on the _Indebtedness Payoff Schedule_ , which payoff
letters shall provide a mechanism for a full and complete release of all Liens
granted by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, or otherwise arising
with respect to, the holder of such Indebtedness, effective upon repayment of
such Indebtedness;

(c) the Purchaser shall repay, on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
all amounts required to be paid under the payoff letters delivered pursuant to
_Section 1.04(b)_ in order to fully discharge the Indebtedness owed to the
Persons thereunder, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
accounts designated in such payoff letters;

(d) the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller shall make such other
deliveries as are required by _Article 2_ hereof;

(e) the Purchaser shall pay, on behalf of the Seller and the Company and its
Subsidiaries (as applicable), the unpaid Transaction Expenses, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the accounts designated on the
_Transaction Expenses Schedule_ ;

 

(f) the Purchaser shall pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Amount, to be held pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement; and

(g) the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser a certificate, executed by the
Seller under penalties of perjury, stating that the Seller is not a foreign
person in form and substance required under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1445-2(b)(2). The Purchasers only remedy for the Sellers failure to
provide such certificate will be to withhold from the payments to be made
pursuant to this Agreement any required withholding Tax under Section 1445 of
the Code, and the Sellers failure to provide such certificate shall not be
deemed to be a failure of the condition set forth in  _Section 2.01(b)_ to
have been met.

1.05 _Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Net Working Capital and Final
Transaction Expenses Calculations_.

(a) As promptly as possible, but in any event within 90 days after the Closing
Date, the Purchaser will deliver to the Seller (i) a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ ") as
of the close of business on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
(ii) a statement showing the calculation of (A) the amount of Cash derived
from the Closing Balance Sheet as of the close of business on the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, (B) the amount of Indebtedness as of
immediately prior to the Closing, (C) the Net Working Capital derived from
the Closing Balance Sheet as of the close of business on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date, and (D) the amount of Transaction

 



3  Expenses unpaid as of the Closing (together with the Closing Balance Sheet,
the " _Preliminary Statement_ "). If a Preliminary Statement is not delivered
to the Seller within 90 days after the Closing Date, the Preliminary Purchase
Price shall become the Purchase Price and shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto. The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared,
and the amount of Cash, the amount of Indebtedness, the Net Working Capital
and the amount of Transaction Expenses shall be determined, on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP using the same accounting methods, policies,
principles, practices and procedures, with consistent classifications,
judgments and estimation methodology, as were used in preparation of the
Latest Balance Sheet and shall not include any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet and determining the amount of Cash, the amount of Indebtedness, the
Net Working Capital and the amount of Transaction Expenses and the related
purchase price adjustment contemplated by this _Section 1.05_ is to measure
changes in the amount of Cash, the amount of Indebtedness, the Net Working
Capital and the amount of Transaction Expenses, and such processes are not
intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Closing Balance
Sheet or determining the amount of Cash, the amount of Indebtedness, the Net
Working Capital and the amount of Transaction Expenses. After delivery of the
Preliminary Statement, the Seller and its accountants shall have 60 days to
review the Preliminary Statement and during such time shall be permitted full
access to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and
work papers related to the preparation of the Preliminary Statement
as reasonably requested by the Seller; provided that such access shall be in
a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Seller and
its accountants may make inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective personnel and accountants regarding
questions concerning, or disagreements with, the Preliminary Statement arising
in the course of their review thereof; provided that such inquiries shall be
in a manner that does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business
operations of the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries, and the
Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to
use their, commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such personnel and
accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries.

(b) If the Seller has any objections to the Preliminary Statement, the Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections
thereto (an " _Objections Statement_ "). If an Objections Statement is not
delivered to the Purchaser within 60 days after delivery of the Preliminary
Statement, the Preliminary Statement shall be final, binding and non-
appealable by the parties hereto; _provided_ that, in the event
the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does not provide any
papers or documents reasonably requested by the Seller or any of its
authorized representatives that are in existence as of the time of such
request within five Business Days of request therefor (or such shorter period
as may remain in such 60-day period), such 60-day period shall be extended by
one Business Day for each additional day required for the Purchaser, the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries to fully respond to such request. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 15 days after
the delivery of the Objections Statement, the Seller and the Purchaser
shall submit such dispute to

 



4  PricewaterhouseCoopers; _provided_ that, if PricewaterhouseCoopers is unable
or unwilling to serve in such capacity, the Seller and the Purchaser shall
jointly select an alternative arbiter from a nationally recognized
independent public accounting firm that is not the independent auditor of any
of the Purchaser, the Seller or the Company (PricewaterhouseCoopers or the
Person so selected, as applicable, the " _Dispute Resolution Auditor_ ").
Each of the Seller and the Purchaser may furnish to the Dispute Resolution
Auditor such information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of
such submission and all such documents and information being
concurrently given to the other party. The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall
consider only those items and amounts which are identified in the Objections
Statement as being items which the Seller and the Purchaser are unable to
resolve. The Dispute Resolution Auditors determination will be based solely
on the definitions of Cash, Indebtedness, Net Working Capital and Transaction
Expenses contained herein and any defined terms incorporated therein. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor to resolve all disagreements as soon as
practicable. Further, the Dispute Resolution Auditors determination shall be
based solely on the supporting material provided by the Purchaser and the
Seller which are in accordance with the terms and procedures set forth in this
Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review) and may not assign
a value to any particular item greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either party or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by
either party, in each case as presented to the Dispute Resolution Auditor. The
resolution of the dispute by the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be
final, binding and non-appealable on the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any disputes regarding the dispute resolution process set forth in
this _Section 1.05(b)_ shall be submitted to a court of competent
jurisdiction in accordance with _Section 12.11_ and _Section 12.16_. The
costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be allocated
between the Purchaser and the Seller based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount
actually contested by such party. For example, if the Seller claims the amount
of Cash is $1,000 greater than the amount determined by the
Purchasers accountants, the Purchaser contests only $500 of the amount
claimed by the Seller, and the Dispute Resolution Auditor ultimately resolves
the dispute by awarding the Seller $300 of the $500 contested, then the costs
and expenses of the Dispute Resolution Auditor will be allocated 60% (i.e.,
300 ÷ 500) to the Purchaser and 40% (i.e., 200 ÷ 500) to the Seller. The
amount of Cash, the amount of Indebtedness, the Net Working Capital and the
amount of Transaction Expenses as finally determined pursuant to this
_Section 1.05(b)_ shall be referred to herein as " _Final Cash_ ," " _Final
Indebtedness_ ," " _Final Net Working Capital_ " and " _Final
Transaction Expenses_."

(c) If, after final determination of Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Net
Working Capital and Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to this _Section
1.05_, the Preliminary Purchase Price is less than the Purchase Price (such
shortfall, the " _Shortfall Amount_ "), then the Purchaser shall, within two
(2) Business Days after Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Net Working
Capital and Final Transaction Expenses become final and binding on the parties
pursuant to this _Section 1.05_, make payment of the Shortfall Amount by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Seller (or, at the Sellers
discretion, to the Paying Agent). Promptly following such payment, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct the Escrow Agent to release the
remaining funds, if any, in the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Seller.

 



5 (d) If, after final determination of Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Net
Working Capital and Final Transaction Expenses pursuant to this _Section
1.05_, the Preliminary Purchase Price is greater than the Purchase Price (such
excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then the Seller and the Purchaser shall,
within two (2) Business Days after Final Cash, Final Indebtedness, Final Net
Working Capital and Final Transaction Expenses become final and binding on the
parties pursuant to this _Section 1.05_, instruct the Escrow Agent to release
from the Adjustment Escrow Account, the Excess Amount to the Purchaser. In
the event the funds held in the Adjustment Escrow Account are not sufficient
to pay the Excess Amount in full to the Purchaser, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall, within two (2) Business Days after Final Cash, Final
Indebtedness, Final Net Working Capital and Final Transaction Expenses become
final and binding on the parties pursuant to this _Section 1.05_, instruct
the Escrow Agent to release from the Indemnity Escrow Account an amount equal
to (i) the Excess Amount _minus_ (ii) the amount distributed to the Purchaser
from the Adjustment Escrow Account pursuant to this _Section 1.05(d)_.
Promptly following such payment, the Purchaser and the Seller shall instruct
the Escrow Agent to release the remaining funds, if any, in the Adjustment
Escrow Account to the Seller.

 

(e) The Purchaser agrees that the Adjustment Escrow Amount and the Indemnity
Escrow Amount, and the dispute resolution provisions provided for in this
_Section 1.05_, shall be the exclusive remedies for the matters addressed or
that could be addressed by this _Section 1.05_, and neither the Seller nor
any of its Affiliates shall have liabilities for any amounts due, owing or
payable to the Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 1.05(e)_ to the extent the
funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account and the Indemnity Escrow Amount are
insufficient to pay such amounts.

 

(f) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties hereto agree that
any payment made pursuant to this _Section 1.05_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to purchase price for all Tax purposes.

1.06 _The Closing_. The parties shall cause the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") to take place at the
offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP located at 300 North LaSalle Street, Chicago,
Illinois 60654 on the third (3rd) Business Day following full satisfaction or
due waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in _Article 2_ hereof
(other than those to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction of such conditions at the Closing) or on such other date as the
Purchaser and the Seller may mutually agree; _provided_ that, unless (a)
consented to in writing by the Purchaser prior to December 30, 2015 or (b) all
conditions to the Purchasers obligations in respect of the funding of the
Debt Financing have been satisfied prior to such date (other than those to be
satisfied at the time of such funding, but subject to the satisfaction of such
conditions at the time of such funding), the Closing shall occur no
earlier than December 30, 2015 (provided, that for the avoidance of doubt,
the notice described in Section 8.01(f) may be delivered three Business Days
prior to December 30, 2015). The date of the Closing is referred to herein as
the " _Closing Date_ ," and the Closing shall be deemed effective as of 12:01
a.m. Eastern Time on the Closing Date.

 



6 1.07 _Withholding_. The parties, as well as their respective Affiliates, shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as are required
to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any applicable provision of
federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law or under any applicable legal
requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been
paid; _provided_ that, if the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates determines
that an amount is required to be deducted and withheld, the Purchaser shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, at least five (5) Business
Days prior to the date the applicable payment is scheduled to be made, the
Seller with written notice of the intent to deduct and withhold, which notice
shall include a copy of the calculation of the amount to be deducted and
withheld. The Purchaser shall provide the Seller with a reasonable opportunity
to provide forms or other evidence that would exempt such amounts from
withholding.

1.08 _EBITDA Adjustment_.

 

(a) On or prior to April 30, 2016, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Seller a
copy of the Companys audited consolidated financial statements for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2015, together with a statement (the " _2015
EBITDA Statement_ ") setting forth its determination of the Adjusted EBITDA of
the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2015
(the " _2015 Adjusted EBITDA_ "). After delivery by the Purchaser of the 2015
EBITDA Statement, the Seller and its accountants shall have 60 days to review
the 2015 EBITDA Statement and during such time shall be permitted full access
to review the Companys and its Subsidiaries books and records and work
papers related to the preparation of the 2015 EBITDA Statement as reasonably
requested by the Seller; provided that such access shall be in a manner that
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the
Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries. The Seller and its accountants may
make inquiries of the Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective accountants regarding questions concerning, or disagreements
with, the 2015 EBITDA Statement arising in the course of their review thereof;
provided that such inquiries shall be in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the normal business operations of the Purchaser, the Company
or its Subsidiaries, and the Purchaser shall use its, and shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to use their, commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any such accountants to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries.

(b) If the Seller has any objections to the 2015 EBITDA Statement, the Seller
shall deliver to the Purchaser a statement setting forth its objections
thereto then known based on the access and information provided by the
Purchaser through such date (a " _2015 EBITDA Objections Statement_ "). If a
2015 EBITDA Objections Statement is not delivered to the Purchaser within 60
days after delivery of the 2015 EBITDA Statement, the 2015 EBITDA Statement
shall be final, binding and non-appealable by the parties hereto; provided
that, in the event the Purchaser, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does
not provide any papers or documents reasonably requested by the Seller or any
of its authorized representatives that are in existence as of the time of such
request within five Business Days of request therefor (or such shorter period
as may remain in such 60-day period), such 60-day period shall be extended by
one Business Day for each additional day required for the Purchaser, the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries to fully respond to such request.
Following the delivery of the 2015 EBITDA Objections Statement, the Seller may
update the 2015 EBITDA Objections Statement to reflect

 



7  any change in objections to the extent such changes are in respect of new
information received from the Purchaser after the date of such delivery. The
Seller and the Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
objections, but if they do not reach a final resolution within 60 days after
the delivery of the 2015 EBITDA Objections Statement, the Seller and the
Purchaser shall submit such dispute to the Dispute Resolution Auditor. Each
of the Seller and the Purchaser may furnish to the Dispute Resolution Auditor
such information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of such
submission and all such documents and information being concurrently given to
the other party. The Dispute Resolution Auditor shall consider only those
items and amounts which are identified to the Dispute Resolution Auditor from
the 2015 EBITDA Objections Statement as being items which the Seller and the
Purchaser have been unable to resolve. The Dispute Resolution Auditors
determination will be based solely on the definition of Adjusted EBITDA
contained herein. The Seller and the Purchaser shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Dispute Resolution Auditor to resolve all
disagreements as soon as practicable. Further, the Dispute Resolution
Auditors determination shall be based solely on the supporting material
provided by the Purchaser and the Seller which are in accordance with the
terms and procedures set forth in this Agreement (i.e., not on the basis of an
independent review) and may not assign a value to any particular item greater
than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or less than
the lowest value for such item claimed by either party, in each case as
presented to the Dispute Resolution Auditor. The resolution of the dispute by
the Dispute Resolution Auditor shall be final, binding and non-appealable on
the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any disputes regarding the
dispute resolution process set forth in this _Section 1.08(b)_ shall be
submitted to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section
12.11_ and _Section 12.16_. The costs and expenses of the Dispute Resolution
Auditor shall be allocated between the Purchaser and the Seller based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each
party bears to the amount actually contested by such party. The 2015 Adjusted
EBITDA as finally determined pursuant to this _Section 1.08(b)_ shall be
referred to herein as the " _Actual 2015 Adjusted EBITDA_."

(c) If the Actual 2015 Adjusted EBITDA is less than $46,164,000, then the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Purchaser
or its designee, a payment (the " _2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Purchaser, which 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment shall be calculated as follows:

(i) If the Actual 2015 Adjusted EBITDA is less than $44,625,200.00, then the
2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment shall be equal to $20,000,000.

(ii) If the Actual 2015 Adjusted EBITDA is greater than or equal to
$46,164,000, then the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment shall be equal to $0.

(iii) If the Actual 2015 Adjusted EBITDA is less than $46,164,000 but greater
than or equal to $44,625,200.00, then the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment shall
be determined by linear interpolation between $0 and $20,000,000 (i.e., for
each $1.00 by which the Actual 2015 Adjusted EBITDA is less than $46,164,000,
the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment shall be increased by $13.00 (but shall not
be greater than $20,000,000).

 



8 (d) To the extent there is any portion of the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Escrow
Amount remaining after the payment of the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment, the
Purchaser and the Seller shall cause the Escrow Agent to pay to the Seller
(or, at the Sellers discretion, the Paying Agent) such remaining portion by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
Seller.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 1.08_, if
the Purchaser fails to deliver the 2015 EBITDA Statement on or prior to April
30, 2016, then the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment shall be deemed to be equal to
$0.

 

(f) As used in this _Section 1.08_:

 

(i) " _Adjusted EBITDA_ " of any Person means, for any period, an amount equal
to the sum of (i) the net income of such Person, determined in accordance
with GAAP, consistently applied, plus (ii) to the extent deducted or not
included in determining subsection (i) for such period, and without
duplication, (A) Consolidated Interest Expense, amortization of debt
discounts and commissions, (B) income tax expense determined on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP, (C) depreciation and amortization determined on
a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP, (D) all actual out-of-pocket
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Existing Loan Agreements and any related
transactions or this Agreement and any related transactions, (E) any loss or
charge from extraordinary items, (F) any aggregate net loss on the sale of
property (other than accounts (as defined under the applicable UCC) and
inventory) outside the ordinary course of business, (G) management fees and
expenses and transaction fees paid pursuant to and in accordance with the
management agreement with certain of the equityholders of the Seller, (H) all
non-cash (and, with respect to clause (y), cash) costs, expenses, losses and
charges (other than the write-down of current assets) for such period
(including non-cash compensation expenses and amounts representing non-cash
adjustments) required by the application of (x) FASB Statement No. 144
(relating to write-down of long-lived assets), (y) FASB Statement No. 141R
(including with respect to "earnouts" incurred as deferred consideration in
connection with a Permitted Acquisition) and (z) FASB Statement No. 142
(relating to changes in accounting for amortization of goodwill and certain
intangibles) as established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(pertaining to purchase method accounting), (I) severance costs or one-time
compensation expenses paid to employees or investment advisors, (J) non-cash
charges or expenses incurred in such period in connection with the write-off
of deferred financing costs, (K) costs and expenses associated with
maintaining a corporate debt rating, (L) in connection with one-time
marketing and technology projects and client billing and ticket charge issues,
(M) non-recurring legal and consulting fees, (N) any balance sheet reserves or
accruals established in respect of any liability on the _Special Indemnity
Schedule_ and (O) costs and expenses paid associated with satisfying any
liability on the _Special Indemnity Schedule_. _Schedule 1.08_ attached
hereto sets forth an example of the 

 



9  calculation of Adjusted EBITDA as of the date of the Latest Balance Sheet.
Adjusted EBITDA shall be calculated in accordance with _Schedule 1.08_ and
only include the line items set forth therein.

(ii) " _Consolidated Interest Expense_ " means, for the Company and its
Subsidiaries for any period determined on a consolidated basis in accordance
with GAAP, the sum of (i) the total interest expense and loan fees, including
the interest component of any payments in respect of capital lease obligations
capitalized or expensed during such period (whether or not actually paid
during such period) _plus_ (ii) the net cash amount payable (or _minus_ the
net cash amount received) with respect to hedging transactions during such
period.

 

(g) To the extent the total amount of bonuses paid to employees from January
1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 pursuant to any Plan in existence as of the
date hereof is less than the total amount that would be paid to such employees
pursuant to such Plans in the ordinary course consistent with the Companys
and its Subsidiaries past practices (with the parties acknowledging that
implementation of such payments of bonuses shall be done at the direction of
the Chief Executive Officer of the Company consistent with his past
practices), whether due to the Companys or any Subsidiarys failure to
pay such bonus or forfeiture or waiver thereof by the recipient or otherwise,
except in the case of any employee that was not eligible for such bonus
pursuant to the terms of the applicable Plan, the Adjusted EBITDA shall be
calculated as though such payment had been made. If the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action during the period from and after the
Closing through December 31, 2015 (or make any change in the Companys or any
of its Subsidiaries accounting methods with respect to the measurement of
any accrued liabilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the calendar
year ended December 31, 2015 during the time period between January 1, 2016
and the date on which the 2015 EBITDA Statement is delivered) that is
inconsistent with the ordinary operations and past practices of the Company
and its Subsidiaries prior to the date hereof (other than actions that are
required by applicable Law) , the calculation of the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA
shall not be increased or reduced on account of any of the revenues, costs,
expense or other effects on net income resulting directly from such actions.

 

(h) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall have sole discretion with
regard to all matters relating to the operation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries; provided that from the Closing until December 31, 2015, the
Purchaser shall, and shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to:

 

(i) pursue all of the Companys and its Subsidiaries operations consistent
with the level of activity conducted by the Company and its Subsidiaries
during the year prior to the Closing Date to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, and in any event with no less diligence than the level of
activity the Purchaser uses for its other businesses;

 

(ii) operate the Company and its Subsidiaries separate from the Purchasers
and the Purchasers Affiliates existing businesses, including by maintaining
separate books and records and generating separate financial statements, which
statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, for the Company and its
Subsidiaries;

 



10 (iii) cause any goods and services sold by the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the Purchaser or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or purchased by the Company and its Subsidiaries from the
Purchaser or its Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries) to
be made on terms comparable to those that would be realized or paid if
dealing with an independent party in an arms-length commercial transaction;

(iv) maintain the Companys current compensation practices (other than
equity-based compensation), including with respect to the Companys bonus
compensation plan, in the ordinary course of business and consistent with past
practice (with the parties acknowledging that implementation of such
compensation practices shall be implemented at the direction of the Chief
Executive Officer of the Company consistent with his past practices);

 

(v) refrain from diverting any revenues from the Company and its Subsidiaries
to the Purchasers other businesses or to any Affiliates of the Purchaser;

(vi) refrain from making any changes to the Companys or its
Subsidiaries accounting methods, principles or practices or Tax methods,
practices or elections;

(vii) refrain from changing the legal structure of Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in existence as of the date hereof or the legal structure within
which any one or more of the divisions thereof operate as of the date hereof;

 

(viii) refrain from acquiring any business or entering into any new line of
business and any restructuring or integration matters related thereto;

(ix) refrain from taking any actions with respect to the sale, disposition or
other divestiture of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any one or
more of their divisions or lines of business; and

(x) refrain from taking any actions in bad faith that would have the purpose
of reducing the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA or increasing the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA
Payment hereunder.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 1.08_ to the contrary, the
Purchaser has no obligation to operate the Company and its Subsidiaries in
order to maximize the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA or the 2015 Adjusted EBITDA Payment
hereunder.

(j) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the parties hereto agree
that any payment made pursuant to this _Section 1.08_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to purchase price for all Tax purposes.

other Governmental Authority which would adversely affect the Purchasers
performance under this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

4.05 _Brokerage_. Except for GCA Savvian and Wells Fargo, no Person is
entitled to any brokerage commissions, finders fees or similar compensation
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on
any arrangement or agreement made by or on behalf of the Purchaser.

 

4.06 _Financing_. The Purchaser has delivered to the Company true, correct and
complete copies of an executed commitment letter and related engagement and
fee letters (except that fee amounts, pricing caps and other economic terms
(none of which would adversely affect the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing) set forth therein have been redacted, provided that if any of the
fee letters include market flex provisions, the existence of such provisions,
but not the economic terms thereof shall be disclosed to the Company, except
to the extent that such economic terms could adversely affect the amount or
availability of the Debt Financing), each attached hereto as _Exhibit A_ ,
from the parties identified therein committing (and any other

 



35  person that from time to time may commit to provide debt financing
thereunder), subject to (and only to) the terms and conditions expressly set
forth therein, to provide up to $425,000,000 in the aggregate of debt
financing to the Person(s) identified in such commitment letter (such
commitment letter, together with all term sheets and attachments thereto and
the fee and engagement letters executed in connection therewith, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ ," and the debt financing committed pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter, the " _Debt Financing_ "). Other than the letters
comprising the Debt Commitment Letter, there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements related to the Debt Financing. At
the Closing, assuming the funding in full of the Debt Financing in accordance
with the Debt Commitment Letter, the Purchaser will have sufficient
unrestricted cash on hand to pay all obligations of the Purchaser hereunder,
including (a) the payments required to be made by the Purchaser at the Closing
pursuant to _Section 1.04_, and (b) all of the out-of-pocket costs then owed
by the Purchaser arising from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The obligations to fund the commitments under
the Debt Commitment Letter are not subject to any condition, other than the
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. The Debt Commitment
Letter has been duly executed and delivered by the Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, each other Person party thereto, and the Debt
Commitment Letter is in full force and effect as of the date hereof
and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of the Purchaser and, to the
knowledge of the Purchaser, each other Person party thereto. The Debt
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner that could
adversely affect the initial amount or availability of the Debt Financing or
expand the conditions precedent set forth therein, no such amendment or
modification is contemplated or the subject of current discussions (other than
any amendment or modification pursuant to which additional lenders commit to
provide a portion of the debt financing thereunder and become a party to the
Debt Commitment Letter), and the commitments contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter have not been withdrawn or rescinded in any respect. There are no
fees, expense reimbursement obligations or other amounts that are required to
be paid by the Purchaser prior to Closing under or in respect of the Debt
Commitment Letter, except as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter. As of
the date hereof, (x) no event has occurred or circumstance exists which, with
or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be
expected to constitute a default or breach under the Debt Commitment Letter
and (y) the Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that any of the
conditions to the financings contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter will
not be satisfied on the Closing Date or that the full amount of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to be available on the
Closing Date will not be made available on the Closing Date. Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section 4.06_ or elsewhere in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Purchaser affirms, represents and warrants that (A) it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement
that it obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (B) the obligations of the Purchaser under
this Agreement are not contingent in any respect upon the funding of the
amounts contemplated to be funded pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, and
(iii) the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement are not subject to
any conditions regarding the Purchasers, its respective Affiliates, or any
other Persons ability to obtain financing for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4.07 _Solvency_. Assuming the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article 3_ are true and correct, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by

 



36  this Agreement, the Company and each of its Subsidiaries shall be able to
pay their respective debts as they become due and shall own property which has
a fair saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their
respective debts (including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all
contingent liabilities). Assuming the representations and warranties set forth
in _Article 3_ are true and correct, immediately after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries shall have adequate capital to carry on their respective
businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors
of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

4.08 _Securities Act_. The Purchaser is acquiring the Shares for its own
account, with the present intention of holding such Shares for investment
purposes only and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, the
distribution thereof in violation of federal or state securities Laws. The
Purchaser understands that the Shares may not be sold, transferred or
otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act, except
pursuant to an exemption from such registration available under the Securities
Act. The Purchaser is knowledgeable about the industries in which the Company
and the Subsidiaries operate and is capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and is able to bear
the economic risk of such investment. The Purchaser has been afforded access
to the books and records, facilities and personnel of the Company and the
Subsidiaries for purposes of conducting a due diligence investigation and has
conducted a due diligence investigation of the Company and the Subsidiaries.

 

4.09 Disqualification.

"associated" (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act) with the Purchaser

disqualification that would be a basis for denial, suspension or revocation
of registration of an investment adviser under Section 203(e) of the
Investment Advisers Act.

 

(b) The Purchaser has not been subject to any disciplinary event that would be
required to be disclosed on the Adviser Subsidiarys Form ADV.

convicted of any crime or is or has been subject to any disqualification that
would be a basis for denial, suspension or revocation of registration of a
broker-dealer under Section 15 of the Exchange Act.

bear any cost or expense, pay any fee or incur any Liability or make any
commitment or agreement effective in connection with the Debt Financing prior
to the Closing and (B) the Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to
the Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that the
Purchaser obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions

_provided_ that (a) such access does not unreasonably interfere with the
normal operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (b) such access
shall occur in such a manner as the Company reasonably determines to be
appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (c) all requests for such access shall be directed to Roger

e-mail) from time to time (collectively, the " _Designated Contacts_ "), and
(d) nothing herein shall require the Company to provide access to, or to
disclose any information to, the Purchaser or any of its representatives if
such access or disclosure (x) would cause significant competitive harm to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not consummated, (y) would waive any legal privilege or
(z) would be in violation of applicable Laws of any Governmental Authority
(including the HSR Act and all other applicable antitrust or competition Laws)

representatives and Affiliates not to) contact any officer, director,
employee, customer, supplier, distributor, lessee, lessor, lender, noteholder
or other material business relation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing without the prior written consent of the Company.

6.04 _Client and Customer Approvals_. The Company shall use its commercially

BD Contracts in accordance with the requirements of each such BD Contract and
as and to the extent applicable all Insurance Arrangements in accordance with

matters will be deemed to have been granted if such Client continues to

reasonable steps to keep the Purchaser informed of the status of obtaining
such Consents and, upon the Purchasers request, make available to the
Purchaser all such executed Consents, and any evidence of Persons declining to
consent or withdrawing any Consents. Purchaser shall be provided a reasonable

promptly apprise the Purchaser of the occurrence and substance of each
communication from or to FINRA or the SEC with respect to the FINRA Consent
Application and otherwise comply with the provisions of _Section 9.07_ of

respective controlled Affiliates, representatives, consultants,
financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents to not take, any
action, directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, encourage, initiate or engage
in discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, any Person
(other than the Purchaser and the Purchasers representatives) concerning any
purchase of any of the Shares or any shares of capital stock or

 



43  other equity of any of the Companys Subsidiaries or any merger,
consolidation, reorganization, business combination or sale of substantially
all the assets involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
similar transactions involving the Company of any of its Subsidiaries (a
"Competing Acquisition Proposal"); (ii) enter into any agreement regarding any
Competing Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) otherwise cooperate with, assist,
participate in, facilitate or otherwise encourage any effort or attempt by any
Person to make a Competing Acquisition Proposal.

 

(b) The Seller, the Company and the Companys Subsidiaries shall notify the
Purchaser immediately (i) of any Competing Acquisition Proposal; (ii) of any
inquiry received by the Seller, the Company, any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any of their respective Affiliates, representatives, consultants, financial

confidential information concerning the Company, any of the Companys
Subsidiaries or their business in connection with a Competing
Acquisition Proposal; and (iv) if any Person seeks to initiate or continue
any discussions or negotiations with the Seller, the Company, the Companys
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, representatives,
consultants, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants or other agents
retained or engaged by the Seller, the Company or the Companys Subsidiaries
concerning a Competing Acquisition Proposal.

 

6.07 _R andW Insurance Efforts_. The Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Purchaser,
and shall take such other actions as the Purchaser may reasonably request and
which are customary for a buyer-side representations and warranties insurance
policy, in order to assist the Purchaser in obtaining the RandW Insurance
Policy; provided, however, that none of the Seller, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to make any monetary expenditure pursuant to
this _Section 6.07_.

 

6.08 _Notification_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall disclose to the
Purchaser in writing any material variances from the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement, and any fact or event that constitutes
a material breach of the covenants in this Agreement made by the Seller, the
Company or its Subsidiaries promptly upon discovery thereof.

 

6.09 _Section 280G_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to seek from each Person to whom any payment or benefit
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) is required or
proposed to be made that could constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) a written agreement waiving such Persons
right to receive some or all of such payment or benefit (the "Waived
Benefits") so that all remaining payments or benefits applicable to such
Person shall not be deemed an excess parachute payment and the deduction of
such remaining payments or benefits will not be limited by the application of
Section 280G(a) of the Code, and accepting in substitution for the Waived
Benefits the right to receive the Waived Benefits only if approved by the
shareholders of the Company in a manner that complies with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder. In
no event shall Seller or the Company be required to make any payments or
provide anything of value to such Persons in an effort to

 



44  seek such waivers. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take all necessary actions to submit for and seek
approval by the equityholders of the Seller, in a manner that satisfies
Section 280G(b)(5) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder,
the right of each such Person to receive or retain, as applicable, such
Persons Waived Benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
this _Section 6.09_ shall be interpreted to exclude and shall not take into
account the effect of any payments to be made under arrangements negotiated by
Purchaser or its Affiliates (including payments to be made under
such arrangements by the Company and its Subsidiaries) unless such payments
are disclosed to Seller in writing prior to the date hereof.

destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the
Company or its Subsidiaries for any period prior to the Closing Date without
first giving reasonable prior notice to the Seller and offering to surrender
to the Seller such books and records or any portion thereof which the
Purchaser or the Company or its Subsidiaries may intend to destroy, alter or
dispose of.

7.02 _Notification_. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, the Purchaser shall disclose to the Seller in writing any
material variances from the representations and warranties contained in
_Article 4_ , and any fact or event that constitutes a material breach of the
covenants in this Agreement made by the Purchaser promptly upon discovery
thereof.

7.03 _Director and Officer Liability and Indemnification_.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing, the Purchaser shall not,
and shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to, amend, repeal
or otherwise modify any provision in the Companys or any of its Subsidiaries
certificate of incorporation or

 



45  formation, bylaws or limited liability company agreement (or equivalent
governing document) in any manner that would adversely affect the exculpation
or indemnification rights of any managers, directors and/or officers of the
Company or its Subsidiaries with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Closing Date existing in such certificate of incorporation or
formation, bylaws or limited liability company agreement (or equivalent
governing document) as of immediately prior to the Closing (unless required by
Law), it being the intent of the parties that the managers, directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue to be entitled to
such exculpation and indemnification for any acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Closing Date to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

(b) In addition to the other rights provided for in this _Section 7.03_, and
not in limitation thereof, from and after the Closing, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and the Purchaser shall cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnifying Party_") to, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, (i) indemnify and hold harmless (and release from
any Liability to the Purchaser or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries),
current and former managers, directors and officers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (each, a " _D andO Indemnitee_") against all DandO Expenses (as
defined below), Losses, claims, damages, judgments or amounts paid in
settlement (collectively, " _D andO Costs_") in respect of any threatened,
pending or completed claim, action, suit or proceeding, whether criminal,
civil, administrative or investigative, based on, arising out of or relating
to the fact that such Person is or was a manager, director or officer of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries and arising out of acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing (a " _D andO Indemnifiable Claim_") and
(ii) advance to such DandO Indemnitees all DandO Expenses incurred in connection
with any DandO Indemnifiable Claim (including in circumstances where the DandO
Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of such claim) promptly after
receipt of reasonably detailed statements therefor; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Person to whom DandO Expenses are to be advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to such indemnification under applicable Law. Any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim shall continue until such DandO Indemnifiable Claim is
disposed of or all judgments, orders, decrees or other rulings in connection
with such DandO Indemnifiable Claim are fully satisfied. For the purposes of
this _Section 7.03(b)_, " _D andO Expenses_" means attorneys fees and all
other costs, charges and expenses paid or incurred in connection with
investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including
on appeal), or preparing to defend, be a witness in or participate in any DandO
Indemnifiable Claim, but shall exclude Losses, judgments and amounts paid in
settlement (which items are included in the definition of DandO Costs).

(c) At the Closing, the Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Company to, obtain
and maintain irrevocable "tail" insurance policies naming the DandO Indemnitees
as direct beneficiaries with a claims period of at least six (6) years from
the Closing Date from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing or occurring at
or prior to the Closing, which premium for such "tail" insurance policies
shall be shared equally by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall
not, and shall cause the Company not to, cancel or change such insurance
policies in any respect, except as required by applicable Law.

 



46 (d) In the event the Purchaser, the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case
the Purchaser, the Company or its Subsidiaries shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide that the successors and assigns of the Purchaser
or the Company or its Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this _Section 7.03_.

(e) The DandO Indemnitees are express and intended third-party beneficiaries of
the provisions of this _Section 7.03_ and shall be entitled to independently
enforce the terms hereof as if they were each a party to this Agreement.

 

7.04 _Employment and Benefit Arrangements_. For at least one (1) year
following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the Company to provide to
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries base salary that is no
less favorable than the base salary provided to such employees immediately
prior to the Closing Date and benefits (including bonus opportunities and
severance entitlements but excluding equity based arrangements) that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the benefits (other than equity
based arrangements) provided to such employees immediately prior to the
Closing. The Purchaser shall take all actions required so that employees of
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall receive service credit for
eligibility and vesting purposes and for purposes of determining vacation
accruals or severance amounts under any successor benefit or compensation
plans, programs, policies, contracts, agreements and arrangements sponsored by
the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries) (other than any equity based plan or arrangement) for which
such employees are eligible, for service with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, to the same extent such service was
recognized immediately prior to the Closing for similar purposes under the
Plans to the same extent as eligibility and vesting credit for service with
Purchaser or its Affiliates is provided to Purchasers or its Affiliates
other employees. To the extent that the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) modifies any group welfare
coverage or benefit plan under which the employees of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries participate within the one (1) year following the Closing,
the Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive or cause
to be waived any applicable waiting periods, pre-existing condition exclusions
or actively-at-work requirements and (ii) give such employees credit under
the new coverages or benefit plans for deductibles, co-insurance and other
out-of-pocket payments that have been made during the year in which such
coverage or plan modification occurs. This _Section 7.04_ shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of the Purchaser and the Company and its
Subsidiaries but shall in no way limit the ability of the Purchaser and the
Company and its Subsidiaries or any successor or assign to amend or terminate
Plans (as long as the requirements of this Section 7.04 are otherwise
satisfied) or terminate the employment of any employee and this Section 7.04
shall not be considered an amendment of any Plan.

7.05 Employee Matters. Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause the
Company and its Subsidiaries to comply in all material respects with the WARN
Act, including providing any required notices and complying with any required
waiting periods as a result of any action taken by the Purchaser, the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries on or after the Closing.

 



47 7.06 _FINRA Filings_. The Purchaser shall have provided all information
reasonably requested by the Company to cause the filing of the FINRA Consent
Application in accordance with Section 6.05(a). Without limiting the
generality of _Section 9.07_ and _Section 9.02_ of this Agreement, during
the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Purchaser
shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist the Company in obtaining as
promptly as practicable all clearances, permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of FINRA and in complying with the terms and/or satisfying the
conditions of all such clearances, permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of FINRA as promptly as practicable.

 

7.07 _Post-Closing Regulatory Matters_.

 

(i) Following the Closing, the Purchaser shall cause (a) the Adviser
Subsidiary promptly to amend its Form ADV and (b) the BD Subsidiary promptly
to amend its Form BD and, in each case, to promptly file such amendment with
the SEC and any applicable Governmental Authorities, for the purpose of
disclosing, inter alia, information regarding the change of control of
such Adviser Subsidiary or BD Subsidiary, as applicable, and any changes in
personnel following the Closing.

7.08 _Purchaser s Solvency_. The Purchaser shall furnish or cause to be
furnished to the Company and the Seller copies of any solvency opinions or
similar materials obtained by the Purchaser from third parties in connection
with the financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the
extent contractually permitted by the issuer of such opinion. The Purchaser
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the firms issuing any such
solvency opinions to allow the Company and the Seller to rely thereon.

7.09 _Acknowledgment of the Purchaser_. The Purchaser acknowledges that in
making its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement it has conducted to its satisfaction an independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
Liabilities, properties and projected operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, and the Purchaser has relied on the results of its own
independent investigation and the representations and warranties of the
Company and the Seller expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement,
including the Disclosure Schedules hereto, and the other agreements,
instruments and documents required hereby. Such representations and warranties
by the Company and the Seller in this Agreement, including the Disclosure
Schedules hereto, and the other agreements, instruments and documents
required hereby constitute the sole and exclusive representations and
warranties of or regarding the Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries to the
Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and
the Purchaser understands, acknowledges and agrees that all other
representations and warranties of any kind or nature expressed or implied
(including, but not limited to, any relating to the future or historical
financial condition, results of operations, assets or Liabilities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or the quality, quantity or condition of the
Companys or its Subsidiaries assets) are specifically disclaimed by the
Seller, the Company and its Subsidiaries. Except as expressly

 



48  set forth in this Agreement, including the Disclosure Schedules hereto, and
each of the other agreements, instruments and documents required hereby to be
executed and delivered by the Seller and the Company, the Seller, the Company
and its Subsidiaries do not make or provide, and the Purchaser hereby waives,
any warranty or representation, express or implied, as to the quality,
merchantability, as for a particular purpose, or condition of the Companys
and its Subsidiaries assets or any part thereto. In connection with the
Purchasers investigation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Purchaser
has received certain projections, including projected statements of operating
revenues and income from operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
certain business plan information. The Purchaser acknowledges that there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections and
other forecasts and plans, that the Purchaser is familiar with such
uncertainties and that the Purchaser is taking full responsibility for making
its own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans so furnished to it, including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and
forecasts. Accordingly, the Purchaser hereby acknowledges that none of the
Seller (or any of its members), the Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of
their respective direct or indirect Affiliates or representatives (or any of
their directors, officers, employees, members, managers, partners or agents)
is making any representation or warranty with respect to such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, including the reasonableness of
the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections and forecasts. The
Purchaser further agrees that none of the Seller (or any of its members), the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective direct or indirect
Affiliates or representatives (or any of their directors, officers, employees,
members, managers, partners or agents), will have or be subject to any
Liability to the Purchaser or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to the Purchaser, or the Purchasers use of, any such
information, or any information, document or material made available to the
Purchaser or its Affiliates or their respective, counsel, accountants,
consultants, advisors, agents or other representatives or used in connection
with meetings between the Purchaser and the Company, in certain "data rooms"
and online "data sites," in management interviews, or in any other form in
expectation or anticipation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

7.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter,
including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
commitment for the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in
accordance with their respective terms, (ii) negotiate definitive agreements
with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter (including any "market flex" terms and conditions to which
the Debt Commitment Letter is subject), (iii) satisfy (and cause each of its
Affiliates to satisfy), or if deemed advisable by the Purchaser obtain the
waiver of, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to the Purchaser or
any of its Affiliates in the Debt Commitment Letter and the definitive
agreements related thereto (including payment of all fees and expenses) and
comply with its obligations thereunder and (iv) enforce its rights under the
Debt Financing in the event of 

 



49  any breach or purported breach thereof. In the event that all conditions to
the commitment of any counterparty to the Debt Commitment Letter providing the
Debt Financing (other than conditions that are within the control of the
Purchaser, including conditions relating to (1) the failure of any equity
funding condition of similar effect in the Debt Commitment Letter, (2) the
failure by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to deliver documents at the
Closing, (3) the failure to pay costs, fees, expenses or other compensation
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter to the lead arrangers, other
lenders and administrative agents or any other Person or (4) any breach, in
any material respect, by the Purchaser or any of its Affiliates under the Debt
Commitment Letter or related letters) have been satisfied, during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Purchaser
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders, and each other Person
providing the Debt Financing, to fund when required hereunder the Debt
Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
(including by taking enforcement action to cause such lenders and each such
other Person providing the Debt Financing to fund the Debt Financing). During
the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and
the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Purchaser
shall not and shall cause its Affiliates not to take or refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to
result in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter or in any definitive agreements related thereto.

(b) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Purchaser shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any provision
(including any remedy) under, or voluntarily replace the Debt Commitment
Letter if such amendment, modification, waiver or voluntary replacement (w)
adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions to the consummation
of the Debt Financing as compared to those in the Debt Commitment Letter as in
effect on the date of this Agreement if such amendments, modifications,
replacements, terminations or waivers could adversely affect the initial
amount or availability of the Debt Financing, (x) adversely affects the
ability of the Purchaser to enforce its rights against other parties to the
Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing, (y) reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing such that
the Purchaser would not have sufficient funds to pay the Purchase Price in
accordance with this Agreement or (z) could otherwise be expected to prevent,
impede or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

(c) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market
flex" terms and conditions to which the Debt Commitment Letter is subject),
or the Purchaser becomes aware of any event or circumstance that could
reasonably be expected to make any portion of the Debt Financing unavailable
on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any "market flex" terms and conditions to which the Debt Commitment
Letter is subject), regardless of the reason therefor, then the Purchaser
shall (1) use its reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in
replacement thereof, and to negotiate and enter into definitive agreements
with respect to,

 



50  alternative financing from alternative sources, in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to pay related fees and
expenses, with terms and conditions (including "market flex" terms and
conditions) not materially less favorable to the Purchaser than the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including any "market
flex" terms and conditions to which the Debt Commitment Letter is subject),
as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event, but in no
event later than the date on which the Purchaser is required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with this
Agreement, and (2) promptly notify the Company of such unavailability and the
reason therefor. For purposes of this Agreement, references to the "Debt
Financing" shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letter as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section
7.10(c)_, and references to the "Debt Commitment Letter" shall include such
documents as permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this  _Section
7.10(c)_.

(d) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the
Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms,
the Purchaser shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange and consummate the
Debt Financing. The Purchaser shall give the Company prompt written and
electronic notice of (x) any actual or threatened breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to the Debt Commitment Letter or definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing of which the Purchaser becomes aware,
(y) the receipt of any notice or other communication from any lender or other
Person providing the Debt Financing with respect to (I) any actual or
threatened breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to the
Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive document related to the Debt
Financing of any provisions of the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive
document related to the Debt Financing (or any statement by any such Person
that such Person does not intend to enter into any such document or to
consummate the transactions contemplated thereby) or (II) any material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or
any definitive document related to the Debt Financing, and (z) the occurrence
of any event or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely
impact the ability of the Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms
and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing
(or if at any time for any other reason the Purchaser believes that it will
not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions, in the manner or
from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the definitive
documents related to the Debt Financing). As soon as reasonably practicable
(and in any event within two (2) Business Days) after the date on which the
Company delivers to the Purchaser a written request, the Purchaser shall
provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating to any
circumstance referred to in the immediately preceding sentence.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.10_ or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to
the Closing or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that the
Purchaser obtain financing for or related to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



51 (e) The Sellers enforcement of any applicable Termination Fee provided for
in  _Section 8.02(b)_ against the Purchaser (if the Closing does not occur)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Affiliates
against the Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates for any and all
Losses, claims, expenses, Liabilities or damages suffered or incurred by the
Seller or any other Person in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, (and the termination thereof), the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby (and the abandonment or termination thereof)
or any matter forming the basis of such termination, the Seller shall not be
entitled to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding against
any Financing Sources arising out of or in connection with this Agreement,
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination
thereof), the Debt Commitment Letter or any matter forming the basis for such
termination and none of the Financing Sources shall have any further Liability
or obligation to the Seller relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the Debt Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
(or the abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis
for such termination upon payment of such amount; provided that nothing in
this Section 7.09(e) shall limit the right of any of the Seller, the Company,
its Subsidiaries and/or their respective representatives (x) to bring or
maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding against the Purchaser or any
Purchaser Party arising out of or in connection with any breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement or this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII or
(y) to be indemnified and reimbursed for expenses in accordance with _Section
6.02(c)_.

(f) The Company (on behalf of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives) hereby waives any rights or
claims against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing or in respect of any other document
or theory of law or equity (whether in tort, contract or otherwise) or in
respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith and the Company (on behalf of itself and any
of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives) agrees not to commence any Financing Source Proceeding
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the definitive financing agreements or
in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity and agrees to
cause any such Financing Source Proceeding asserted by the Company (on behalf
of itself and any of its Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents
and representatives) in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Debt Financing, the definitive financing agreements or in respect
of any other document or theory of law or equity against any Financing Source
to be dismissed or otherwise terminated. In furtherance and not in limitation
of the foregoing waiver, it is acknowledged and agreed that no Financing
Source shall have any Liability for any claims or damages to the Company and
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, agents and representatives in connection with this Agreement, the
Debt Commitment Letter, the Debt Financing, the definitive financing
agreements or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated and definitive financing agreements are entered into with any
Financing Source, this _Section 7.10(e)_ is not intended to release or waive
any claims that the Company and its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives may
have against any Financing Source under such applicable definitive financing
agreements.

 



52 (g) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that it will not bring (or
support any other person in bringing) any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description (including,
without limitation, any Financing Source Proceeding), whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter, the
Debt Financing, the definitive financing agreements, or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including, without limitation,
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the
performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the State of
New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and the appellate courts thereof) AND
THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12.11 RELATING TO THE WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL
SHALL APPLY TO ANY SUCH ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM OR THIRD
PARTY CLAIM.

liable for payment of the Termination Fee and other Liabilities as provided
in this _Section 8.02_.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by (i) the Seller in accordance with
_Section 8.01(f)_, (ii) the Purchaser at a time when the Seller may terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(f)_; or (iii) the Purchaser
and the Seller concurrently at a time when the Seller may terminate this
Agreement in accordance with _Section 8.01(f)_, then the Purchaser shall, as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business
Days after receipt of wire transfer instructions from the Seller) following
such termination, pay, (i) if such termination occurs prior to January 1,
2016, $40,000,000; and (ii) if such termination occurs on or after January 1,
2016, $50,000,000 (each of (i) and (ii), the " _Termination Fee_ ") to the
Seller (or its designee(s)) by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with the first sentence of
this  _Section 8.02(b)_ and the Seller (or its designee(s)) shall receive
full payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 8.02(b)_,
together with reimbursement of all applicable expenses and payment of all
applicable interest pursuant to this _Section 8.02(b)_, the receipt of the
Termination Fee, together with such expense reimbursement and interest, shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy against the Purchaser, any Purchaser Party or
any Financing Source for any and all Losses, claims, expenses, Liabilities or
damages suffered or incurred by the Seller or any other Person in connection
with this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter (and the termination thereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or termination
thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither the
Seller nor any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim,
suit, action or proceeding against the Purchaser or any Purchaser Party and,
without limiting _Section 7.10_, any Financing Sources arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment or termination thereof), any matter forming the basis for such
termination or in connection with the financing of any portion of the Debt
Financing, whether at law, in equity, in contracts, in tort or otherwise;
_provided_ that nothing in this _Section 8.02(b)_ shall limit the right of
any of the Seller, the Company, its Subsidiaries and/or their respective
representatives (x) to bring or maintain any claim, suit, action or proceeding
against the Purchaser or any Purchaser Party arising out of any breach of
the Confidentiality Agreement or (y) to be indemnified and reimbursed for
expenses in accordance with _Section 6.02(c)_. Each of the parties hereto
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section
8.02(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller acknowledge and
agree that (1) the Purchaser and the Seller have expressly negotiated the
provisions of this _Section 8.02(b)_, (2) in light of the circumstances
existing at the time of the execution of this Agreement (including the
inability of the parties hereto to quantify the damages that may be suffered
by the Seller) the provisions of

 



55  this _Section 8.02(b)_ are reasonable, (3) the Termination Fee represents a
good faith, fair estimate of the damages that the Seller would suffer as a
result of the termination of this Agreement and the failure of Purchaser to
acquire the equity of the Company from the Seller, and (4) the Termination Fee
shall be payable as liquidated damages (and not as a penalty) without
requiring the Seller or any other Person to prove actual damages. In the
event that the Purchaser shall fail to pay the Termination Fee when due, the
Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for all costs and expenses actually
incurred or accrued by the Seller, the Company or its Subsidiaries (including
fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with collection under and
enforcement in full of this _Section 8.02(b)_, together with interest on the
Termination Fee at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" at large U.S.
money center banks in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
(as published by _The Wall Street Journal_ ) through the date such payment was
actually received. In no event shall this _Section 8.02_ be construed
to mean that receipt of the Debt Financing is a condition to the Purchasers
obligations hereunder; rather, the Termination Fee shall be payable when
required in accordance with this Agreement regardless of whether or not the
Purchaser received the proceeds from the Debt Financing.

(c) Notwithstanding this _Section 8.02_ or anything else in this Agreement to
the contrary, the Purchaser affirms that it is not a condition to the Closing
or to any of its obligations under this Agreement that the Purchaser obtain
financing for or related to any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

ARTICLE 9

 

 _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS_

 

9.01 _Tax Matters_. The provisions of this _Section 9.01_ shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between the Purchaser, the Company and its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Seller, on the other hand, for certain
Tax matters following the Closing:

 

(a) _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. The Purchaser shall prepare and
timely file or cause to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns for the
Company and its Subsidiaries that have not yet been filed as of the Closing
Date. All such Tax Returns for periods ending on or before the Closing Date or
for any Straddle Period shall be prepared consistent with the past
procedures and practices and accounting methods of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, except as otherwise required by applicable law. The Purchaser
shall timely pay or cause to be timely paid any amount shown as due on such
Tax Returns.

 

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. Any stamp Tax, stock transfer Tax, or other similar Tax
imposed on the Company and its Subsidiaries or the Purchaser as a result of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, " _Transfer
Taxes_ "), and any penalties, interest or additions to Tax with respect to the
Transfer Taxes shall be paid by the Purchaser. The Purchaser shall be
responsible for filing any returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes and the
Seller agrees to cooperate with the Purchaser in the filing of any such
returns with respect to the Transfer Taxes, including promptly supplying
any information in its possession that is reasonably necessary to complete
such returns.

 



56 (c) _Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter_. The Purchaser shall not take any
action with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries that would cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to constitute part of a
transaction that is the same as, or substantially similar to, the
"Intermediary Transaction Tax Shelter" described in Internal Revenue Service
Notices 2001-16 and 2008-111.

_9.02 Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the terms of this Agreement
(including the limitations set forth in this _Section 9.02_), during the
period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of the Closing and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, each of
the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the conditions to the other parties obligations to
consummate the Closing to be satisfied and for the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable, and no party shall take any action designed to
prevent, impede or delay the Closing.

9.03 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each of the Purchaser and the Seller acknowledges that during the period
from the date of this Agreement to the Closing, it remains bound by the
confidentiality agreement, dated June 26, 2015 by and between the Purchaser
and H.D. Vest Financial Services, Inc. (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").
Additionally, the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive any termination of
this Agreement for a period of 24 months following the date of such
termination (and, notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement or the
Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, the Confidentiality Agreement term
shall be automatically amended to be extended accordingly); _provided_ that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser shall continue to remain subject
to the confidentiality and limitation of use provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement with respect to any retained Evaluation Material (as defined in the
Confidentiality Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement (prior to giving effect to any amendment by this _Section 9.03_).

 

(b) The Company and its Subsidiaries agree that all of the confidential
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries, including without limitation
processes, compositions, product specifications, past, current and planned
research and development, market studies and business plans, historical
financial statements, financial projections and budgets, historical and
projected sales, capital spending budgets and plans, contract terms, customer
and vendor terms, employee information, and any information that is marked
"confidential" or in some comparable manner, whether or not reduced to
writing, in each case of or concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries (the
" _Confidential Information_ "), immediately prior to the Closing, is the
sole, exclusive and valuable proprietary information and property of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, that such Confidential Information derives
independent economic value from not being readily known or ascertainable by
proper means by others who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or
use, and that upon the Closing such Confidential Information will remain the
sole and exclusive property of the Company and its Subsidiaries. Thus, the
Seller agrees that from and after the Closing Date, without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser, the Seller will (i) not use the
Confidential Information to the detriment of the Purchaser, the Company or
its Subsidiaries; and (ii) hold the Confidential Information in strict
confidence, and without limiting the foregoing, not disclose the
Confidential 

 



57  Information to any Person (other than the Purchaser or the Purchasers
Affiliates); provided, however, that the agreements in clause (ii) will not
apply to the extent that (A) the same information is currently publicly
available or becomes publicly available and that such public availability does
not result from the misappropriation or improper disclosure, directly or
indirectly, of such information by the Seller; (B) the Confidential
Information is required by applicable Law to be disclosed, but then only (1)
to the extent disclosure is required and (2) after undertaking in good faith
to give the Purchaser notice of such obligation so that it may seek a
protective order or other similar or appropriate relief or (C) the
Confidential Information is being disclosed solely as part of a proceeding
initiated with respect to the enforcement of Sellers rights hereunder or
under any agreement or transaction contemplated hereby.

9.04 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by any
party hereto and at such partys expense, any other party shall execute and
deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, all such documents and
instruments and shall take, or cause to be taken, all such further or other
actions as such requesting party may reasonably deem necessary or desirable
to evidence and effectuate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.05  _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. The Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its directors,
members, partners, officers, employees and Affiliates (individually and
collectively, the " _Purchaser Group_ "), that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (i) may
have served as counsel to the Seller and each of the Sellers members and
their respective Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "
_Seller Group_ ") and the Company, and (ii) may serve as counsel to the
Seller Group, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any successor) may serve as
counsel to the Seller Group or any director, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of the Seller Group, in connection with any matters
involving, including any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (a " _Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding such prior
representation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, and each of the parties
hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any claims they may have
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP has a conflict of interest arising therefrom or is
otherwise prohibited from engaging in a Post-Closing Representation, and each
of such parties shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to and waive any
such claim arising from such representation. The Purchaser further agrees, on
its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries following the Closing, that, in the event that a dispute arises
after the Closing between the Purchaser Group, the Company or a Subsidiary of
the Company and the Seller or its Affiliates, Kirkland and Ellis LLP may
represent Seller or its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests
of such Person(s) may be directly adverse to the Purchaser, the Company or a
Subsidiary of the Company and even though Kirkland and Ellis LLP may have
represented the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company in a matter
substantially related to such dispute. The Purchaser represents that the
Purchasers own attorney has explained and helped the Purchaser evaluate the
implications and risks of waiving the right to assert a future conflict
against Kirkland and Ellis LLP, and the Purchasers consent with respect to
this waiver is fully informed. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby
irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all

 



58  communications prior to the Closing between the Company and its Subsidiaries
and the Seller Group, on the one hand, and their external legal counsel,
including but not limited to Kirkland and Ellis LLP, on the other hand, made in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and
performance under, or any dispute or proceeding arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, any agreements contemplated by this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or any matter relating to any of
the foregoing (including, for the avoidance of doubt, all of the client files
and records in the possession of Kirkland and Ellis LLP related to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby), are privileged
communications between the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Seller Group and
such counsel (collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ ") and thereby
property of the Seller Group, and the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs to, and shall be controlled by, the
Seller and will not pass to or be claimed by the Purchaser, the Company or
any Subsidiary of the Company, and from and after the Closing none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries, or any Person purporting to act on behalf of or
through the Company or its Subsidiaries, will seek to obtain such
communications, whether by seeking a waiver of the attorney-client privilege
or through any other means. In addition, the Purchaser and the Company agree
that it would be impractical to remove all attorney-client communications from
the records (including e-mails and other electronic files) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Accordingly, as to any such Privileged Communications prior
to the Closing Date, the Purchaser, the Company, and each of its Subsidiaries
together with any of their respective Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or
assigns, further agree that no such Person may use or rely on any of the
Privileged Communications in a manner that may be adverse to the Seller or any
of its Affiliates.

 

9.06 _Press Releases and Communications_. No press release or public
announcement related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
herein, or prior to the Closing any other announcement or general
communication to the employees, customers or suppliers of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, shall be issued or made by any party hereto without the joint
approval of the Purchaser and the Seller, unless required by Law or the
applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Purchaser or its Affiliates
list securities (in each case, in the reasonable opinion of counsel), in which
case the Purchaser and the Seller shall have the right to review such press
release, announcement or communication prior to issuance, distribution or
publication, except to the extent such press release, announcement or
communication contains information substantially consistent with information
previously included in a press release, announcement or communication made in
accordance with this _Section 9.06_. Nothing herein shall prevent the Company
from notifying its and its Subsidiaries employees, customers or suppliers of
the transactions contemplated herein prior to the Closing as is necessary or
desirable to facilitate the consummation of such transactions. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that each of Parthenon
Capital (" _Parthenon_ "), Lovell Minnick Partners (" _Lovell Minnick_ "),
and Fisher Lynch Capital (" _Fisher Lynch_ ") and their respective Affiliates
(except for the Company and its Subsidiaries) may provide general information
about the subject matter of this Agreement in connection with Parthenons,
Lovell Minnicks or their respective Affiliates normal fund raising,
marketing, informational or reporting activities.

days following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
Company and the Purchaser shall file with the Federal Trade Commission (the "
_FTC_ ") and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_
") a Notification and Report Form relating to this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by the HSR Act, and
each of Company and/or Purchaser shall file comparable notification filings,
forms and submissions with any foreign Governmental Authority that may
be required by the notification or control laws and regulations (" _Antitrust
Laws_ ") of any foreign jurisdiction in which the Company or the Purchaser
have business or operations or in which the Company and the Purchaser mutually
agree to make such filing. Each of the Company and the Purchaser shall
promptly (i) cooperate and coordinate with the other in the making of such
filings, (ii) supply the other with any information that may be required in
order to effectuate such filings, and (iii) supply any additional information
that reasonably may be required or requested by the FTC, the DOJ or the
competition or other merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and

hte Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, each of the Company and the Purchaser shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, (i) promptly inform the other party hereto of any
communication from any Governmental Authority regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) if practicable, permit the other party
hereto an opportunity to review in advance all the information relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries or Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, as the case
may be, that appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted
to, any Person and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, without limitation,
in connection with obtaining the FINRA Approval), and incorporate the other
partys reasonable comments thereto, (iii) not participate in any substantive
meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation, or inquiry concerning this Agreement (including,
without limitation, in connection with obtaining the FINRA Approval) or the
transactions contemplated hereby unless such party consults with the other
party hereto in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, gives the other party hereto an opportunity to attend or
participate in such meeting or discussion, and (iv) furnish the other party
with copies of all correspondences, filings, and written communications
between them and their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the one hand, and
any Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the other hand, with
respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that as to each of (i) through (iv) above, (a) any materials
concerning valuation of the transaction or internal financial information may
be redacted, and (b) each of Company and Purchaser may, as each deem
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other under this _Section 9.07_ as "counsel only"
and, in such event, such material and the information contained therein shall
be given only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and shall not be
disclosed by such counsel to non-legal directors, officers, employees or other
advisors or representatives of the recipient unless prior consent is obtained
in advance from the source of the materials or its legal counsel.

 



60 (c) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, either the Company or the Purchaser or either of their respective
Affiliates receives a request for additional information or documentary
material from any such Governmental Authority or by the other party to this
Agreement in connection with a request from such Governmental Authority, in
each case with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including without limitation in connection with obtaining the
FINRA Approval), then such party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable and after
consultation with the other party, an appropriate response in compliance with
such request.

 

(d) If, during the period from the date of this Agreement to the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, any administrative or judicial action or proceeding, including any
proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as violative of
any Law or Order, or if any Law or Order is enacted, entered, promulgated or
enforced by a Governmental Authority which would make illegal, or would
otherwise prohibit or materially impair or delay, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and the Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates to, cooperate in all respects with each other
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to contest such action or
proceeding and have vacated or otherwise lifted any such Law or Order,
provided however that nothing in this _Section 9.07_ requires the Company or
the Purchaser to (i) agree to or effectuate any sale, divestiture, license or
other disposition or holding separate of any assets or categories of assets,
or (ii) agree to any material restriction on its business or the imposition of
any material limitation or regulation on the ability of the Company and the
Purchaser or their respective Subsidiaries to freely conduct their
respective businesses.

9.08 _Guarantee_.

 

(a) The Parent (i) shall cause the Purchaser to fulfill and comply with all of
its obligations under this Agreement, (ii) absolutely, unconditionally and
irrevocably guarantees, as a principal and primary obligor and not as a
surety, to the Seller and the Company the due and timely performance by the
Purchaser of the Purchasers covenants, agreements, obligations, commitments
and undertakings given or undertaken or expressed to be given or undertaken
under this Agreement which are to be performed on or prior to the Closing
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the payment of the Purchase Price).

(b) The guarantee in this _Section 9.08_ is a guarantee of payment and
performance, and not merely of collection, and the Parent acknowledges and
agrees that no release or extinguishments of the Purchasers obligations or
Liabilities (other than in accordance with the terms of this Agreement),
whether by decree in any bankruptcy proceeding or otherwise, shall affect the
continuing validity and enforceability of this guarantee.

(c) The Parent hereby waives, for the benefit of the Seller and the Company,
any right to require the Seller or the Company, as a condition of payment or
performance by the Parent, to proceed against the Parent or pursue any other
remedies whatsoever. Parent further waives any and all defenses it may have to
the enforceability of this guaranty against it solely as

 



61  a guarantor, which waiver shall not affect any defenses Purchaser may have
as an obligor with respect thereto. Parent hereby represents and warrants to
the Seller and the Company that (i) it is a corporation duly formed, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware, and it
has all power and authority to execute, deliver and perform its obligations
under this _Section 9.08_; (ii) the execution, delivery and performance of
this Agreement by it has been duly and validly authorized and approved by all
necessary corporate action on its part, and no other proceedings or actions on
the part of it are necessary therefor; (iii) this Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by it and assuming that this Agreement is a
valid and binding obligation of the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid
and legally binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance
with its terms, and (v) assuming the funding in full of the Debt Financing in
accordance with the Debt Commitment Letter, it has, and will have at the
Closing, sufficient funds immediately available to pay and perform all of its
obligations under this Section 9.08. The parties acknowledge and agree that
obligations of the Parent hereunder are independent of the obligations of the
Purchaser and that a separate action may be brought against the Parent,
whether or not such action is brought against the Purchaser or whether the
Purchaser is joined in such action. The Parent hereby agrees that its
Liability hereunder shall not be contingent upon the exercise or enforcement
by the Seller or the Company of whatever remedies they may have against the
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

9.09 _Rollover_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each of the Company and the Seller agree to take all
necessary steps to comply with its obligations set forth in the Rollover
Agreements, including the distribution of Company Shares (as defined in the
Rollover Agreement) to Roger Ochs and the Rollover Employees as contemplated
by and pursuant to the Rollover Agreement.

 

(b) In accordance with the Rollover Agreements, in the event that any Rollover
Agreement has been terminated or is no longer in effect, the Company and the
Seller shall refrain from distributing any Shares to such employee previously
subject to such terminated or ineffective Rollover Agreement and to the extent
any such Shares were distributed to any such employee prior to
the termination of the applicable Rollover Agreement, the Company and the
Seller agree to take such steps as are necessary or appropriate to ensure that
such Shares are held by the Seller at the Closing.

any matter arising under a provision of this Agreement to the extent that the
Indemnified Party has already recovered Losses with respect to such matter

regard and without giving effect to "materiality," "material adverse effect"
or similar qualifiers.

 

(h) Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses after becoming aware of any event
which could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are
indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith.

 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article 10_ , in no

decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (c) by any other means to

or accurate notice as provided in this _Article 10_ will not affect the rights

vis its rights and obligations hereunder.

the avoidance of doubt, by a Governmental Authority) with respect to (i) any

matters involving a monetary or other obligation, in each case, which may, if
true, constitute or result in Losses for which an Indemnifying Party is
obligated to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Indemnified
Party pursuant to this _Article 10_ (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall notify
the Indemnifying Party of its existence setting forth with reasonable
specificity the facts and circumstances of which such Indemnified Party has
received notice, the amount of Losses being claimed, to the extent known, and
specifying the basis hereunder upon which the Indemnified Partys claim for
indemnification is asserted. A failure by an Indemnified Party to give timely,
complete or accurate notice of a Third Party Claim will not affect the rights
or obligations of any party hereunder except and only to the extent that, as a
result of such failure, any party entitled to receive such notice was damaged
or prejudiced as a result of such failure to give timely notice vis-a-vis its
rights and obligations hereunder.

 



65 (b) Subject to _Section 10.06(e)_ and only to the extent permitted by
applicable Law (or by the applicable Governmental Authority bringing the
action, claim, examination, investigation, enforcement referral or audit), the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to conduct and control at its own
expense, through counsel of its choosing, the defense of any Third Party
Claim as to which indemnification is sought by any Indemnified Party from any
Indemnifying Party hereunder; provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party
shall not have the right to conduct and control the defense of such Third
Party Claim if the insurer under the RandW Insurance Policy has assumed the
defense of such Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms of the RandW
Insurance Policy. The Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party
in writing, as promptly as possible (but in any case before the due date for
the answer or response to the Third Party Claim if such notice is given at
least ten days prior to such due date) after receipt of the notice of Third
Party Claim given by the Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party under
_Section 10.06(a)_ of its election to assume the defense of such Third Party
Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing procedures (but subject to _Sections
10.06(d) and 10.06(e))_, the Seller, as the Indemnifying Party for any
matter set forth on the Specified Indemnity Schedule that is being actively
managed and subject to current, ongoing and continuing discussions with the
relevant counterparty as of the Closing Date, shall be able to assume the
defense of any such ongoing matters by providing the Purchaser, as the
Indemnified Party, of notice of its intent to assume such defense no later
than thirty (30) days following the Closing Date. The Indemnified Party has
the right, but not the obligation to participate, through separate counsel
chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third Party
Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party has so elected to conduct
and control the defense thereof.

(c) With respect to any Third Party Claim as to which the Indemnifying Party
has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof, the Indemnifying
Party shall give the Indemnified Party written notice of the Indemnifying
Partys intention to settle any Third Party Claim at least 10 days prior to
the settlement of any such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall
not settle or compromise such Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
unless (i) the Indemnified Party is given a full and complete release of any
and all Liability by all relevant parties to such claim or demand in respect
of such Third Party Claim; (ii) the damages payable under the settlement are
limited to monetary payments for which the Indemnified Party is
fully indemnified by the Indemnifying Party; (iii) the settlement does not
require any non-monetary relief; and (iv) the settlement does not act as an
adverse and binding precedent upon the Indemnified Party with respect to any
unrelated similar claims or demands, as reasonably determined based upon the
advice of outside counsel. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 10.06_
to the contrary, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay, settle or
compromise any Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys consent,
provided, that, in such event the Indemnified Party shall waive any right to
indemnity therefor hereunder.

 



66 (d) To the extent any Governmental Authority does not permit the Indemnifying
Party to conduct and control the defense of any Third Party Claim in
accordance with _Section 10.06(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall conduct and
control, through counsel of the Indemnifying Partys choosing which is
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party, the defense, compromise and
settlement of any such Third Party Claim; provided that if the Indemnified
Party shall comply with _Section 10.06(f)_ with respect to the ongoing
defense of such Third Party Claim and in the event the Indemnified Party
intends to settle such Third Party Claim and is seeking or intends to seek
indemnification from the Seller under this Article 10 with respect to any
Losses caused by, arising out of, resulting from or attributable to
such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party written notice of the Indemnified Partys intention to settle at least
20 days prior to the settlement of any such Third Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party shall not settle or compromise such Third Party Claim
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.06(b)_ to the contrary, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control, through
counsel of its choosing, the defense, compromise and settlement of any Third
Party Claim that (i) seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against the
Indemnified Party; (ii) relates to Taxes imposed on the Company or any
Subsidiaries or that involves the Tax Returns of the Company or any
Subsidiary; or (iii) the settlement of which may act as an adverse and binding
precedent upon the Indemnified Party with respect to unrelated similar claims
or demands, as reasonably determined based upon the advice of outside
counsel. Additionally, the Indemnifying Party shall lose its right to contest,
defend, litigate and settle the Third Party Claim if it shall fail to accept a
tender of the defense of the Third Party Claim in the manner set forth herein
or if it shall fail to diligently manage the Third Party Claim in the
reasonable judgment of the Indemnified Party based upon the advice of outside
counsel. In any such event described in this  _Section 10.06(d)_, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to conduct and control, through counsel
of its choosing, the defense, compromise or settlement of any such Third Party
Claim.

 

(f) With respect to any Third Party Claim, the party conducting and
controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, (i) promptly inform the other party hereto of material
communications from any Governmental Authority regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) if practicable, permit the other party
hereto an opportunity to review in advance all the information that appears
in any material filing made with, or material written materials submitted to,
any Person and/or any Governmental Authority in connection with a Third Party
Claim, and incorporate such other partys reasonable and prompt comments
thereto, (iii) not participate in any substantive settlement meeting or other
material discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filing,
investigation, or inquiry concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries unless
the party conducting and controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim
consults with the other party hereto in advance, and, to the extent permitted
by such Governmental Authority, gives such other party hereto an opportunity
to attend or participate in such settlement meeting or other material
discussion, and (iv) furnish the other party with copies of all material
correspondences, filings, and written communications between any
Governmental Authority or its respective staff, on the one hand, and the
party conducting and controlling the defense of such Third Party Claim and
their Subsidiaries and Representatives, on the other with respect to such
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that with respect to any Third Party
Claim for which the Seller is conducting and controlling the defense thereof,
any references to "material" in items (i) through (iv) in this

 



67   _Section 10.06(f)_ shall be disregarded for purposes of this covenant.
Further, the parties hereto agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate in the defense of any Third Party Claim, including by retaining and
upon the request of the party conducting and controlling the defense of such
Third Party Claim, providing to such party all material records and
information which are reasonably relevant to such Third Party Claim, and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The
parties hereby agree to enter into a customary nondisclosure agreement with
respect to any Third Party Claim, including the existence of such Third Party
Claim and any information provided by the Purchaser, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with a Third Party Claim.

 

10.07 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of actual fraud by the Seller,
from and after the Closing, the remedies provided in this  _Article 10_ shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of the parties in connection with any
breach of representations or warranties or non-performance of any covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement; provided, however, that
nothing contained herein shall prevent any party from seeking specific
performance or injunctive relief to which it is entitled pursuant to _Section
12.17_ with respect to any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement.

12.17 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Subject to _Sections 8.02(b) and 12.17(b)_ , the parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary relief, even if available, would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that any provision of this
Agreement is not performed in accordance with its specific terms or is
otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any
action required of them hereunder to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to _Sections 8.02(b)
and 12.17(b)_ , (i) the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions, specific performance or other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in the courts described in _Section 12.16_ without proof of
damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the parties hereto agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific performance or other equitable relief is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or inequitable for any reason, and
not to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate
remedy or that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law, and (iii)
any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 12.17_ shall not be required to
provide any bond or other security in connection with any such order
or injunction. If, on or prior to the End Date, any party hereto brings any
action, in each case in accordance with _Section 12.16_ and subject to
_Section 12.17(b)_, to enforce specifically the performance of the terms
and provisions hereof by any other party, the End Date shall automatically be
extended (x) for the period during which such action is pending, plus ten (10)
Business Days or (y) by such other time period established by the court
presiding over such action, as the case may be. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event shall this _Section 12.17_ be used, alone
or together with any other provision of this Agreement, to require the Company
to remedy any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company made
herein.

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, including the provisions
of _Section 12.17(a)_, prior to the Closing, the right of the Seller or the
Company to obtain an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief, with respect to the obligation of the Purchaser to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall only be available in
the event that: (i) all conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 2.01_
have been satisfied or waived at the time when the Closing would have
occurred pursuant to the terms hereof (other than those conditions which by
their terms or nature are to be satisfied by performance at the Closing,
provided that such conditions would be satisfied at the Closing); (ii) the
Debt Financing has been funded, or will be funded at the Closing subject to
satisfaction of any equity funding condition in the Debt Commitment Letter;
and (iii) the Seller has confirmed in a written notice to the Purchaser that:
(A) all conditions to the Closing set forth in _Section 2.02_ have been
satisfied or that the Seller and the Company are willing to waive any
unsatisfied conditions (other than those conditions which by their terms or
nature are to be satisfied by performance at the Closing, _provided_ that
such conditions would be satisfied at the Closing), and

 



86  (B) if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is funded,
then the Seller and the Company are ready, willing and able to consummate the
Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and the Company may pursue a
grant of specific performance as expressly permitted by this _Section
12.17(b)_ or the payment of the Termination Fee (and any related costs of
collection or interest payment) by the Purchaser, but under no circumstances
shall the Purchaser be obligated to both specifically perform the terms of
this Agreement and pay the Termination Fee (and any related costs of
collection or interest payment) in accordance with _Section 8.02(b)_. 

12.18 _Consents_. The Purchaser acknowledges that certain consents to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties to
contracts, leases, licenses or other agreements to which the Company and/or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party (including the contracts set forth on the
_Contracts Schedule_ and the Real Property Leases set forth on the  _Real
Property Schedule_ ) and such consents may not have been obtained. The
Purchaser agrees and acknowledges that the Seller and the Company shall have
no liability whatsoever to the Purchaser (and the Purchaser shall not be
entitled to assert any claims) arising solely out of the failure to obtain
any consents that were set forth on the _Company Authorization Schedule_ or
the _Seller Authorization Schedule_ or because of the default, acceleration or
termination of any such contract, lease, license or other agreement as a
direct result of the failure to obtain any consents set forth on the _Company
Authorization Schedule_ or the _Seller Authorization Schedule_.

 

12.19 _Seller Reserve_. Prior to any distribution by the Seller to its members
of any amounts received by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement, the Seller
may, in its discretion, retain a portion of such amounts to be held in reserve
by the Seller to pay for potential post-Closing expenses incurred by the
Seller in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transaction contemplated hereby or thereby; provided that the Seller agrees
to indemnify, defend, protect and hold harmless the Purchaser Indemnitees
solely with respect to any claims by Sellers equityholders related to
Sellers failure to distribute such amounts to Sellers equityholders.
