AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") dated as of May 28, 2013,
among FIDELITY NATIONAL FINANCIAL, INC., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"),
LION MERGER SUB, INC., a Delaware corporation and a Subsidiary of Parent
("Sub"), and LENDER PROCESSING SERVICES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the
"Company").

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and Sub has unanimously
approved and declared advisable, and the Board of Directors of Parent has
unanimously approved, this Agreement and the merger of Sub with and into the
Company (the "Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock,
par value $0.0001 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock"), other
than (a) shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by the Company, as
treasury stock, or by Parent or Sub, (b) shares of Company Common Stock owned
directly by any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and (c) the Appraisal
Shares, will be converted into the right to receive $16.625 in cash and
0.65224 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Parent
("Parent Common Stock");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Parent has unanimously adopted resolutions
approving this Agreement, the Merger, the other Merger Transactions and the
Parent Share Issuance, and resolved to recommend that the stockholders of
Parent approve the Parent Share Issuance (to the extent such approval is
required under applicable Law);

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to
prescribe various conditions to the Merger; and

WHEREAS, Parent, Sub and the Company intend that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the receipt of the Merger Consideration in exchange for shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger be a fully taxable transaction to
the holders of shares of Company Common Stock.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

The Merger

SECTION 1.01. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation in the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation").

SECTION 1.02. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take
place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second business day after
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set
forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), at the offices of Cravath,
Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York
10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by Parent
and the Company; provided that, notwithstanding the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, if
the Marketing Period has not ended at the time of the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of such conditions (other than those
conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject
to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those
conditions), the Closing shall occur instead on (i) the date following the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions that is the earliest to occur of (A)
any business day during the Marketing Period specified by Parent to the
Company on no less than two business days\' written notice to the Company and
(B) the first business day immediately following the final day of the
Marketing Period or (ii) such other date, time or place as agreed to in
writing by Parent, Sub and the Company. Parent and Sub acknowledge and agree
that the receipt of the Financing is not a condition to Closing and that the
failure to obtain the Financing shall not in any way relieve Parent or Sub of
their obligations to close the Merger on the Closing Date. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date".

SECTION 1.03. Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, Parent, Sub and the Company shall
file a certificate of merger (the "Certificate of Merger") in such form as is
required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings and recordings
required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and
time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware in accordance with the DGCL or at such subsequent date and
time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of
Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to
in this Agreement as the "Effective Time".

SECTION 1.04. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

SECTION 1.05. Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. The certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended at the
Effective Time to be the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Sub as in
effect immediately 

prior to the Effective Time (except as to the name of the Surviving
Corporation, which shall be Lender Processing Services, Inc.) until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

SECTION 1.06. Directors. The directors of Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

SECTION 1.07. Officers. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

ARTICLE II

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the

Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;

Company Equity Awards

SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Sub or the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of
Parent or Sub:

(a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each share of capital stock of Sub issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, as treasury stock,
or by Parent or Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding
shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b), shares to remain
outstanding in accordance with Section 2.01(e), and, except as provided in
Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to
receive (i) $16.625 in cash, without interest (the "Initial Cash
Consideration" and, as the same may be increased pursuant to Section 2.01(g),
the "Cash Consideration") and (ii) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non assessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Exchange Ratio as
determined pursuant to Section 2.01(h) (the "Stock Consideration" and,
together with the Cash Consideration, the "Merger Consideration"). At the
Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company
Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any
declared dividends on the Company Common Stock with a record date prior to the
Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to
such holder, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to 2.02(j)
and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(i),
without interest, in each case to be issued or paid in consideration therefor
upon surrender of the applicable Certificate in accordance with Section
2.02(b), in the case of certificated shares, and automatically, in the case of
book-entry shares.

(d) Appraisal Rights. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the "Appraisal Shares") of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any
holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares
pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section
262 of the DGCL ("Section 262") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead
such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive any
dividends in accordance with Section 2.02(j) and the right to receive the fair
value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect
or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under
Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder\'s Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c),
without any interest thereon. The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent
of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company, and Parent shall have the right to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent 

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

(e) Common Stock Owned by Subsidiaries of the Company. Each share of Company
Common Stock held by any Subsidiary of the Company shall be converted into a
number of shares of stock of the Surviving Corporation such that each such
Subsidiary owns the same percentage of the common stock of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time as such Subsidiary owned
in Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(f) Adjustments to Exchange Ratio. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted
to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities of a
Subsidiary of Parent or the Company or of securities convertible into Parent
Common Stock or Company Common Stock), extraordinary cash dividends,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock with a record date occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

(g) Adjustments to the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration.

(i) Subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
2.01(g)(ii), Parent shall have the option, by notice in writing to the Company
on or before the Adjustment Determination Date (such notice, the "Adjustment
Notice"), to increase the Cash Consideration by an amount up to the amount of
the Initial Cash Consideration (the amount by which Parent elects to increase
the Cash Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.01(g)(i), the "Increased
Cash Consideration"). The Adjustment Notice shall include, on a per share of
Company Common Stock basis, the amount of the Increased Cash Consideration,
Parent\'s calculation of the Exchange Ratio (as of the date of the Adjustment
Notice) and evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company that the
conditions set forth in Section 2.01(g)(ii) have been satisfied. The
Adjustment Notice shall be accompanied by a certificate signed on behalf of
Parent by an executive officer thereof to the effect that the conditions set
forth in Section 2.01(g)(ii) have been satisfied.

(ii) The ability of Parent to increase the Cash Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.01(g)(i), will be subject to the satisfaction of either of the
following conditions:

(A)(1) Parent shall have delivered to the Company true and complete copies of
one or more commitment letters and any related documents or agreements from
reputable financial institutions or other persons, in each case reasonably
acceptable to the Company, to provide, subject to the terms and conditions
therein (which shall not contain additional or adversely modified conditions
or other contingencies to the availability of the Additional Financing
relative to those contained in the applicable Initial Financing Commitments as
of the date of this Agreement (or solely with respect to any revolving
commitments, any additional or adversely modified conditions or other
contingencies to the availability of such financing on the Closing Date than
those contained in the Existing Facility as of the date of this Agreement or
the Initial Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement) and shall
otherwise be no less favorable to Parent and the Company, when taken as a
whole, than the terms and conditions of the applicable Initial Financing
Commitments (or solely with respect to any revolving commitments, than the
terms of the Existing Facility as of the date of this Agreement or the Initial
Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement)), debt or equity
financing (the "Additional Financing") in an aggregate amount at least equal
to the aggregate Increased Cash Consideration (the "Additional Financing
Commitments"), (2) Parent or Sub shall have fully paid any and all commitment
fees or other fees in connection with the such financing commitments that are
payable on or prior to the date of the Adjustment Notice and (3) the
representations and warranties of Parent and Sub with respect to the
Additional Financing and the Additional Financing Commitments set forth in
Section 3.02(g) shall be true and correct in all material respects; or

(B)Parent either shall have (1) received financing (other than the Initial
Financing) after the date of this Agreement and on or before the date of the
Adjustment Notice in an aggregate amount at least equal to the aggregate
Increased Cash Consideration, the proceeds of which financing shall have been
deposited in an escrow account or other segregated account on terms (including
with respect to withdrawals, use of proceeds, distributions and investments),
and subject to appropriate documentation, reasonably satisfactory to the
Company or (2) cash on hand in readily available funds in an aggregate amount
at least equal to the aggregate Increased Cash Consideration, and evidence of
such funds shall have been provided to the Company in a form reasonably
satisfactory to the Company.

(h) Exchange Ratio. "Exchange Ratio" means the Initial Exchange Ratio, subject
to adjustment as set forth below (in each case rounded to the nearest hundred-
thousandth): 

(i) if the Increased Cash Consideration is zero and the Average Parent Stock
Price is an amount less than the Floor Price, then the Exchange Ratio shall be
an amount equal to the quotient of (x) the Initial Stock Floor Value divided
by (y) the greater of the Average Parent Stock Price and the Lower Floor
Price;

(ii) if the Increased Cash Consideration is greater than zero and:

(A)if the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than the Ceiling
Price, then the Exchange Ratio shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (a)
(x) the product of (1) the Initial Exchange Ratio multiplied by (2) the
Average Parent Stock Price minus (y) the Increased Cash Consideration divided
by (b) the Average Parent Stock Price;

(B)if the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount greater than or equal to the
Floor Price but less than or equal to the Ceiling Price, then the Exchange
Ratio shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (a) (x) the Initial Stock
Value minus (y) the Increased Cash Consideration divided by (b) the Reference
Price; or

(C)if the Average Parent Stock Price is an amount less than the Floor Price,
then the Exchange Ratio shall be an amount equal to the quotient of (a) the
New Stock Floor Value divided by (b) the greater of the Average Parent Stock
Price and the Lower Floor Price.

SECTION 2.02. Exchange Fund. (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Closing Date,
Parent shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the
Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the payment of the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II and, in connection
therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Exchange Agent in the form
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agency Agreement"). At or
prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause Sub to
deposit, with the Exchange Agent (i) book-entry shares representing the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate Stock
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (ii) cash in an amount sufficient
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and (iii)
cash in an amount sufficient to make all requisite payments of cash in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(i). In addition, Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, as necessary from time to time on or after
the Effective Time, an amount in cash sufficient to pay any dividends or other
distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or Section 2.02(j). The
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent are
referred to in this Agreement as the "Exchange Fund".

(b) Certificate Exchange Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time, but in any event within two business days thereafter, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and which
shall otherwise be in customary form (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent\'s message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of
record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such
Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other customary documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash in the amount equal to the
Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) and this Article II, book-entry shares representing the Stock
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.01(c) and this Article II, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(i)
and any dividends or other distributions such holder is entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or Section 2.02(j), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any
fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender cash in the amount equal to the Cash Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this
Article II, book-entry shares representing the Stock Consideration that such
holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and this Article
II, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(i) and any dividends or other
distributions such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c)
and/or Section 2.02(j). No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash
payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article
II.

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration, any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
Section 2.01(c) and/or Section 2.02(j) and cash in lieu of any fractional
shares payable pursuant to Section 2.02(i) paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such 

Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation\'s obligation to
pay all declared dividends with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on
which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving
Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of the Merger
Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or Section 2.02(j) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.02(i)) to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II.

(d) Termination of the Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12 months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holders
of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to Parent and the Surviving Corporation for, and
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their
claims for the Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions
payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or Section
2.02(j) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto
pursuant to Section 2.02(i)) pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any shares
of Parent Common Stock, cash, dividends or other distributions from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable
state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the
related Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other distributions payable
with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or Section 2.02(j) and
cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 2.02(i)) would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Entity, any such Merger Consideration (and any dividends or other
distributions payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or
Section 2.02(j) and cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.02(i)) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of Parent,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled
thereto.

(f) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash in
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; provided, however, that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith
and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A‑1 or P‑1 or better by Moody\'s Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poor\'s Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker\'s acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements
of such bank that are then publicly available) and, in any such case, no
instrument or investment shall have a maturity exceeding three months. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely
to Parent. To the extent there are losses with respect to such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall or shall cause Sub to promptly replace
or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so that the Exchange Fund is at all
times maintained at a level sufficient for the Exchange Agent to fully satisfy
such cash payment obligations. Nothing contained herein and no investment
losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the
rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration as
provided herein.

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such reasonable amount as
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions payable with respect
thereto pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and/or Section 2.02(j) and cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable with respect thereto pursuant to Section
2.02(i).

(h) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Restricted Stock or any holder of a Company
Stock Option or Company Performance Based Retention Incentive Award or any
participant in the Company ESPP such amounts as Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law.
For the avoidance of doubt, withholding with respect to the total amount of
consideration paid hereunder may be made (x) from the Cash Consideration or
(y) in part from the Cash Consideration and in part from the Stock
Consideration (valuing the Parent Common Stock based on the Average Parent
Stock Price); provided, however, that to the extent withholding is done in
part from the Cash Consideration and in part from the Stock Consideration, the
withholding shall be done ratably from the Cash Consideration and the Stock
Consideration, except as required by applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as 

having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, the
holder of shares of Company Restricted Stock or the holder of the Company
Stock Option or the holder of the Company Performance Based Retention
Incentive Award or the participant in the Company ESPP, as the case may be, in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent.

(i) No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares or book-entry credit of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or upon the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock in book-entry form, no dividends or other distributions
of Parent shall relate to such fractional share interests and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights
of a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise
would have been entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock shall
receive in lieu thereof cash (rounded to the nearest cent) equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (A) the fractional share interest to which
such holder (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by all Certificates surrendered by such holder and all
shares of Company Common Stock in book-entry form formerly held by such holder
that are converted) would otherwise be entitled by (B) Average Parent Stock
Price. The parties hereto acknowledge that payment of the cash consideration
in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for
consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of
avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be
caused by the issuance of fractional shares.

(j) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares of Parent Common Stock.
(i) No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent
Common Stock that the holder thereof has the right to receive upon the
surrender thereof, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.02(i), in
each case until the holder of such Certificate shall have surrendered such
Certificate in accordance with this Article II. Following the surrender of any
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificate
representing shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, (A) at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends
or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(i) and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Parent
Common Stock.

(ii) Holders of shares of Company Common Stock in book-entry form who are
entitled to receive shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid (A) at the
time of payment of such Parent Common Stock, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and the amount of any
cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.02(i) and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to the time of such payment of Parent
Common Stock and a payment date subsequent to the time of such payment payable
with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

(k) Uncertificated Shares. In the case of any outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock that are not represented by Certificates, the parties shall make
such adjustments to this Section 2.02 as are necessary or appropriate to
implement the same purpose and effect that this Section 2.02 has with respect
to shares of Company Common Stock that are represented by Certificates.

SECTION 2.03. Company Equity Awards. (a) As soon as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall
adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
provide that:

(i)unless otherwise agreed between the applicable holder and Parent and with
the prior written consent of the Company, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each unexercised Company Stock Option that is outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be
net exercised for that number of whole and fractional shares of Company Common
Stock, with such whole shares being treated as issued and outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement (including Section 2.01(c)) and such fractional
shares being paid to the holder in cash (based on the Fair Market Value (as
such term is defined in the Company\'s 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan) of Company
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), equal to (A) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (B) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock with a Fair Market Value (as such term is defined in the
Company\'s 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan) as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time equal to the sum of (I) the aggregate exercise price of such
Company Stock Option and (II) any taxes required to be deducted and withheld
under the Code and other applicable Laws in connection with such settlement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Company Stock Options that have a per share
exercise price 

that is equal to or greater than the Fair Market Value (as such term is
defined in the Company\'s 2008 Omnibus Incentive Plan) of a share of Company
Common Stock as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled
and terminated without consideration as of the Effective Time. For the
avoidance of doubt, any consideration payable with respect to Company Stock
Options and the shares of Company Common Stock issued in respect thereof
pursuant to this Section 2.03(a)(i) (the "Option Amount") shall be paid out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest; and

(ii)unless otherwise agreed between the applicable holder and Parent and with
the prior written consent of the Company, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, each share of Company Restricted Stock that is then outstanding shall
vest in full and become free of restrictions as of the Effective Time
(assuming, in the case of any such share of Company Restricted Stock that is
subject to performance-based vesting (other than those referred to in the last
sentence of this Section 2.03(a)(ii)), attainment of all applicable
performance goals at the target goal) and, at the Effective Time, shall be
canceled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the
"Restricted Stock Consideration") in accordance with Section 2.01(c). For the
avoidance of doubt, the Restricted Stock Consideration shall be paid out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest, and, any
dividends accrued pursuant to the terms of any such share of Company
Restricted Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
and that are unpaid as of the Effective Time shall be paid in cash, without
interest, by the Company to the holder thereof as promptly as practicable
following, but in no event later than ten business days after, the Effective
Time in accordance with the Company\'s payroll procedures. For the avoidance
of doubt, no Restricted Stock Consideration shall be payable with respect to
Company Restricted Stock subject to performance-based vesting and with respect
to which the applicable performance period shall have ended prior to, and
without regard to the occurrence of, the Effective Time without attainment of
applicable performance goals, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock
shall be forfeited without consideration immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

(b) With respect to the ESPP, each participant\'s accumulated Participant
Contributions and Matching Contributions (as such terms are defined in the
ESPP, and including all Matching Contributions that are payable with respect
to Participant Contributions made prior to the Effective Time and that would
otherwise have been credited to such participant\'s Account (as such term is
defined in the ESPP) following the Effective Time based on such participant\'s
continued employment following the Effective Time (such Matching
Contributions, the "Designated Matching Contributions")) shall be treated as
follows: (i) all Participant Contributions and Matching Contributions (other
than Designated Matching Contributions) shall be used to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance
with the terms of the ESPP, and the shares of Company Common Stock purchased
thereunder shall be canceled at the Effective Time and converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (which
shall be paid out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with Section 2.02,
without interest) and (ii) all Designated Matching Contributions shall, to the
extent that shares of Company Common Stock have not been purchased with
respect thereto prior to the Effective Time, be paid to the participant in
cash as promptly as practicable following, but in no event later than ten
business days after, the Effective Time, without interest, and Parent shall
cause the payments in respect of Designated Matching Contributions to be made
by the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the Company\'s payroll
procedures. The Company shall cause the ESPP to terminate at the Effective
Time, and, effective immediately following the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time and (ii) the first Quarter End (as such term is defined in the ESPP)
immediately following the date hereof, all Participation Contributions shall
cease and no further purchase rights (other than accrued Matching
Contributions) shall be (x) granted or (y) permitted to be exercised under the
ESPP thereafter; provided, that any amounts credited to a participant\'s
Account as of immediately prior to the Effective Time that are insufficient to
purchase a whole share of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be distributed in cash to such participant as promptly as
practicable following, but in no event later than ten business days after, the
Effective Time. Further, the Company shall amend the Company ESPP to provide
that as of the date hereof no participant may elect to increase his or her
rate of Participant Contributions and no additional employees may become
participants in the Company ESPP. As of the date hereof, the Company has
suspended all Matching Contributions under the ESPP and, prior to the
Effective Time without the prior written consent of Parent, the Company agrees
not to reinstate any Matching Contributions under the ESPP.

(c) Unless otherwise paid in accordance with its terms prior to the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Performance-Based Retention Incentive Award (as
set forth in Section 2.03(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter) shall,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, vest in full and become free of
restrictions and, at the Effective Time, each such Company Performance-Based
Retention Incentive Award shall be canceled and the holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive a cash payment equal to the amount payable in respect
thereof based on attainment of the applicable Performance Objective (as such
term is defined in the applicable award agreement) at maximum level (the
"Retention Incentive Award Consideration"), provided, that the Retention
Incentive Award Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable
following, but in no event later than ten business days after, the Effective
Time, without interest, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
make such payments in accordance with the Company\'s payroll procedures.

"Company Filed SEC Documents") (excluding any risk factor disclosures and
other forward looking statements, in each case that are not statements of
historical fact) or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter (it
being understood that any information set forth in one Section or subsection
of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the
Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it corresponds in number and
each other Section or subsection of this Agreement to the extent that it is
reasonably apparent in light of the context and content of the disclosure that
such information is relevant to such other Section or subsection), the Company
represents and warrants to Parent and Sub as follows:

Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its

licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is
recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so
qualified, licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. The
Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement
a true and complete copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company (the "Company Certificate of Incorporation") and
the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "Company Bylaws") and the
comparable organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries and each other

Person owned, directly or indirectly, by the Company have, in all cases, been
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, and are owned, directly
or indirectly, by the Company free and clear of all pledges, liens, charges,

2013, the "Company Stock Options") and (iii) no shares of Company Preferred
Stock were issued or outstanding or held by the Company in its treasury.
Except as set forth above, at the close of business on May 24, 2013, no shares
of capital stock or other voting securities of the Company were issued or

there have been no issuances by the Company of options, warrants, other rights
to acquire shares of capital stock of the Company or other rights that give
the holder thereof any economic interest of a nature accruing to the holders
of Company Common Stock, except for rights pursuant to the ESPP and under the

Company from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material
respect.

(e) SEC Documents; Financial Statements.

(i) The Company has filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents with the SEC required to be filed by the Company since January 1,
2011 (the "SEC Documents"). As of their respective dates of filing, or, in the
case of SEC Documents that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act, their respective effective dates, the SEC
Documents complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable thereto, and
except to the extent amended or superseded by a subsequent filing with the SEC
prior to the date hereof, none of the SEC Documents contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each
SEC Document that is a registration statement, as amended, if applicable,
filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such registration
statement or amendment became effective, did not contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements made therein not misleading. The
Company has made available to Parent all material correspondence with the SEC
since January 1, 2011 and, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC with respect to any
of the Company Filed SEC Documents and, to the Knowledge of the Company, as of
the date of this Agreement, none of the Company Filed SEC Documents is the
subject of any ongoing review by the SEC.

(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements and the unaudited quarterly
financial statements (including, in each case, the notes thereto) of the
Company included in the SEC Documents when filed complied as to form in all
material respects with the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in all material respects in accordance
with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except,
in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as permitted by Form 10‑Q of
the SEC or other rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods and as of the dates involved (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results of their
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case of
unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year‑end adjustments, none of which
adjustments are expected to be material).

(iii) Since January 1, 2011, subject to any applicable grace periods, the
Company has been and is in compliance with (i) the applicable provisions of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and (ii)
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the
New York Stock Exchange, except in each case for any such noncompliance that
has not had or would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

(iv) (A) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by
Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act and (B) the Company has disclosed
since January 1, 2011, to the Company\'s auditors and the audit committee of
the Company\'s Board of Directors (1) any significant deficiencies and

binding and enforceable in accordance with their terms, are in full force and
effect and transfer such risk as would be required for such treaties and
agreements to be properly accounted for as reinsurance, except as are not, and
would not reasonably 

be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company

Disclosure Letter (it being understood that any information set forth in one
Section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to apply
to and qualify the Section or subsection of this Agreement to which it
corresponds in number and each other Section or subsection of this Agreement
to the extent that it is reasonably apparent in light of the context and
content of the disclosure that such information is relevant to such other
Section or subsection), Parent and Sub represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

(a) Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is duly organized and validly existing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate, company or
partnership power and authority to carry on its business as presently
conducted. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed
to do business and is in good standing (where such concept is recognized under
applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the
ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such qualification or
licensing necessary, other than where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has made available
to the Company prior to the execution of this Agreement a true and complete
copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of Parent (the
"Parent Certificate of Incorporation") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
Parent (the "Parent Bylaws") and the comparable organizational documents of
Sub and each of Parent\'s "significant subsidiaries" (as such term is defined

Stock were issued and outstanding (which number includes 8,497,611 shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to vesting or other forfeiture conditions or
repurchase by Parent (such shares, together with any similar shares issued

of Parent Common Stock held by the Company in its treasury, (ii) 8,497,611
shares of Parent Common Stock were subject to outstanding options (other than
rights under Parent\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (such plan, the "Parent
ESPP" and, along with Parent\'s 2005 Omnibus Incentive Plan, the "Parent Stock
Plans")) to acquire shares of Parent Common Stock from Parent (such options,
together with any similar options granted after May 24, 2013, the "Parent
Stock Options") and (iii) no shares of Parent Preferred Stock were issued or
outstanding or held by Parent in its treasury. Except as set forth above, at
the close of business on May 24, 2013, no shares of capital stock or other
voting securities of Parent were issued or outstanding. Since May 24, 2013 to
the date of this Agreement, (x) there have been no issuances by Parent of
shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Parent, other than
issuances of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of
outstanding Parent Stock Options and (y) there have been no issuances by

of Parent or other rights that give the holder thereof any economic interest
of a nature accruing to the holders of Parent Common Stock, except for rights
pursuant to the Parent ESPP and under Parent\'s 401(k) Profit Sharing Plan
(the "Parent 401(k) Plan"). All outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock are,
and all such shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time will be
when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
not subject to preemptive rights. There are no bonds, debentures, notes or
other indebtedness of Parent having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
holders of Parent Common Stock may vote ("Voting Parent Debt"). Except for any
obligations pursuant to this Agreement, the ESPP, the Parent 401(k) Plan or as
otherwise set forth above, as of May 24, 2013, there are no options, warrants,
rights, convertible or exchangeable securities, stock-based performance units,
Contracts or undertakings of any kind to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them is bound 

(1) obligating Parent or any such Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or
cause to be issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or
other equity interests in, or any security convertible or exchangeable for any
capital stock of or other equity interest in, Parent or of any of its
Subsidiaries or any Voting Parent Debt, (2) obligating Parent or any such
Subsidiary to issue, grant or enter into any such option, warrant, right,
security, unit, Contract or undertaking or (3) that give any person the right
to receive any economic interest of a nature accruing to the holders of Parent
Common Stock or otherwise based on the performance or value of shares of
capital stock of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no outstanding contractual obligations of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
capital stock or options, warrants or other rights to acquire shares of
capital stock of Parent or any such Subsidiary, other than as described above
pursuant to the Parent Stock Plans and pursuant to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(c) Authority; Noncontravention. (i) Each of Parent and Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions, subject, in the case of the Parent Share
Issuance, to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval. The execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have been
duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of
Parent and Sub, and no other corporate proceedings, subject, in the case of
the Parent Share Issuance, to receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval on
the part of Parent or Sub are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to
consummate the Transactions. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by each of Parent and Sub and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, constitutes a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each of Parent and Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and
Sub in accordance with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors\' rights and to general equity principles. The Board of

at the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting, and resolved to recommend that the
stockholders of Parent approve the Parent Share Issuance at the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting (to the extent such approval is required under
applicable Law), which resolutions, as of the date of this Agreement, have not
been rescinded, modified or withdrawn in any way.

(ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement do not, and the consummation
of the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to the loss of
a benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or Sub under (other than any such Lien created
in connection with the Financing), any provision of (A) the Parent Certificate
of Incorporation, the Parent Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws of Sub or (B) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in
the immediately following sentence, (1) any Contract to which Parent or Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound or (2) any Law applicable to Parent
or Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case of clause (B) above, any such
conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults, rights, losses or Liens that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. Assuming the accuracy of the Company\'s
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.01(d), no consent,
approval, order or authorization of, registration, declaration or filing with,
or notice to, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or
with respect to Parent or Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries in

Entity set forth on Section 3.02(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter and (VII)

would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all material
respects the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated

terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the amounts set forth therein
(being collectively referred to as the "Initial Debt Financing" and, together
with the Initial Equity Financing, collectively referred to as the "Initial
Financing"). For purposes of this Section 3.02(g), in the event that Parent

set forth in this Section 3.02(g) shall be deemed to be made with respect to
both the Initial Financing Commitments and the Additional Financing
Commitments; provided that with respect to the Additional Financing
Commitments and the Additional Financing, references to the "date of this

of the Adjustment Notice". As of the date hereof, neither of the Equity
Financing Commitments nor the Debt Financing Commitment has been amended or
modified, no such amendment or modification is contemplated (other than
amendments or modifications permitted by Section 5.09(a)), and none of the
respective obligations and commitments contained in such letters have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Parent or Sub has fully

hereof and (C) compliance in all material respects by the Company with its
covenants and agreements under Section 4.01(a), the net proceeds contemplated

will in the aggregate be sufficient for Parent, Sub and the Surviving
Corporation to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration, all requisite payments of
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.02(i), all requisite
payments of dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.01(c)

related fees and expenses of Parent, Sub and the Surviving Corporation
(collectively, the "Required Closing Cash Payments") . As of the date hereof,
the Debt Financing Commitment is (x) the legal, valid and binding obligations
of Parent and Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge of Parent and Sub,
each of the other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with their
respective terms against Parent and Sub, as applicable, and, to the Knowledge
of Parent and Sub, each of the other parties thereto, subject, as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general
applicability relating to or affecting creditors\' rights and to general
equity principles and (z) in full force and effect. The Equity Financing
Commitment is (x) the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub
and each of the other parties thereto, (y) enforceable in accordance with its
terms against the parties thereto, subject, as to enforceability, to
bankruptcy, insolvency and other Laws of general applicability relating to or
affecting creditors\' rights and to general equity principles and (z) in full
force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement, no event has occurred
which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would or would
reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part of Parent
or Sub or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other parties thereto under the
Financing Commitments; provided that Parent is not making any representation
or warranty regarding the effect of (A) any inaccuracy in the representations
and warranties set forth in Article III hereof or (B) the failure by the
Company to comply with any covenant or agreement herein, as applicable. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach on the part
of Parent or Sub or any other parties thereto under the Equity Financing
Commitment. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions to Parent\'s and Sub\'s
obligation to consummate the Merger neither Parent nor Sub have any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or
that the Financing will not be made available to Parent or Sub on the Closing
Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related to the
funding of the full amount of the Financing, other than as expressly set forth
in the Financing Commitments. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Contracts or other agreements, arrangements or 

understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to enter into
agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) to which
Parent or any of its Affiliates is a party related to the Financing other than
as expressly contained in the Financing Commitments and delivered to the
Company prior to the date hereof. Other than the Initial Equity Financing
Letter and, if applicable, the Additional Financing Commitments, there are no
Contracts or other agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or
written) or commitments to enter into agreements, arrangements or
understandings (whether oral or written) between Parent or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and THL or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand, which (A) contains additional or adversely modified conditions or other
contingencies to the availability of the Equity Financing relative to those
contained in the Equity Financing Commitments, (B) would otherwise reasonably
be expected to prevent or materially impair or delay the funding of the Equity
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Equity Financing) on the
Closing Date or the Closing, (C) adversely impacts the ability of Parent or
Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Equity Financing
Commitments or (D) reduces the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing set
forth in the Equity Financing Commitments.

(h) Operations and Assets of Sub. Sub has been formed solely for the purpose
of engaging in the Transactions and, prior to the Effective Time, will not
have incurred liabilities or obligations of any nature, other than pursuant to
or in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
Transactions. As of the date of this Agreement, Parent owns beneficially and,
directly or indirectly, of record all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Sub, free and clear of all Liens (other than any Liens created
pursuant to the Financing), and as of the Closing Date Parent will
beneficially own at least a majority of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Sub, free and clear of all Liens (other than any Liens created
pursuant to the Financing).

(i) Ownership of Company Common Stock. None of Parent, Sub or any of their
Subsidiaries beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder), or will
prior to the Closing Date beneficially own, any shares of Company Common
Stock, or is a party, or will prior to the Closing Date become a party, to any
Contract, arrangement or understanding (other than this Agreement) for the
purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of any shares of Company
Common Stock.

(j) Litigation. There is no suit, action, claim, arbitration, mediation or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent or Sub, threatened against
Parent or Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. There is no injunction, order, judgment, ruling,
decree or writ of any Governmental Entity outstanding against Parent or Sub or
any of their respective Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate,
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Since January 1, 2011, neither Parent nor Sub nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries has received any notice alleging any non-compliance or
violations of Law from, or any notice of any actual or pending investigations
by, any Governmental Entity, that, individually or in the aggregate, has had
or would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(k) Compliance with Laws. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is (and since
January 1, 2011 or, if later, its respective date of formation or
organization, has been) in compliance with all Laws applicable to its business
or operations and all internal and posted policies related to the data privacy
of third parties (including customers and clients of Parents and its
Subsidiaries), except for such noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to be material to Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has (and
since January 1, 2011 or, if later, its respective date of formation or
organization, has had) in effect all Authorizations necessary for it to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets and to conduct their business as
presently conducted, and all such Authorizations are in full force and effect,
except for such Authorizations the absence of which, or the failure of which
to be in full force and effect, is not and would not reasonably be expected to
be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Parent and its
Subsidiaries are not in violation or breach of, or default under, any
Authorization, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, no suspension or cancellation
of any Authorization is pending or threatened, except where such violation,
breach, default, suspension or cancellation would not reasonably be expected
to be material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. As of the
date of this Agreement, no event or condition has occurred or exists which
would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries under, any
Authorization (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both),
except for violations, breaches, defaults, losses or accelerations that have
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. To the Knowledge of Parent, each
person with whom Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has entered into a written
agreement to perform the duties of title insurance agent, at the time such
person wrote, sold or produced title insurance business, or performed such
other act for or on behalf of Parent or such Subsidiary that may require an
agent\'s or other insurance license, was duly licensed and appointed, where
required, for the type of business written, sold or produced by such person,
in the particular jurisdiction in which such person wrote, sold, produced,
solicited or serviced such business, as may be required by any applicable Law,
except in each such case where the failure to be so licensed or appointed has
not had and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. 

(l) Voting Requirements. The affirmative vote of holders of a majority in
voting power of the shares of Parent Common Stock represented at the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof (provided,
that at least a majority in voting power of the shares of Parent Common Stock
are represented in person or by proxy at such meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof) (the "Parent Stockholder Approval") is the only vote of
the holders of any class or series of capital stock of Parent necessary to
approve the Parent Share Issuance and the other Transactions contemplated
hereby.

(m) State Takeover Statutes. Assuming that neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries beneficially owns (within the meaning of Section 13 of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder) any shares
of Parent Common Stock, no state takeover statute applies to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other Merger Transactions.

(n) Brokers and Other Advisors. No broker, investment banker, financial
advisor or other person, other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker\'s, finder\'s or financial
advisor\'s fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent or Sub..

(o) Opinion of Financial Advisor. Parent\'s Board of Directors has received
the opinions of (x) Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to the assumptions and
limitations set forth therein, the consideration to be paid in the transaction
by Parent is fair, from a financial point of view, to Parent, and (y) J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and
subject to the assumptions and limitations set forth therein, the
consideration to be paid by Parent in the transaction is fair, from a
financial point of view, to Parent, a signed copy of which opinions will
promptly be delivered to the Company, solely for informational purposes,
following receipt thereof by Parent.

(p) Solvency. Assuming (i) satisfaction of the conditions to Parent\'s
obligation to consummate the Merger, and after giving effect to the
Transactions and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, Restricted
Stock Consideration, Option Payments, Designated Matching Contributions and
Retention Incentive Award Consideration, any repayment or refinancing of debt
contemplated in this Agreement or the Financing Commitments (ii) the accuracy
of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in Article III
hereof in all material respects, (iii) payment of all amounts required to be
paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (including, in
each case, payment of all related fees and expenses) and (iv) any estimates,
projections or forecasts of the Company and its Subsidiaries have been
prepared by them in good faith based upon assumptions that were and continue
to be reasonable, each of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be Solvent
as of the Effective Time and immediately after the consummation of the
Transactions. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used
with respect to any person, means that, as of any date of determination (A)
the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of such person will, as
of such date, exceed (1) the value of all "liabilities of such person,
including contingent and other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted
terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (2) the amount that will be
required to pay the probable liabilities of such person, as of such date, on
its existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (B) such person will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date, and (C)
such person will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" means
that such person will be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its obligations
as they become due.

(q) No Other Arrangements. There are no Contracts or other agreements,
arrangements or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to
enter into agreements, arrangements or understandings (whether oral or
written) (i) between Parent, Sub or any of their Affiliates, on the one hand,
and any of the Company\'s officers or directors, on the other hand, that
relate in any way to the Transactions or were entered into or made in
contemplation of any of the Transactions or (ii) pursuant to which any
stockholder of the Company would be entitled to receive consideration of a
different amount or nature than the Merger Consideration or pursuant to which
any stockholder of the Company agrees to vote to adopt this Agreement or the
Merger or agrees to vote against any Takeover Proposal, other than, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, those entered into with the prior written
consent of the Board of Directors of the Company.

(r) No Other Representations or Warranties. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in this Section 3.02, the Company acknowledges that
neither Parent nor Sub nor any other person on behalf of Parent or Sub makes
any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
Parent, Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or with respect to any
other information provided to the Company in connection with the Transactions.
Neither Parent nor Sub nor any other person will have or be subject to any
liability or indemnification obligation to the Company or any other person
resulting from the distribution to the Company, or the Company\'s use of, any
such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts
or other material made available to the Company in certain "data rooms" or
management 

presentations in expectation of the Transactions, unless and then only to the
extent that any such information is expressly included in a representation or
warranty contained in this Section 3.02.

SECTION 4.02. Solicitation. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, during the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and continuing until 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on July 7, 2013
(the "Solicitation Period End-Time"), the Company and its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives shall have the right (acting under the
direction of the Board of Directors of the Company) to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate and encourage, whether publicly or
otherwise, Takeover Proposals (except that the reference to 15% in such term
will be deemed changed to 50% for purposes of this Section 4.02(a)), including
by way of providing access to non-public information (subject to entering into
an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with each recipient before providing
access to such non-public information); provided that the Company shall
concurrently provide to Parent any material non-public information concerning
the Company or its Subsidiaries that is to be provided to any person given
such access which was not previously provided to Parent, and (ii) enter into,
engage in and maintain discussions or negotiations with respect to Takeover
Proposals or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or
facilitate any such discussions or negotiations or the making of any Takeover
Proposal.

The term "Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
person or group of persons relating to (a) any direct or indirect acquisition
or purchase in any manner, in each case whether in a single transaction or a
series of transactions, of (1) 15% or more (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company)
of the consolidated total assets (including capital stock of the Subsidiaries
of the Company) of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (2)
15% or more of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, (b) any tender
offer or exchange offer, in each case whether in a single transaction or a
series of transactions, that, if consummated, would result in any person or
group or persons owning, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or (c) any merger, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to which any person or group (or the stockholders of any
person) would own, directly or indirectly, (i) 15% or more of any class of
equity securities of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or
(ii) businesses or assets that constitute 15% or more of the consolidated
revenues, net income or total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
other than, in each case, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Subject to Section 4.02(c) and Section 4.02(e):

(i) Except with respect to any bona fide written Takeover Proposal (with the
reference to 15% in such term being deemed changed to 50% for purposes of this
exception) received after the date hereof and prior to the Solicitation Period
End-Time with respect to which the requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of
Section 4.02(c) have been satisfied as of the Solicitation Period End-Time
(any person or group of persons so submitting such a Takeover Proposal,
together with any other persons that join such person or group of persons,
provided that such persons who were members of such group immediately prior to
the Solicitation Period End-Time constitute at least 50% of the equity
financing of such group at all times following the Solicitation Period End-
Time, an "Excluded Party"), the Company shall not and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, from the Solicitation Period End-Time until the Effective Date,
(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage the submission of any Takeover
Proposal, (B) engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto
or (C) otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate any
such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section
4.02 to the contrary, any Excluded Party shall cease to be an Excluded Party
for all purposes under this Agreement at such 

time as the Takeover Proposal made by such person (1) fails to satisfy the
requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 4.02(c) or (2) is withdrawn,
terminates or expires.

(ii) Except as permitted with respect to an Excluded Party pursuant to Section
4.02(a) or Section 4.02(b)(i), upon the Solicitation Period End-Time, the
Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated any solicitation,
knowing encouragement, discussion or negotiation of or with, or cooperation
with, or assistance or participation in, or facilitation of (including by way
of providing access to non-public information), any such inquiries, proposals,
discussions or negotiations with any person or group of persons conducted
theretofore by the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives with respect to any Takeover Proposal and use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all confidential information provided by or on
behalf of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives to such person or group of persons be returned or destroyed.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.02(b), but
subject to Section 4.02(a) and the last sentence of this paragraph, if at any
time following the Solicitation Period End-Time and prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company has received a written Takeover
Proposal from a third party that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith to be bona fide, (ii) the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company\'s
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover Proposal
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
(iii) after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith that failing to take such
action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under
applicable Law and (iv) there has been no material breach of this Section 4.02
in connection with such Takeover Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the person
making such Takeover Proposal, and (B) engage in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Takeover Proposal regarding such Takeover
Proposal; provided that the Company (x) will not, and will not allow its
Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, disclose any non-public
information to such person without first entering into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such person, and (y) will concurrently provide,
in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, to Parent any
material non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries to
be provided to such other person which was not previously provided to Parent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 4.02(b) or this
Section 4.02(c), prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the
Company shall be permitted to take the actions described in Section 4.02(a)
and clauses (A) and (B) above with respect to any Excluded Party, including
with respect to any amended or revised proposal submitted by such Excluded
Party following the Solicitation Period End-Time that satisfies the
requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 4.02(c), and the restrictions
in this Section 4.02(c) shall not apply with respect thereto.

The term "Superior Proposal" means any bona fide Takeover Proposal (with the
percentages set forth in the definition thereof changed from 15% to 50%) made
in writing that the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
is reasonably likely to be consummated and that is on terms which the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Company\'s financial advisor and outside counsel) would be more favorable to
the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the
Merger, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory, financing,
certainty and timing of consummation and other aspects of such proposal and of
this Agreement (including any changes to the financial and other terms of this
Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company prior to the expiration of the
applicable periods referred to in Section 4.02(e) below in response to such
proposal or otherwise).

(d) As promptly as practicable after the Solicitation Period End-Time (but in
no event more than 24 hours following the Solicitation Period End-Time), the
Board of Directors of the Company shall, subject to Section 4.02(e), reaffirm
its recommendation that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement
and the Company shall (i) notify Parent in writing of the identity of each
person, if any, that, in accordance with this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company has determined to be an Excluded Party (for the
avoidance of doubt, no person shall be an Excluded Party unless the Board of
Directors of the Company determines that such party is an Excluded Party on
the day of the Solicitation Period End-Time and notifies Parent of such
determination within 24 hours of the Solicitation Period End-Time) and (ii)
provide Parent with the material terms and conditions of each Takeover
Proposal received from any Excluded Party. From and after the Solicitation
Period End-Time, the Company shall as promptly as practicable (but in any
event within 24 hours) notify Parent, orally and in writing, in the event that
the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives receives (A) any Takeover Proposal or (B) any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
furtherance of a Takeover Proposal, and in each case shall include in such
notice a copy of such Takeover Proposal or request (or, where no such copy
exists or is available, a written description thereof that includes the
material terms and conditions thereof), including the identity of the person
making such Takeover Proposal or request. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed on a prompt basis of the status of such Takeover Proposal
or request (including the terms and conditions thereof) and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations with respect to any such Takeover
Proposal or request (including any material changes thereto). 

(e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof
shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such
Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or
(B) recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, declare
advisable or publicly propose to recommend, approve, adopt or declare
advisable, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as an "Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or cause or permit the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement or other similar agreement related to any Takeover
Proposal, other than any Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement referred to in
Section 4.02(a) or Section 4.02(c) (an "Acquisition Agreement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and
subject to compliance with Section 5.06(b), the Board of Directors of the
Company may, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law: (x) in response to a
Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, make an Adverse Recommendation Change
or (y) if the Company has complied in all material respects with this Section
4.02, cause the Company to terminate this Agreement and, concurrently with or
immediately after such termination, cause the Company to enter into an
Acquisition Agreement; provided, however, that (1) no Adverse Recommendation
Change may be made and (2) no termination of this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 4.02(e) may be made, until after the fifth business day following
Parent\'s receipt of written notice from the Company advising Parent that the
Board of Directors of the Company intends to (x) in the case of clause (1)
above, make an Adverse Recommendation Change (a "Notice of Adverse
Recommendation") or (y) in the case of clause (2) above, terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 4.02(e) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal")
and specifying the reasons therefor, including, (i) if the basis of the
proposed action by the Board of Directors of the Company is a Superior
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the person making such Superior Proposal and a copy
of the then-current forms of all of the relevant proposed transaction
documents related thereto, including definitive agreements with respect to
such Superior Proposal and the documents with respect to any financing of such
Superior Proposal) or (ii) if the basis of the proposed action by the Board of
Directors of the Company is an Intervening Event, a description of the
Intervening Event and, unless the Company shall have:

(i) during the five business day period specified below (and any additional
period related to a revision to the Superior Proposal, as provided below),
negotiated, and caused its financial and legal advisors to negotiate, with
Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect
to proposed adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal (or, in the
case of a Notice of Adverse Recommendation that is not related to a Superior
Proposal, so that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change is no
longer inconsistent with the Board of Directors of the Company\'s fiduciary
duties to stockholders under applicable Law); and

(ii) prior to or concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 4.02(e), paid the Company Termination Fee required under Section
5.06(b)(i).

In the event of any revisions to the Superior Proposal the Company shall be
required to deliver a new Notice of Superior Proposal and to again comply with
the requirements of this Section 4.02(e) with respect to such new Superior
Proposal (except that references to the five business day period shall, after
the expiration of the initial five business day period, be deemed to be
references to a two business day period). The Company agrees that any
violation of this Section 4.02 by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives shall be deemed to be a material breach of
this Agreement by the Company. In determining whether to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to cause the Company to so terminate this Agreement
pursuant to the terms of this Section 4.02(e), the Board of Directors of the
Company shall take into account any changes to the financial and other terms
of this Agreement proposed by Parent to the Company in response to a Notice of
Adverse Recommendation or Notice of Superior Proposal. "Intervening Event"
means, with respect to either the Company or Parent, a material event or
circumstance that was not known or reasonably foreseeable to the board of
directors of such party on the date of this Agreement (or if known, the
consequences of which are not known to or reasonably foreseeable by such board
of directors as of the date hereof), which event or circumstance, or any
consequence thereof, becomes known to the board of directors of such party
prior to the time at which such party receives the Company Stockholder
Approval or Parent Stockholder Approval, as applicable; provided, however,
that in no event shall any of the following constitute an Intervening Event:
(i) any failure to arrange or receive the Financing, or (ii) any change in, or
event or condition generally affecting, the industry in which the Company or
Parent operates.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e‑2(a) or Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any
disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
stockholders under applicable Law; provided that (x) clause (ii) of this
Section 4.02(f) shall not be deemed 

to permit the Board of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse
Recommendation Change or take any of the actions referred to in clause (ii) of
Section 4.02(e) except, in each case, to the extent permitted by Section
4.02(e) and (y) in any disclosure made pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this
Section 4.02(f) (other than any disclosure made in connection with an Adverse
Recommendation Change permitted by Section 4.02(e)), the Board of Directors of
the Company shall expressly publicly reaffirm its Recommendation to its
stockholders in favor of the Merger.

ARTICLE V

Additional Agreements

SECTION 5.01. Preparation of the Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders\'
Meetings. (a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this
Agreement, (i) Parent and the Company shall jointly prepare and file with the
SEC the joint proxy statement (as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the "Joint Proxy Statement") to be sent to the stockholders of Parent relating
to the meeting of Parent\'s stockholders (the "Parent Stockholders\' Meeting")
to be held to consider the Parent Share Issuance and to the stockholders of
the Company relating to the meeting of the Company\'s stockholders (the
"Company Stockholders\' Meeting") to be held to consider adoption of this
Agreement and (ii) Parent shall prepare (with the Company\'s reasonable
cooperation) and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 (as
amended or supplemented from time to time, the "Form S-4"), in which the Joint
Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be issued

efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing (including by responding to comments
of the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, Parent shall
take all action reasonably required to be taken under any applicable state
securities Laws in connection with the Parent Share Issuance; provided that
the Company shall be under no obligation to, and Parent and Sub shall not,
have the Form S-4 declared effective under the Securities Act prior to the
Solicitation Period End-Time. Each of Parent and the Company shall furnish all
information as may be reasonably requested by the other in connection with any
such action and the preparation, filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and
the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 shall

best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to its respective
stockholders; provided that the Company shall be under no obligation to mail

providing the other party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy
Statement, so that either such document would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement
describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the
Company. The parties shall notify each other promptly of the time when the
Form S-4 has become effective, of the issuance of any stop order or suspension
of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with
the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or
the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy
Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional information and shall supply each
other with copies of all correspondence between it or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form S-4 or the Merger.

(b) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
effectiveness of the Form S-4 and subject to applicable Law, the Company
Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws and the rules of New York
Stock Exchange, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Company Stockholders\' Meeting, and submit this Agreement
to its stockholders for adoption, for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval; provided that the Company shall be under no obligation
to establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene or hold the
Company Stockholders\' Meeting prior to the Solicitation Period End-Time.
Subject to the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.02(e), the Company shall,
(i) through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption of
this Agreement and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy
Statement and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders
the Company Stockholder Approval in favor of the adoption of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall, to the extent permitted by the Company Certificate of
Incorporation and the Company Bylaws and applicable Law, adjourn or postpone
the Company Stockholders\' Meeting (i) after consultation with Parent, to the
extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting or
(ii) if as of the time for which the Company Stockholders\' Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company 

Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum
necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders\' Meeting.

(c) Parent shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the
effectiveness of the Form S-4 and subject to applicable Law, the Parent
Certificate of Incorporation, the Parent Bylaws and the rules of New York
Stock Exchange, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of,
convene and hold the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval. Parent shall, through its Board of
Directors, recommend to its stockholders approval of the Parent Share Issuance
and shall include such recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement and use
reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Parent Stockholder
Approval, and shall not (i) withdraw (or modify or qualify in a manner adverse
to the Company), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify or qualify in a
manner adverse to the Company), such recommendation or (ii) make any other
public statement in connection with the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting
inconsistent with such recommendation (any action described in clauses (i) or
(ii) being referred to herein as a "Parent Adverse Recommendation Change").
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, and
subject to compliance with the provisions of this Section 5.01(c), the Board
of Directors of Parent may, if the Board of Directors of Parent determines in
good faith (after consultation with the Company\'s financial advisor and
outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law,
make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Parent shall, to the extent permitted by the Parent Certificate of
Incorporation and the Parent Bylaws and applicable Law, adjourn or postpone
the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting (i) after consultation with the Company, to
the extent necessary to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to
the Joint Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of Parent within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting or
(ii) if as of the time for which the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Joint Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Parent Common Stock represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting.

(d) The parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to hold the Company
Stockholders\' Meeting and the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting on the same day
at the same time.

(e) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Article
VII, the Company shall submit this Agreement to its stockholders for adoption
at the Company Stockholders\' Meeting even if the Board of Directors of the
Company shall have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) if Parent
elects to pay all of the Merger Consideration in cash in accordance with
Section 2.01(g), then Parent shall have no obligation to duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting and Parent and
the Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to convert the Form
S-4 and Joint Proxy Statement to a proxy statement relating to the adoption by
the stockholders of the Company of this Agreement and the provisions of this
Agreement shall continue to apply mutatis mutandis and (ii) if Parent elects
to pay a greater portion of the Merger Consideration in cash in accordance
with Section 2.01(g) and as a result Parent and the Company each agree (as
reflected in writing) that the Parent Stockholder Approval will thereafter not
be required, then Parent shall have no obligation to duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders\' Meeting and Parent and the
Company shall take all actions reasonably necessary to convert the Form S-4
and Joint Proxy Statement to a Form S-4 and proxy statement relating to the
adoption by the stockholders of the Company of this Agreement and the
provisions of this Agreement shall continue to apply mutatis mutandis;
provided that if Parent and the Company agree not to hold the Parent
Stockholders\' Meeting pursuant to this clause (ii), thereafter Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall not purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of
Parent Common Stock if, as a result of such purchases, redemptions and other
acquisitions (individually or in the aggregate), the Parent Stockholder
Approval would be required by applicable Law..

SECTION 5.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Each of the Company,
Parent, Sub and their respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel,
consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives and sources of Debt
Financing and Equity Financing, shall afford to each other reasonable access
during normal business hours during the period prior to the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its
Subsidiaries\' properties, books and records and to those employees of the
Company or Parent or their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, to whom
such persons reasonably request access, and, during such period, each of the
Company and Parent shall furnish, as promptly as practicable to such persons
all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries\' business, properties and
personnel as such persons may reasonably request. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, neither the Company nor Parent nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose information if
the Company or Parent, as applicable, reasonably determines that such access
or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, or contravene
any Law to which the Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
as applicable, is a party; provided that, in any such case, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, shall provide such information in redacted form as
necessary to preserve such privilege or comply with such Law or otherwise make
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements, to the extent possible. Except
for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality letter
agreement dated as 

of April 4, 2013, between Parent and the Company (as such agreement may be
amended from time to time, the "Confidentiality Agreement"), each of the
Company and Parent shall hold, and shall cause their respective officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives
to hold, all information received from the other party or its Representatives,
directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement. No information or knowledge obtained by any person in any
investigation pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation or warranty made by any party hereto.

SECTION 5.03. Reasonable Best Efforts. (a) Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to use reasonable best efforts to, take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Transactions, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to
Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the taking of all
actions necessary to comply with all orders, decrees and requests imposed by
Governmental Entities in connection with the Transactions, (iii) the obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, authorizations,
orders and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including filings under the
HSR Act) applicable to the Transactions and other registrations, declarations
and filings with, or notices to, Governmental Entities, including the NYSDFS
and, except to the extent that an applicable exemption applies, CDI, and those
approvals set forth on Section 3.01(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter and
3.02(c) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, and the taking of all steps as may be
necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation by, any Governmental Entity, (iv) the
obtaining of consents, approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably
requested by Parent to be obtained in connection with the Transactions;
provided, however, that in no event shall any of the parties hereto or any of
their respective Affiliates be required to (and in no event shall the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, without Parent\'s prior written approval) make any
payment to such third parties or concede anything of value in any case prior
to the Effective Time in order to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver
from any such third parties, (v) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement and (vi) as promptly as reasonably practicable
following the receipt thereof, responding to any formal or informal request
for additional information or documentary material received by the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Affiliates from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Transactions. In connection with and without limiting the
foregoing, each of Parent and the Company and their respective Boards of
Directors shall (A) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute is or becomes applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the
other Merger Transactions and (B) if any state takeover statute becomes
applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other Merger
Transactions, take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger and the
other Merger Transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other Merger
Transactions.

(b) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve or eliminate such
objections or impediments, if any, as may be asserted by a Governmental Entity
or other Person with respect to the Merger Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall, without Parent\'s prior written consent, and
neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to, agree to
divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to take
any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or Parent\'s,
the Surviving Corporation\'s or any of their Subsidiaries\' ability to retain
any of the businesses or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries that are
material to Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as whole, or any businesses or
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would reasonably be
expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse
effect on the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(c) Neither Parent nor the Company shall, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire any business,
person or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to such
acquisition or the consummation of such acquisition would reasonably be
expected to result in (i) the failure to obtain or materially impair or delay
the obtaining of the expiration or termination of the waiting period in
respect of the Transactions under any applicable Law, (ii) the entry, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry, or failure to effect the
dissolution, in each case, of any injunction, temporary restraining order or
other order that would prevent or materially impair or delay the consummation
of the Transactions or (iii) failure to obtain or materially impair or delay
the obtaining of all waivers, authorizations, consents, orders and approvals
of Governmental Entities necessary for the consummation of the Transactions.

(d) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company and Parent shall
keep each other reasonably apprised of the status of matters relating to the
completion of the Merger and the other Transactions, including promptly
furnishing the other with copies of notices or other substantive
communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or Governmental
Entity with respect to the consents or approvals referred to in Section
6.01(b) and, to the extent reasonably practicable, permit the other party to
review in advance any proposed substantive written communication by such party
to any Governmental Entity with respect to the consents or approvals referred 

to in Section 6.01(b) and consider in good faith the other party\'s reasonable
comments on any such proposed substantive written communications prior to
their submission. Neither Parent nor the Company shall, and each shall cause
its Affiliates not to, participate or agree to participate in any substantive
meeting or communication with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
consents or approvals referred to in Section 6.01(b), including on a "no
names" or hypothetical basis, unless (to the extent practicable) it consults
with the other parties hereto in advance and, to the extent practicable and
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to jointly prepare for, attend and participate in such meeting or
communication.

SECTION 5.04. Benefit Plans. (a) Following the Effective Time and until the
later of the six month anniversary of the Closing Date and June 30, 2014,
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, the
individuals who are employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately before the Effective Time (the "Company Employees") and who
continue employment during such time period with (i) annual base compensation
and annual or quarterly (as applicable) cash incentive opportunities (as a
percentage of base salary) that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
the annual base compensation and cash incentive opportunities (excluding
equity compensation arrangements and any defined benefit pension arrangements)
provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) employee benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefits provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to
the Effective Time; provided, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation nor any of their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation
to issue, or to adopt any plans or arrangements providing for the issuance of,
shares of capital stock or any other rights in respect of any shares of
capital stock of any entity.

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under the Company Benefit Plans and
Company Benefit Agreements, including all of the Company\'s employment,
severance, retention and termination plans, programs, policies and
arrangements, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, including with respect to any
payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either
alone or in combination with any other event). No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed (i) as a guarantee of continued employment of any Company
Employee, (ii) to prohibit Parent or the Surviving Corporation from having the
right to terminate the employment of any Company Employee, (iii) to prevent
the amendment, modification or termination of any Company Benefit Plan or
Company Benefit Agreement after the Closing (in each case in accordance with
the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement)
or (iv) as an amendment or modification of the terms of any Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement.

(c) With respect to all plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and
severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, and vesting (but excluding benefit accruals),
each Company Employee\'s service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such
Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized
by the Company or such Subsidiary) shall be treated as service with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries to the
extent such service was recognized under the comparable Company Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that such service
need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 5.04(a), Parent shall cause to
be waived any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work
requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to
participate from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such
pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements
and waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the
comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Parent shall recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all
co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by each Company
Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying such year\'s
deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans
in which they will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective
Time.

(e) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein or in any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, for
purposes of any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement containing a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control", the Closing shall be
deemed to constitute a "change in control" or "change of control" (except as
would result in the imposition of "additional taxes" under Code Section 409A).

(f) The provisions of this Section 5.04 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no other person (including any Company Employee
or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any purpose as
a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement, and no provision of this Section
5.04 shall create such rights in any such persons.

SECTION 5.05. Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance. (a) All rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of
expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of 

this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to a Company Benefit Plan) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors as provided in the
Company Certificate of Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the organizational
documents of any Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement
set forth in Section 5.05(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, between a
director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to
a Company Benefit Plan) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof) shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any right
thereunder of any such director, officer, employee or agent.

(b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an "Indemnified Party") pursuant to any indemnification
agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a "Claim"),
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of
any board committee) or officer of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted
by Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages,
liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law
upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines
and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Claim. None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Claim for which indemnification would reasonably be expected to be sought by
an Indemnified Party hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability
arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in
writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense of any
matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder.
Parent\'s and the Surviving Corporation\'s obligations under this Section
5.05(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from
the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Claim.

(c) The Company may (or, at the request of Parent, shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to) obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years
from the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect
to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in
effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that, without the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company may not expend therefor in excess
of 250% of the amount (the "Annual Amount") paid by the Company for coverage
for the most recently completed 12-month period prior to the date of this
Agreement (such amount, equal to 250% of the annual amount, the "DandO Tail
Premium Cap"). In the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance
policies, then, for a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain in effect the Company\'s current directors\' and officers\'
liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; provided, however, that
Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable and financially sound
insurance company containing terms, including with respect to coverage and
amounts, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party; provided further,
however, that in satisfying their obligation under this Section 5.05(c),
Parent shall not be obligated to pay for coverage for any 12-month period
aggregate premiums for insurance in excess of the DandO Tail Premium Cap, it
being understood and agreed that Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to
provide such coverage as may be obtained for the Annual Amount.

(d) In the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any person, or if Parent
dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each such case, Parent shall
cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and
assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 5.05.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his
or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for,
any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of the Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this Section 5.05 will not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party without the written
consent of such Indemnified Party.

SECTION 5.06. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided in Section 5.06(b) and
Section 5.09(b), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees
or expenses, whether or not the Transactions are consummated. 

(b) In the event that:

(i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f);
or

(ii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Takeover Proposal shall have been
publicly made to the Company or shall have been made directly to the
stockholders of the Company generally or shall have otherwise become publicly
known, (B) thereafter, this Agreement is terminated (1) by Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii), (2) by Parent pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Company Stockholders\' Meeting has not been held
by the Outside Date) or (3) by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and (C)
within twelve months after such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement to consummate or consummates the transactions
contemplated by any Takeover Proposal; or

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(e);

(iv) then, in each case, the Company shall pay Parent or its designee(s) an
aggregate fee equal to the Company Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-
day funds (1) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) or (iii) above,
on the date of termination of this Agreement and (2) in the case of a payment
required by clause (ii) above, on the earlier of the date of entry into a
definitive agreement or the date of consummation referred to in clause
(ii)(C), it being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to
pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For purposes of
this Section 5.06(b), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning
assigned to such term in Section 4.02(a), except that all references to 15%
therein shall be deemed to be references to 50%.

(c) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(g), then Parent shall pay to the Company an aggregate fee equal to the
Parent Termination Fee by wire transfer of same-day funds, on the date of
termination of this Agreement.

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant
to Section 7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Company Stockholders\' Meeting has not
been held by the Outside Date) or by Parent pursuant to Section 7.01(c) and at
such time Parent is not in material breach of this Agreement and Parent is not
entitled to receive payment of the Company Termination Fee, then the Company
shall pay to Parent (or its designee(s)) an amount equal to the sum of the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent,
Sub and their respective Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any fees and expenses
related to the Financing) by wire transfer of same-day funds within two
business days after written request by Parent; provided that the payment by
the Company of such expenses shall not relieve the Company of the obligation,
if any, subsequently to pay the Company Termination Fee; provided, further,
that if the Company Termination Fee becomes payable by the Company, the amount
thereof shall be reduced by the amount of any of Parent\'s and Sub\'s expenses
previously reimbursed by the Company pursuant to this Section 5.06(d).

(e) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the agreements
contained in Section 5.06 are an integral part of the Transactions, and that,
without these agreements, the other parties hereto would not have entered into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
fails promptly to pay any amount due pursuant to Section 5.06, and, in order
to obtain such payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the other party for the payment set
forth in Section 5.06, such paying party shall pay to the other party or
parties, as applicable, its costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and
expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount
of such amount from the date such payment was required to be made until the
date of payment at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made.

SECTION 5.07.Public Announcements. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Transactions shall be in the form
heretofore agreed to by the parties. From the date of such announcement
through the Closing Date, and so long as this Agreement is in effect, none of
the Company, Parent or Sub shall issue or cause the publication of any public
press release or other public announcement concerning the Transactions without
the prior consultation and consent of the other parties hereto (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may be required by
applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national
securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any
matters referred to in Section 4.02.

SECTION 5.08.Stockholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to
the Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent\'s
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against Parent and/or its
directors or officers relating to the Transactions, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the Company\'s prior written consent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

SECTION 5.09. Financing. (a) (i) Each of Parent and Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, to consummate
and obtain the Financing 

as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms and subject only to the
conditions (including the flex provisions) contained in the Financing
Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts to (A) negotiate and
enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing on the
terms and subject only to the conditions (including the flex provisions)
contained in the Debt Financing Commitments, (B) satisfy (or obtain the waiver
of), and cause its Affiliates to satisfy (or obtain the waiver of), on a
timely basis all conditions, and comply with all obligations applicable to
Parent or Sub, contained in the Financing Commitments or the definitive
agreements related to the Debt Financing Commitments, (C) enforce its rights
under the Debt Financing Commitments at or prior to the Closing or (D) subject
to Section 5.09(a)(ii) below, maintain in effect the Financing Commitments in
accordance with the terms and provisions set forth in the Financing
Commitments. Each of Parent and Sub shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably
be expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions contained in the
Financing Commitments or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt
Financing. For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 5.09, Parent acknowledges and agrees that its
obligation to consummate the Transactions on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon the availability or
consummation of the Financing, the availability of any replacement commitments
or receipt of the proceeds therefrom.

(ii) Neither Parent nor Sub shall agree to or permit any amendment, supplement
or other modification of, or waive any of its rights under, or implement any
alternative financing that has the effect of reducing the amount of, any
Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt
Financing without the Company\'s prior written consent that (A) contains
additional or adversely modified conditions or other contingencies to the
availability of the Financing relative to those contained in the Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement (or solely with respect to any
revolving commitments, any additional or adversely modified conditions or
other contingencies to the availability of the Financing on the Closing Date
than those contained in the Existing Facility as of the date of this Agreement
or the Initial Financing Commitments as of the date of this Agreement), (B)
would otherwise reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impair or
delay the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the
Financing) on the Closing Date or the Closing, (C) adversely impacts the
ability of Parent or Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to
the Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements related to the Debt
Financing or (D) reduces the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing set
forth in the Equity Financing Commitments or the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing set forth in the Debt Financing Commitments, in each case as of the
date of this Agreement (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount, except as expressly contemplated in connection with
the flex provisions), unless, in the case of this clause (D), replaced with an
amount of new equity or debt financing on conditions no less favorable to the
Company than the terms set forth in the Financing Commitments as of the date
of this Agreement (or solely with respect to any revolving commitments, any
additional or adversely modified conditions or other contingencies to the
availability of the Financing on the Closing Date than those contained in the
Existing Facility as of the date of this Agreement or the Initial Financing
Commitments as of the date of this Agreement) (it being understood that,
subject to the requirements of this clause (ii), such amendment, supplement or
other modification of the Debt Financing Commitments may provide for the
assignment of a portion of the Debt Financing Commitments to additional
agents, financing sources or arrangers and grant such persons approval rights
with respect to certain matters as are customarily granted to additional
agents or arrangers). Parent shall (1) promptly deliver to the Company copies
of any amendment, modification or waiver to or under any Financing Commitment
or the definitive agreements relating to the Debt Financing and (2) prior to
entering into any replacement commitments with respect to the Replacement
Revolving Facility in the form of other revolving commitments, deliver to the
Company true and complete copies of, and consult with the Company with respect
to, all Contracts or other arrangements (including Redacted Fee Letters)
related to replacement of the commitments with respect to the Replacement
Revolving Facility, in each case which may be redacted in a manner reasonably
satisfactory to the applicable Financing Source; provided that such redactions
do not relate to any terms that could adversely affect the conditionality,
enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate principal amount of the
debt financing or other funding being made available by such Financing Source.
In the event that Parent obtains Additional Financing Commitments, this
Section 5.09(a)(ii) shall be deemed to apply to such Additional Financing
Commitments and the Additional Financing; provided that with respect to the
Additional Financing Commitments and the Additional Financing, references to
the "date of this Agreement" or the "date hereof" shall be deemed to be
references to the "date of the Adjustment Notice". For purposes of this
Agreement, "Existing Facility" means Parent\'s unsecured revolving credit
facility pursuant to that certain Second Amended and Restated Credit
Agreement, dated as of April 16, 2012 (as amended, restated, amended and
restated, supplemented or otherwise modified on or prior to the date hereof),
among Parent, the lenders from time to time party thereto, Bank of America,
N.A., as administrative agent, and the other agents party thereto.

(iii) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and provide to the Company copies (including drafts) of the material
definitive documents for the Debt Financing. Parent and Sub shall give the
Company prompt written notice (A) of any actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Financing Commitments or
definitive 

documents related to the Debt Financing of which Parent or Sub becomes aware,
(B) of the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from
any source of the Financing with respect to any (1) actual or potential
breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any of the
Financing Commitments or any definitive document related to the Debt Financing
of any provisions of the Financing Commitments or any definitive document
related to the Debt Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement between
or among any parties to any of the Financing Commitments or any definitive
document related to the Debt Financing and (C) of the occurrence of an event
or development that could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the
ability of Parent or Sub to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the terms and conditions, in the
manner or from the sources contemplated by any of the Financing Commitments or
the definitive documents related to the Debt Financing (or if at any time for
any other reason Parent or Sub believes that it will not be able to obtain all
or any portion of the Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments on
the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by
any of the Financing Commitments or the definitive documents related to the
Debt Financing). As soon as reasonably practicable, Parent and Sub shall

(including the Company Disclosure Letter) and the Confidentiality Agreement

understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein express or

hereto and such assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder, other than
in respect of the rights (i) of each indemnified party set forth in Section

and (iii) set forth in Sections 8.08, 8.11, 8.13 and the last sentence of

violation of this Section 8.09 shall be null and void.

SECTION 8.10. Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the
parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor and that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that
right, neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
It is accordingly agreed that, the Company and Parent shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
without proof of actual damages. The parties hereto further agree not to
assert that a remedy of specific enforcement by the Company or Parent is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
or that the Company or Parent otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that either the Company or Parent seeking
an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance
with this Section 8.10 shall not be required to provide any bond or other
security in connection with any such order or injunction. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) in the event that at the Closing Parent and Sub do not have
adequate cash resources to fund the Required Closing Cash Payments (whether as
a result of the proceeds of any external financing sources or otherwise),
Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions within their
control and otherwise use their best efforts to obtain such cash resources as
promptly as practicable, and (ii) the Company\'s rights to specific
performance under this Section 8.10 shall include the right to specifically
enforce Parent\'s obligations under clause (i) of this sentence.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and (ii)
the United States District Court located in the State of Delaware for the
purposes of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or the Transactions. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any action,
suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions in (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or (ii) the
United States District Court located in the State of Delaware and waives any
claim that such suit or proceeding has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that a final and unappealable judgment in
any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced by
suit on the judgment in any jurisdiction within or outside the United States
or in any other manner provided in Law or in equity. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not bring or support
any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any
kind or description, whether in law or in equity, against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing Commitment or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and
appellate courts thereof).

SECTION 8.11. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT
ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY
RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO 

REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 8.11.

SECTION 8.12. Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

SECTION 8.13. Non-Recourse. Subject to the rights of the parties to the
Financing Commitments, none of the Financing Sources (or any of their
respective former, current or future stockholders, partners, members,
controlling parties, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives), and no past, present or future director, officer, employee,
incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or
representative of any of the Financing Sources shall have any liability for
any obligations or liabilities of any party hereto under this Agreement or for
any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to the Financing Commitments, or the performance
thereof.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Sub and the Company have caused this Agreement to
be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized, all as of
the date first written above.
