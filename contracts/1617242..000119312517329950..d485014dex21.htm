ARTICLE II

 

THE MERGER

 2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Company will merge with and into Purchaser (the "Merger")
at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate
existence of the Company shall cease. Purchaser shall be the surviving
corporation (hereinafter sometimes referred to in such capacity as the
"Surviving Corporation") in the Merger and shall continue to be governed by
the Maryland General Corporation Law (the "MGCL") and its name and separate
corporate existence, with all of its rights, privileges, immunities, powers
and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

 

2.2 Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will take place by
the electronic (PDF), facsimile or overnight courier exchange of executed
documents or at a location and at a time as agreed to by the parties hereto on
the date designated by Purchaser within thirty (30) days
following satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing), or such later date
as the parties may otherwise agree (the "Closing Date").

2.3 Effective Time. In connection with the Closing, Purchaser and the
Company shall duly execute and deliver Articles of Merger (the "Articles of
Merger") to the Maryland Department for filing pursuant to the MGCL. The
Merger shall become effective at such time as the Articles of Merger are duly
filed with the Maryland Department or at such later date or time as Purchaser
and the Company agree and specify in the Articles of Merger (the date and time
the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

2.4 Effects of the Merger. The Merger will have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and in the MGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, from and after the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall possess all of the properties, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and be subject to all of the debts, liabilities and
obligations of the Company.

 



7 2.5 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Company Common Stock.

(a) By virtue of the Merger, automatically and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding at the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares, shall become
and be converted into the right to receive 1.191 shares (the "Exchange Ratio")
of Purchaser Common Stock (the "Merger Consideration").

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fraction of
a share of Purchaser Common Stock and no certificates or scrip therefor will
be issued in the Merger; instead, Purchaser shall pay to each holder of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share
of Purchaser Common Stock an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the average closing sales price of
Purchaser Common Stock on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC over the ten (10)
trading days ending on the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date.

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Purchaser Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or into a different class by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
combination or exchange of shares, or there shall be any extraordinary
dividend or distribution paid, the Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted
appropriately to provide the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(d) As of the Effective Time, each Excluded Share shall be canceled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no exchange or payment shall be made
with respect thereto. All shares of Purchaser Common Stock that are held by
the Company, if any, other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in
satisfaction of a debt previously contracted, shall be canceled and shall
constitute authorized but unissued shares.

 

2.6 Exchange Procedures.

 

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deposit, or shall
cause to be deposited, with Computershare, Inc. (the "Exchange Agent"),
pursuant to an agreement entered into prior to the Closing, for the benefit of
the holders of record of shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, for exchange in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, (i) the number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
sufficient to deliver the aggregate Merger Consideration and (ii) any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_, and
Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely deliver the Merger
Consideration. Appropriate transmittal materials ("Letter of Transmittal") in
a form satisfactory to Purchaser and the Company shall be mailed as soon as
practicable (but not later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective
Time to each holder of record of Company Common Stock. A Letter of Transmittal
will be deemed properly completed only if the completed Letter of Transmittal
is accompanied by one or more Certificates representing Company Common Stock
(or customary affidavits and, if required by Purchaser pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.6(i)_, indemnification regarding the loss or destruction of such
Certificates or the guaranteed delivery of such Certificates) representing all
shares of Company Common Stock to be converted thereby.

 



8 (b) At and after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall provide
to the Exchange Agent all information reasonably necessary for it to perform
its obligations as specified herein.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall (i) reserve for issuance
with its transfer agent and registrar a sufficient number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock to provide for payment of the aggregate Merger
Consideration and (ii) deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common Stock, an
amount of cash sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares.

(d) The Letter of Transmittal shall (i) specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent, (ii) be in a form and
contain any other provisions as Purchaser may reasonably determine and (iii)
include instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon the proper surrender of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed and
duly executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate, or, at the election of
Purchaser, a statement reflecting shares issued in book entry
form, representing that number of whole shares of Purchaser Common Stock that
such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(a) _and a
check in the amount equal to any cash in lieu of fractional shares such holder
is entitled to pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b) _and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled. Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as practicable (but not later than
five (5) Business Days) following receipt of the properly completed Letter of
Transmittal and any necessary accompanying documentation, the Exchange Agent
shall distribute Purchaser Common Stock and cash in lieu of fractional shares
as provided herein. The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or
exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the shares of Purchaser
Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall
receive and hold all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed
with respect to such shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto.
If there is a transfer of ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger Consideration
shall be issued to the transferee thereof if the Certificates representing
such Company Common Stock are presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by
all documents required, in the reasonable judgment of Purchaser and
the Exchange Agent, to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that
any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

 

(e) No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to Purchaser Common Stock issued pursuant to this
Agreement shall be remitted to any person entitled to receive shares of
Purchaser Common Stock hereunder until such Person surrenders his or her
Certificates in accordance with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. Upon the
surrender of such Persons Certificates, such Person shall be entitled to
receive any dividends or other distributions, without interest thereon, which
subsequent to the Effective Time had become payable but not paid with respect
to shares of Purchaser Common Stock represented by such Persons Certificates.

 



9 (f) The stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
immediately upon the Effective Time and from and after the Effective Time
there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer records of the Company of
any shares of Company Common Stock. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to Purchaser, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_.

 

(g) Any portion of the aggregate amount of cash to be paid in lieu of
fractions of a share pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.5_, any dividends or
other distributions to be paid pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ or any
proceeds from any investments thereof that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Company Common Stock for six months after the Effective Time shall be repaid
by the Exchange Agent to Purchaser upon the written request of Purchaser.
After such request is made, each holder of Company Common Stock who has not
theretofore complied with this  _Section_ __ _ 2.6_ shall look only to
Purchaser for the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect of each share of
Company Common Stock such stockholder holds, as determined pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.5_ of this Agreement, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to
this Agreement (or any Affiliate thereof) shall be liable to any former holder
of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(h) Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the
Companys stock transfer books to establish the identity of those Persons
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration, which books shall be conclusive
with respect thereto. The Company shall provide to the Exchange Agent all
information reasonably necessary for it to perform its obligations as
specified herein. In the event of a dispute with respect to ownership of stock
represented by any Certificate, Purchaser and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deposit any Merger Consideration represented thereby in escrow
with an independent third party and thereafter be relieved with respect to any
claims thereto.

 

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 2.5_.

 

2.7 Effect on Outstanding Shares of Purchaser Common Stock. At
the Effective Time, and except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5(d)_, each
share of Purchaser Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common
stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger.

 

2.8 Directors of Surviving Corporation After Effective Time. Subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.14_, immediately after the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, the
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall consist of the directors of
Purchaser serving immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



10 2.9 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The articles of incorporation of
Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the
articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended in accordance with applicable law and the terms thereof. The bylaws
of Purchaser, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law and the terms of such bylaws.

 

2.10 Treatment of Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock that is outstanding and unexercised
immediately prior thereto ("Company Stock Option") pursuant to the Clifton
Bancorp Inc. 2005 Equity Incentive Plan or the Clifton Bancorp Inc. 2015
Equity Incentive Plan (collectively referred to herein as the "Company Equity
Plans") shall automatically become vested and shall be cancelled and, subject
to Purchasers receipt of an option surrender agreement in the form set
forth in the Purchasers Disclosure Letter, converted into the right to
receive from Purchaser a cash payment in an amount, less required withholding
taxes, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the amount by
which $18.25 (the "Option Payment Amount") exceeds the exercise price of such
Company Stock Option. If the exercise price of a Company Stock Option is
greater than the Option Payment Amount, then at the Effective Time such
Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without any payment made in exchange
therefor.

 

2.11 Treatment of Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, any
vesting restrictions on each share of restricted stock outstanding
immediately prior thereto ("Company Restricted Stock") pursuant to the Company
Equity Plans shall automatically lapse and shall be treated as issued and
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for the purposes of this
Agreement, including but not limited to, the provisions of _Section_ __ _
2.5_.

 

2.12 Bank Merger. Concurrently with or as soon as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Kearny Bank, a wholly owned

parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective simultaneously with
or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

2.13 Alternative Structure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser may
specify that the structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
be revised and the parties shall enter into such alternative transactions as
Purchaser may reasonably determine to effect the purposes of this Agreement;
_provided, however,_ that such revised structure shall not (i) alter or change
the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, (ii) materially impede or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or
(iii) adversely limit or impact the qualification of the Merger as a
reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the IRC. In the event
that Purchaser elects to make such a revision, the parties agree to execute
appropriate documents to reflect the revised structure.

 



11 2.14 Absence of Control. It is the intent of the parties hereto that
Purchaser by reason of this Agreement shall not be deemed (until consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby) to control, directly or indirectly,
the Company or to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence
over the management or policies of the Company.

 

2.15 Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, Purchaser or Kearny Bank shall consider or be advised that any further
deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or
desirable to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in
Purchaser or Kearny Bank its right, title or interest in, to or under any of
the rights, properties or assets of the Company or Clifton Savings, or (ii)
otherwise carry out the purposes of this Agreement, Clifton Savings, the

vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Purchaser or Kearny Bank
its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or
assets of the Company or Clifton Savings or (b) otherwise carry out
the purposes of this Agreement, and the officers and directors of Purchaser
or Kearny Bank are authorized in the name of the Company or Clifton Savings or
otherwise to take any and all such action.

 

2.16 Withholding. Purchaser or the Exchange Agent will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Purchaser (or any Affiliate thereof) or
the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the IRC, or any applicable provision of U.S.
federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent that such amounts
are properly withheld by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent, such withheld
amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid
to the holder of the Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding were made by Purchaser or the Exchange Agent.

to _Section_ __ _ 3.2(j)_, for purposes of determining the accuracy of such
representations and warranties, all "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications
and other materiality qualifications contained in such representations and

corporation to transact business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction
in which the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the nature
of the business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing

Company engages only in activities, and holds properties only of the types,
permitted to savings and loan holding companies by the HOLA, and the rules,
regulations and interpretations promulgated thereunder.

(b) _Subsidiaries_.

(iii) The outstanding shares of capital stock of each Subsidiary have been
validly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. No

statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets,
and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements

ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information. To the

42 (s) _Properties_.

 

(i) Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to
all real property owned by it (including any property acquired in a judicial
foreclosure proceeding or by way of a deed in lieu of foreclosure or similar
transfer), in each case free and clear of any Liens except (i) liens for Taxes
not yet due and payable and (ii) such easements, restrictions and
encumbrances, if any, as are not material in character, amount or extent, and
do not materially detract from the value, or materially interfere with the
present use of the properties subject thereto or affected thereby. Each lease
pursuant to which Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries as lessee, leases real
or personal property is valid and in full force and effect as to Purchaser and
the Subsidiaries and neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor,
to Purchasers Knowledge, any other party to any such lease, is in default or
in violation of any material provisions of any such lease. All real property
owned or leased by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries are in all material

regulations and zoning laws and are considered by Purchaser to be adequate for
the current business of Purchaser and its Subsidiaries.

(ii) Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title
to all tangible personal property owned by it, free and clear of all Liens
except such Liens, if any, that are not material in character, amount or

material respects for good, valuable and adequate consideration in the
ordinary course of the business, in accordance in all material respects with
sound banking practices and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, the Loans are not
subject to any defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, including without
limitation any such as are afforded by usury or truth in lending laws, except
as may be provided by bankruptcy, insolvency or similar laws or by general
principles of equity. The notes or other evidences of indebtedness evidencing
such Loans and all forms of pledges, mortgages and other collateral documents
and security agreements are, in all material respects, enforceable and valid.

 

(ii) Neither the terms of any Loan, any of the documentation for any Loan,
the manner in which any Loans have been administered and serviced, nor the
Purchasers practices of approving or rejecting Loan applications, violate in
any material respect any federal, state, or local law, rule or regulation
applicable thereto, including, without limitation, the Truth In Lending Act,
Regulations O and Z of the Federal Reserve, the CRA, the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act, and any state laws, rules and regulations relating to
consumer protection, installment sales and usury.

 



43 (iii) None of the agreements pursuant to which Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries has sold Loans or pools of Loans or participations in Loans
or pools of Loans contains any obligation to repurchase such Loans or
interests therein solely on account of a payment default by the obligor on any
such Loan.

 

(u) _Anti-takeover Provisions Inapplicable_. Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries have taken all actions required to exempt Purchaser, the
Agreement, the Plan of Bank Merger, the Merger and the Bank Merger from any
provisions of an anti-takeover nature contained in their organizational
documents, and the provisions of any federal or state "anti-takeover," "fair
price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition" or similar laws or
regulations.

 

(v) _Corporate Documents and Records_. Purchaser has previously provided a

Purchaser and each of Purchasers Subsidiaries constitute a complete and
correct record of all actions taken by their respective boards of directors
(and each committee thereof) and their stockholders.

(w) _CRA, Anti-Money Laundering, OFAC and Customer Information Security_.
Kearny Bank has received a rating of "Satisfactory" or better in its most
recent examination or interim review with respect to the CRA. Purchaser does
not have Knowledge of any facts or circumstances that would cause Kearny Bank
or any other Subsidiary of Purchaser: (i) to be deemed not to be in
satisfactory compliance in any material respect with the CRA, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder, or to be assigned a rating for CRA
purposes by federal bank regulators of lower than "Satisfactory"; or (ii) to
be deemed to be operating in violation in any material respect of the Bank
Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, any order issued with respect to anti-money
laundering by the U.S. Department of the Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets
Control, or any other applicable anti-money laundering statute, rule or
regulation; or (iii) to be deemed not to be in satisfactory compliance in any
material respect with the applicable privacy of customer information
requirements contained in any federal and state privacy laws and regulations,
including without limitation, in Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999
and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the provisions of the
information security program adopted by Kearny Bank. To the Knowledge of
Purchaser, no non-public customer information has been disclosed to or
accessed by an unauthorized third party in a manner that would cause either
Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries to undertake any remedial action. The
Board of Directors of Kearny Bank (or where appropriate of any other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has adopted, and Kearny Bank (or such other
Subsidiary of Purchaser) has implemented, an anti-money laundering program
that contains adequate and appropriate customer identification verification
procedures that comply with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and such anti-
money laundering program meets the requirements in all material respects of
Section 352 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder, and Kearny
Bank (or such other Subsidiary of Purchaser) has complied in all material
respects with any requirements to file reports and other necessary documents
as required by the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder.

 



44 (x) _Internal Controls_. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries have devised and
maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting as defined in
Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and to
provide reasonable assurances that (i) transactions are executed in accordance
with managements general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets, and (iii)
access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or
specific authorization. There are no significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect Purchasers ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, there has occurred no
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in Purchasers internal controls over financial
reporting.

(y) _Tax Treatment of the Merger_. Purchaser has no Knowledge of any fact
or circumstance relating to it that would prevent the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from qualifying as a reorganization under
Section 368(a) of the IRC.

received the opinion (which, if initially rendered verbally, has been or will
be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same date) of Keefe, Bruyette and

Loan Property) (A) relating to alleged noncompliance (including by any
predecessor) with, or liability under, any Environmental Law or (B) relating
to the presence of or release into the environment of any Hazardous Material,
whether or not occurring at a Loan Property.

Hazardous Materials in, on, under or affecting such properties except for
releases of Hazardous Materials in quantities below the level at which they
were regulated under any Environmental Law in effect at the time of such
release. To the Knowledge of Purchaser, prior to the period of (A) Purchasers
or its Subsidiarys ownership or operation of any of their respective current
properties or (B) Purchasers or its Subsidiarys participation in the
management of any Participation Facility, there was no contamination by or
release of Hazardous Material in, on, under or affecting such properties
except for releases of Hazardous Materials in quantities below the level at
which they were regulated under any Environmental Law in effect at the time of
such release.

 

(bb) _Insurance_. In the opinion of management, Purchaser and its
Subsidiaries are presently insured for amounts deemed reasonable by
management against such risks as companies engaged in a similar business,
including engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, would,
in accordance with good business practice, customarily be insured. All of
the insurance policies and bonds maintained by Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
are in full force and effect, Purchaser and its Subsidiaries are not in

Intellectual Property owned by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries, the
owner possesses all right, title and interest in and to the item, free and

Property that Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries is licensed or authorized

valid, binding, enforceable and in full force and effect as to Purchaser and
the Subsidiaries. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
any charge, complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any interference,
infringement, misappropriation or violation with or of any intellectual
property rights of a third party (including any claims that Purchaser or any
of its Subsidiaries must license or refrain from using any intellectual
property rights of a third party). To the Knowledge of Purchaser, neither

have, a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Purchaser and Kearny Bank have

sentence by any officer, director or employee of the Company or any of

any of the covenants set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, (3)
the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation

requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.8(b)_ with respect to such new written
notice, except that the three (3) Business Day period referred to above shall
be reduced to two (2) Business Days. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
shall not submit to the vote of its stockholders any Acquisition Proposal
other than the Merger.

 

5.9 Registration of Purchaser Common Stock.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date hereof,
Purchaser shall prepare and file the Registration Statement with the SEC. The
Registration Statement shall contain proxy materials relating to the matters
to be submitted to each of Purchaser and the Company stockholders at the
respective stockholders meeting and shall also constitute the prospectus
relating to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
(such proxy statement/prospectus, and any amendments or supplements thereto,
the "Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). The Company will furnish
to Purchaser the information required to be included in the Registration
Statement with respect to its business and affairs and shall have the right to
review and consult with Purchaser and approve the form of, and any
characterizations of such information included in, the Registration Statement
prior to its being filed with the SEC. Purchaser shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the Registration Statement declared effective by the SEC and
to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is necessary to
consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby. Purchaser and
the Company each will use reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement-Prospectus to be mailed to its respective stockholders as promptly
as practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act. Purchaser will advise the Company, promptly after it
receives notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement
has become effective, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of the
qualification of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger
for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Registration
Statement. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating
to Purchaser or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers
or directors, should be discovered by Purchaser or the Company that should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to any of the Registration Statement
or the Joint Proxy Statement-Prospectus so that any of such documents would
not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and, to the
extent required by law, rules or regulations, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by Purchaser
with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the
Company.

 



60 (b) Purchaser shall also take any action required to be taken under
any applicable state securities laws in connection with the Merger and each
of the Company and Purchaser shall furnish all information concerning it and
the holders of Company Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall notify The Nasdaq Stock
Market LLC of the additional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to be issued by
Purchaser in exchange for the shares of Company Common Stock.

 5.10 Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt notice
to the other of: (i) any event or notice of, or other communication relating
to, a default or event that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
become a default, received by it or any of its Subsidiaries subsequent to the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time, under any contract
material to the financial condition, properties, businesses or results of
operations of each party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole to which each
party or any Subsidiary is a party or is subject; and (ii) any event,
condition, change or occurrence that individually or in the aggregate has, or
that, so far as reasonably can be foreseen at the time of its occurrence, is
reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to the other party of any notice or
other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.11 Employee Benefit Matters.

 

(a) Purchaser shall honor the Company Benefit Plans set forth in the
Companys Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms of such Company
Benefit Plans, except to the extent an alternative treatment is set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ or in _Sections 2.10_ or _2.11_ of this Agreement.
Following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall maintain or cause to be
maintained employee benefit plans and compensation opportunities for the
benefit of all Persons who are employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and whose employment is not
specifically terminated at or prior to the Effective Time (a "Continuing
Employee") that, in the aggregate are substantially comparable to the employee
benefit and compensation opportunities that are generally made available to
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries; _provided,
however,_ in no event shall any Continuing Employee be eligible to participate
in any frozen plan of Purchaser or its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) At the sole discretion of Purchaser, Purchaser may maintain the
Companys health and welfare plans through the end of the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Purchaser
determines to terminate one or more of Companys health and/or welfare plans,
then at the request of Purchaser made at least thirty (30) days prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall adopt resolutions, to the extent required,
providing that one or more of the Companys health and welfare plans
(excluding any plans that are mutually agreed to in writing between the
parties) will be terminated effective immediately prior to the Effective Time
(or such later date as requested by Purchaser in writing or as may be required
to comply with any applicable advance notice or other requirements 

 



61  contained in such plans) and shall arrange for termination of all
corresponding insurance policies, service agreements and related arrangements
effective on the same date to the extent not prohibited by the terms of such
arrangements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no coverage of any of the
Continuing Employees or their dependents shall terminate under any of the
Companys health and welfare plans prior to the time such Continuing
Employees or their dependents, as applicable, become eligible to participate
in the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries and their dependents and, consequently, no
Continuing Employee shall experience a gap in coverage. Continuing Employees
who become covered under health plans, programs and benefits of Purchaser or
any of its Subsidiaries shall receive credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid under the Companys health plan for the plan year in which
coverage commences under Purchasers health plan and shall not be subject to
any pre-existing conditions under any such plans. Terminated Company
employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Purchaser in accordance with COBRA.

 

(c) Purchaser shall cause each Purchaser Benefit Plan in which Continuing
Employees are eligible to participate to take into account for purposes of
eligibility and vesting under the Purchaser Benefit Plans (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual) the service of such employees with Company to the
same extent as such service was credited for such purpose by
Company; provided, however, that such service shall not be recognized: (i)
under the Purchasers ESOP, (ii) to the extent that such recognition would
result in a duplication of benefits under any of the Purchaser Benefit Plans,
or (iii) to the extent, at the sole discretion of Purchaser, the cash value
of unused paid time-off is paid to Continuing Employees at the Effective Time.
The value of each Company employees unused paid time-off is set forth in the
Companys Disclosure Letter. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit
the ability of Purchaser to terminate the employment of any Company employee
or to review any employee benefit plan or program from time to time and to
make such changes (including terminating any such plan or program) as
Purchaser deems appropriate.

 

(d) The Company shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause
the Company 401(k) Plan to be frozen as to future contributions effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time and Purchaser shall take all necessary
and appropriate actions to allow the Continuing Employees to participate in
Purchasers 401(k) Plan on the first day immediately following the Effective
Time. If requested in writing by Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days
prior to Closing, the Company will also take all necessary steps to terminate
the Company 401(k) Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to
the occurrence of the Effective Time, and if further requested, shall prepare
and submit a request to the IRS for a favorable determination letter on
termination. If Purchaser requests that the Company apply for a favorable
determination letter, then prior to the Effective Time, Company shall take
all such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser)
to submit the application for favorable determination letter in advance of the
Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use its
best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter as
promptly as possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to
the Company 401(k) Plan as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its
issuance of a favorable determination letter). Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company, and following the Effective

 



62  Time, Purchaser, will adopt such amendments to the Company 401(k) Plan to
effect the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(d)_. In the event Purchaser
requests the Company to submit an application to the IRS for a determination
letter, Company 401(k) Plan participants who are terminated at or after the
Closing, but prior to the receipt of the IRS determination letter, may elect
to receive a distribution from the Company 401(k) Plan upon termination of
their employment. Purchaser shall take any and all actions as may be required
to permit Continuing Employees to roll over their account balances in the
Companys 401(k) Plan into Purchasers 401(k) Plan. 

(e) Purchaser agrees that each full-time Company employee who is
involuntarily terminated by Purchaser (other than for "Cause" as determined
by Purchaser) or who voluntarily terminates employment for "Good Reason" (as
defined below) within six months following the Effective Time and who is not
covered by a separate severance, change in control or employment agreement
shall, upon executing an appropriate release in the form reasonably determined
by Purchaser, receive a severance payment equal to two weeks of base pay (at
the rate in effect on the termination date) for each year of service at the
Company, with a minimum equal to four weeks of base pay and a maximum equal to
twenty-six (26) weeks of base pay. For purposes of calculating the number of
years of service, fractional years of service shall be rounded up or down to
the nearest full year. For purposes of calculating base pay, Company employees
who are paid on an hourly basis shall be deemed to have a base pay equal to
the employees average weekly compensation over the two months prior to the
termination date; provided that, in no event shall an employees base pay for
this purpose be less than the employees base pay with the Company as in
effect immediately prior to Closing. For employees whose compensation is
determined in whole or in part on the basis of commission income, "base pay"
shall include base salary or total hourly wages paid plus commissions earned
during the most recent twelve (12) months ended as of the date of termination
of employment. Purchaser will offer Clifton Savings employees whose jobs are
eliminated as a result of the Bank Merger priority in applying for open
positions within Purchaser and Kearny Bank. Any employee of the Company who
has or is a party to any employment agreement, severance agreement, change in
control agreement or any other agreement or arrangement that provides for any
payment that may be triggered by a termination, including a termination
following the Merger, shall not receive the severance benefits as provided in
this Section but will receive the payment specified in such agreement or
arrangement. "Good Reason" means a material decrease in the total amount of
the employees base salary below its level in effect on the Effective Date
without the employees prior written consent or a material geographical
relocation of the employee without the employees prior written consent, which
shall be deemed to mean relocation to an office more than twenty-five (25)
miles from the employees location on the Effective Date.

 

(f) Purchaser shall honor all obligations under the employment or change in
control agreements as set forth in the Companys Disclosure Letter, except to
the extent any such agreement is superseded or terminated as of, or following,
the Effective Time. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Company
shall obtain from Paul M. Aguggia, in the form included in Purchasers
Disclosure Letter, an executed settlement agreement (a "Settlement Agreement")
to accept in full settlement of his rights under his employment agreement, and
an 

 



63  executed non-competition agreement with Paul M. Aguggia in the form included
in Purchasers Disclosure Letter, to be effective as of the Effective Time.
Purchaser and the Company agree that severance payments which may be triggered
under the employment or change in control agreements entered into with
Christine R. Piano, Stephen Hoogerhyde, Patricia C. Hrotko, Michael Lesler and
Diane Scriveri will be calculated under the same methodology as the Companys
severance analysis attached to Companys Disclosure Letter (the amounts of
such potential payments to each executive to be specified in the Companys
Disclosure Letter). 

(g) Subject to the occurrence of the Closing, the Company ESOP shall be
terminated by the Company. In connection with the termination of the Company
ESOP and the merger of the Company with Purchaser, all accounts shall be fully
vested, all outstanding indebtedness of the Company ESOP shall be repaid by
delivering a sufficient number of unallocated shares of Company Common Stock
to the Company, immediately before the Effective Time, all remaining shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Company ESOP shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, and the balance of the unallocated
shares and any other unallocated assets remaining in the Company ESOP after
repayment of the Company ESOP loan shall be allocated as earnings to the
accounts of the Company ESOP participants who are employed as of the date of
termination of the Company ESOP based on their account balances under the
Company ESOP as of the date of termination of the Company ESOP and distributed
to Company ESOP participants after the receipt of a favorable determination
letter from the IRS. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all
such actions as are necessary (determined in consultation with Purchaser) to
submit the application for favorable determination letter in advance of the
Effective Time, and following the Effective Time, Purchaser shall use its
best efforts in good faith to obtain such favorable determination letter as
promptly as possible (including, but not limited to, making such changes to
the Company ESOP as may be required by the IRS as a condition to its issuance
of a favorable determination letter). The Company and following the Effective
Time, Purchaser, will adopt such amendments to the Company ESOP to effect the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.11(g)_. Promptly following the receipt
of a favorable determination letter from the IRS regarding the qualified
status of the Company ESOP upon its termination, the account balances in the
Company ESOP shall either be distributed to participants and beneficiaries or
transferred to an eligible tax-qualified retirement plan or individual
retirement account as a participant or beneficiary may direct.

 

(h) The Company shall cause Clifton Savings to take all necessary action to
terminate the Clifton Savings Bank Directors Retirement Plan at or
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 409A of the
IRC and to pay to each participant a lump sum amount equal to the benefit to
which such participant is entitled pursuant to the terms of such plan. The
Companys Disclosure Letter sets forth the names of all participants and an
estimate of the amount of each lump sum payment.

 

(i) The Company shall cause Clifton Savings to take all necessary actions
to terminate the Amended and Restated Clifton Savings Bank Supplemental
Executive Retirement Plan at or immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with Section 409A of the IRC and to pay to each participant a lump
sum amount equal to the benefit to which such participant is entitled
pursuant to the terms of such plan. The Companys Disclosure Letter sets forth
the names of all participants and an estimate of the amount of each lump sum
payment.

 



64 5.12 Indemnification.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall indemnify and hold
harmless each of the current or former directors, officers or employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party"), and any
person who becomes an Indemnified Party between the date hereof and the
Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement incurred in connection with any
actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or
pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors or was prior to the Effective Time serving at the request of any
such party as a director, officer, employee, trustee or partner of another
corporation, partnership, trust, joint venture, employee benefit plan or other
entity or (ii) any matters arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to the fullest extent such
Person would have been indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses pursuant to the Companys Articles of Incorporation and bylaws as in
effect on the date of this Agreement and as permitted by applicable law, and
Purchaser and the Surviving Corporation shall also advance expenses as
incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, _provided_ that
the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances if it is ultimately determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section_
__ _ 5.12(a)_, upon learning of any action, suit, proceeding or
investigation described above, shall promptly notify Purchaser thereof. Any
failure to so notify shall not affect the obligations of Purchaser under
_Section_ __ _ 5.12(a)_ unless and to the extent that Purchaser is actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure.

(c) For a period of six (6) years following the Effective Time, Purchaser
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance covering each Person currently covered by the Companys
directors and officers liability insurance policy with respect to claims
against such Persons arising from facts or events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to expend in the aggregate pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12(c)_
more than 250% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for such
insurance and, if Purchaser is unable to maintain such policy as a result of
this proviso, Purchaser shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is
available by payment of such time; _provided further_ , that Purchaser may (i)
request that the Company obtain an extended reporting period endorsement under
the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy or
(ii) substitute therefor "tail" policies the material terms of which,
including coverage and amount, are no less favorable in any material respect
to such Person than the Companys existing insurance policies as of the date
hereof.

 



65 (d) If Purchaser or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with
or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
liquidates, dissolves, transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person or entity, then, and in each such case,
to the extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so that such successor
and assign of Purchaser and its successors and assigns assume the obligations
set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.12_.

(e) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.12_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and his or
her representatives.

 

(f) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.12
_are subject to and conditioned upon their compliance with Section 18(k) of
the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1828(k)) and the regulations
promulgated thereunder by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (12 C.F.R.
Part 359).

the opportunity to participate at the Purchasers own expense in the defense
or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no

(i) increase the size of its Board of Directors by three (3) members and (ii)

all such steps as may be required to cause any acquisitions of Purchaser
Common Stock resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by
each director or officer of the Company who becomes subject to the reporting

(g) by the Company, if Purchaser shall have breached its obligations under
_Section_ __ _ 5.8_ in any material respect;

(h) by the Company, at any time prior to the adoption and approval of this
Agreement by the Companys stockholders, to enter into an agreement with

exercise its termination right pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(i)_, it
shall give written notice to Purchaser (provided that such notice of election
to terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period). During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such

Index Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Purchaser
Ratio. If Purchaser so elects within such five-day period, it shall give
prompt written notice to the Company of such election and the
revised Exchange Ratio, whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant

modified).

matter hereof and supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter
hereof, other than, if the Stockholder is an officer of the Company,
with respect to any employment agreement between the Stockholder and the
Company or its affiliates. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to or shall confer upon any person not a party to this Agreement any
right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise and shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each

agrees that this Agreement is intended to be legally binding and specifically
enforceable pursuant to its terms and that Purchaser would be irreparably

accordance with its specific terms and that monetary damages would not provide
adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the Stockholder of any covenant or obligation contained
in this Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which Purchaser may be
entitled (including monetary damages), Purchaser shall be entitled to seek
injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, and the
Stockholder hereby waives any defense in any action for specific performance
or an injunction or other equitable relief that a remedy at law would be
adequate. The Stockholder further agrees that neither Purchaser nor any other
person or entity shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or
similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any
remedy referred to in this paragraph, and the Stockholder irrevocably waives
any right he or she may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting
of any such bond or similar instrument.

unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect

such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof
shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable.

amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed (a) in the case of an amendment, by Purchaser and the Stockholder, and

effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single
or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
