AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

This AMENDED AND RESTATED AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ")
is made and entered into as of June 28, 2011, by and among SuccessFactors,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Acquirer_ "), Puma Merger Sub Corp., a
Delaware corporation and directly wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer (" _Sub
I_ "), Puma Merger Sub I LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and
directly wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer (" _Sub II_ ," and together with
Sub I, " _Merger Subs_ "), Plateau Systems, Ltd., a Delaware corporation (the
" _Company_ "), Plateau Systems Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("
_Holdco_ "), and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as the Stockholders Agent (as
defined in _Section 8.7_). The capitalized terms used but not defined in
this Agreement have the definitions ascribed to such terms in _Exhibit A_
hereto.

 

RECITALS

A. The parties hereto have previously entered into an Agreement and Plan of
Merger (the " _Original Agreement_ ") dated as of April 26, 2011 (the "
_Agreement Date_ ") and desire to amend certain provisions of the Original
Agreement and to amend and restate the Original Agreement.

B. Following the execution of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
as part of the overall transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Holdco and the Company
shall convert into a single member Delaware limited liability company pursuant
to Section 266 of the DGCL (the " _Restructuring_ ") in a transaction that is
intended to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(F) of the Code. Pursuant to the Restructuring, all shares of Company
Capital Stock, Company Options, Company Warrants and other Company Rights will
be cancelled and converted, at the effective time of the Restructuring, into
an equivalent number of shares of Holdco Capital Stock, Holdco Options, Holdco
Warrants and other Holdco Rights.

C. The respective Boards of Directors and Board of Managers of each of the
Company, Acquirer, Sub I and Sub II (or, with respect to Acquirer, a duly
authorized committee of its Board of Directors) have approved this Agreement
and deems it advisable and in the best interests of their respective equity
holders that Acquirer acquire the Company through the statutory merger of Sub
I with and into Holdco following the Restructuring, pursuant to which Holdco
would become a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Acquirer and the Company
would become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer (the " _First
Merger_ "), and, as part of the same overall transaction, the
surviving entity of the First Merger, Holdco, would merge, immediately after
the First Merger, with and into Sub II (the " _Second Merger_ ," and together
with the First Merger, the " _Merger_ "), with Sub II to survive the Merger
and continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer and the Company to
continue as a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Sub II and as an indirect
wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer, all on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and, in furtherance thereof, have
approved the Merger, this Agreement and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

D. It is the intent of the parties hereto that, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a)of the Code, and that this Agreement shall constitute a "plan
of reorganization" in respect of the Merger for purposes of Sections 354 and
361 of the Code.

 



1 ##### Table of Contents

  

E. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, after the consummation of the
Restructuring, (i) all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of
Holdco shall be converted into the right to receive cash and shares of
Acquirer Common Stock in the manner set forth herein, and (ii) the unexpired,
unexercised and outstanding options to acquire shares of capital stock and
restricted stock units of Holdco held by Continuing Employees shall be assumed
by Acquirer and converted into the right to receive an option to acquire
shares of Acquirer Common Stock, or restricted stock units of Acquirer, as
applicable, in the manner set forth herein.

F. The Company, Holdco, Merger Subs and Acquirer desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and other agreements in connection with
the Merger as set forth herein.

G. Concurrently with the execution of the Original Agreement and as a material
inducement to the willingness of Acquirer to enter into the Original
Agreement, each Company Stockholder listed on  _Exhibit B-1_ executed and
delivered to Acquirer a Voting Agreement substantially in the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit B-2_ (the " _Voting Agreement_ ").

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and other agreements contained herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties hereto hereby agree as follows:

ARTICLE 1.

Agreement, the Certificate of Merger in substantially the form attached hereto
as _Exhibit E-1_ (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, Sub I shall merge with and into Holdco, the separate
corporate existence of Sub I shall cease and Holdco shall continue as the
surviving corporation and shall become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer
(and the Company shall become an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquirer
as a result). Holdco, as the surviving corporation after the First Merger, is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _First Step Surviving
Corporation_." At the Second Effective Time, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E-2_ (the " _Second
Certificate of Merger_ ") and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the
Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (" _DLLCA_ "), the First Step Surviving
Corporation shall merge with and into Sub II, the separate corporate existence
of the First Step Surviving Corporation shall cease and Sub II shall continue
as the surviving entity (with the Company continuing to exist as a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Sub II and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Acquirer) (the surviving entity after the Second Merger, or its successor, is
sometimes referred to herein as the " _Final Surviving Entity_ ").

 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated in accordance
with _Article 7_ , the closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place (i) as promptly as practicable (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days) after the satisfaction or waiver of each
of the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ (other than those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) or (ii) as such other time and date
as Acquirer and the Company may agree in writing. The Closing shall take place
at the offices of Fenwick and West LLP, Silicon Valley Center, 801 California
Street, Mountain View, California, or at such other location as the Acquirer
and the Company agree. The date on which the Closing occurs is herein referred
to as the " _Closing Date_."

(f) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the
contrary, any Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to
receive the amount of cash and number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock
provided for in _Section 1.8_, but shall instead be converted into the right
to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to
any such Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to
payment thereunder for such shares shall receive payment therefor in
accordance with the DGCL (but only after the value therefor shall have been
agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). If, after the
Effective Time, any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as
Dissenting Shares, then any such shares shall immediately be converted into
the right to receive the cash payable and the number of shares of Acquirer
Common Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 1.8_ in respect of such shares as
if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares, and Acquirer shall issue and
deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as reasonably practicable
after) the applicable time or times specified in _Section 1.9(c)_, following
the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth in _Section 1.9(c)_,

such holder would be entitled in respect thereof under this _Section 1.8_ as
if such shares never had been Dissenting Shares. The Company (or Holdco, as
applicable) shall give Acquirer (i) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal
or purchase received by the Company or Holdco, withdrawals of such demands,
and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the
Company or Holdco and (ii) consult in good faith with Acquirer with respect to
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal or
purchase under the DGCL. Neither the Company nor Holdco shall, except with
the prior written consent of Acquirer (which consent shall not to be
unreasonably withheld), or as otherwise required under the DGCL, voluntarily
make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any claim or demand in respect of any Dissenting Shares.
The payout of consideration under this Agreement to the stockholders of Holdco
(other than to holders of Dissenting Shares who shall be treated as provided
in this  _Section 1.8_ and under the DGCL) shall not be affected by the
exercise or potential exercise of appraisal rights under the DGCL by any other
stockholder of Holdco.

(g) _Rights Not Transferable_. The rights of the Holdco securityholders as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time are personal to each such
securityholder and shall not be transferable for any reason otherwise than by
operation of law, will or the laws of descent and distribution. Any attempted
transfer of such right by any holder thereof (otherwise than as permitted by
the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null and void. 

(h) _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock will be
issued in connection with the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of Holdco Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction
of a share of Acquirer Common Stock (after aggregating for each particular
stock certificate representing Holdco Capital Stock all fractional shares of
Acquirer Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from
Acquirer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the
product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Acquirer Stock Price.

event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Closing), deliver to the
Exchange Agent (A) the shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable pursuant to
_Section 1.8(a)(ii)(B)_, and (B) cash in an amount sufficient to permit
payment of cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to _Section

Final Surviving Entity from any claims, rights, liabilities and causes of

_Article 1_ of this Agreement).

in an attempt to resolve any disagreement and any resolution by them shall be
in writing and shall be final and binding.

(f) If, after such ten (10) Business Day period, the Stockholders Agent and
Acquirer cannot resolve any such disagreement, then the parties shall engage
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC or another nationally-recognized auditing firm
reasonably acceptable to Acquirer and the Stockholders Agent that has not
performed work for, and is otherwise independent of, each of Acquirer,
Holdco, the Company and the Stockholders Agent (the " _Reviewing Accountant_
") to review the calculation of Company Net Working Capital. After review of
such calculation, the Reviewing Accountant shall promptly determine the
Company Net Working Capital (and the parties shall instruct the Reviewing
Accountant to make such determination within thirty (30) days following
submission) and such determination shall be final and binding on the parties.
In conducting its review, the Reviewing Accountant shall consider only items
in dispute, and shall base its determination solely on presentations of
Acquirer and the Stockholders Agent (i.e., no independent investigation).

(g) If the Company Net Working Capital, as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 1.12 (the  _"Final Net Working Capital"_ ), is in fact less than
(that is, more negative than) the Company Net Working Capital set forth in the
Company Closing Financials Certificate (the _"Estimated Net Working Capital"_
), then each Effective Time Holder (including holders of shares of Holdco
Common Stock issued upon the Conversion and shares of Holdco Common Stock
issued in respect of Holdco Options that are exercised prior to the
Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares and shares owned by Holdco) will
severally but not jointly, based on such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata
Share, indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer from the Escrow Fund for an amount
(the " _Negative Adjustment Amount_ ") equal to the lesser of (i) the amount
by which the Final Net Working Capital is in fact less than (that is, more
negative than) the Estimated Net Working Capital and (ii) the sum of (A) the
amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is in fact less than (that is,
more negative than) the Low End Net Working Capital Target plus (B) the
Closing Working Capital Positive Adjustment Amount, if any. The
Negative Adjustment Amount payable by the Effective Time Holders pursuant to
this _Section 1.12(g)_ shall be paid by delivery to Acquirer, following
written notice to the Escrow Agent, of an aggregate amount of Escrow Cash
equal to the amount of such Negative Adjustment Amount, if any.

(h) If the Final Net Working Capital is in fact greater than (or less
negative than) the Estimated Net Working Capital, then Acquirer will pay to
each Effective Time Holder (including holders of shares of Holdco Common Stock
deemed to have been issued upon the Conversion and shares of Holdco Common
Stock issued in respect of Holdco Options that are exercised prior to the
Effective Time, other than Dissenting Shares and shares owned by Holdco) such
holders Pro Rata Share an amount (the " _Positive Adjustment Amount_ ") equal
to the lesser of (i) the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is in
fact greater than (or less negative than) the Estimated Net Working Capital
and (ii) the sum of (A) the amount by which the Final Net Working Capital is
in greater than (that is, less negative than) the High End Net Working
Capital Target plus (B) the Closing Working Capital Negative Adjustment
Amount, if any. Fifty percent (50%) of the Positive Adjustment Amount payable
by Acquirer pursuant to this _Section 1.2(h)_ shall be paid in cash and
fifty percent (50%) shall be paid in the form of Acquirer Common Stock, with
each Effective Time Holder entitled to receive a cash amount equal to such
Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share of fifty percent (50%) such Positive
Adjustment Amount (rounded down to the nearest whole cent) and a number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata
Share of fifty percent (50%) of such Positive Adjustment Amount (with the
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable to each Effective Time
Holder pursuant to this _Section 1.12(h)_ rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock).

determined pursuant to this _Section 1.12_.

(i) In the event of a Positive Adjustment Amount (if any), the costs and

Company Balance Sheet and as will be reflected in the Company Net Working
Capital Certificate (i) arose in the ordinary course of business, consistent
with past practices, and represented or shall represent bona fide claims
against debtors for sales and other charges, and (ii) have been collected or
are collectible in the book amounts thereof, less an amount not in excess of
the allowance for doubtful accounts provided for in the Company Balance Sheet,
or in the Company Net Working Capital Certificate, as the case may be.
Allowances for doubtful accounts and warranty returns have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP consistently applied and in accordance with the Companys
and its Subsidiaries past practices. The accounts receivable of the Company
and its Subsidiaries arising after the Balance Sheet Date and before the

doubtful accounts and warranty returns determined in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and the Companys and its Subsidiaries past practices.
None of the accounts receivable of the Company and its Subsidiaries is
subject to any claim of offset, recoupment, setoff or counter-claim. No
material amount of accounts receivable is contingent upon the performance by
the Company or any Subsidiary of any obligation or Contract other than normal
warranty repair and replacement. No Person has any lien on any of such
accounts receivable, and no agreement for deduction or discount has been made
with respect to any of such accounts receivable. _Schedule 2.22_ of the

Subsidiaries accounts receivable in the aggregate and by customer, and

with the terms hereof by July 31, 2011, or (y) the California Commissioner
has denied Acquirers application for a California Permit following the
exercise of reasonable best efforts by Acquirer and the Company during the
Minimum Permit Period to appeal any such denial, Acquirer shall promptly
deliver to the Company and Holdco a written notice (the " _Election Notice_ ")

a valid private placement under Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities
Act.

(f) In the event of a Private Placement Election or Private Placement
Decision, as may be applicable, Acquirer agrees to enter into and to be bound
by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit
M_ (the " _Registration Rights Agreement_ ") _._ The Company shall file
the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement described therein and shall
otherwise perform all of its obligations in accordance with the terms of the
Registration Rights Agreement (the " _Automatic Shelf Registration Statement_
"). 

(g) In the event of (x) a Private Placement Election or Private Placement
Decision, as may be applicable, and (y) Acquirer fails to file with the SEC
and otherwise cause the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to become
effective (a " _Shelf Registration Failure_ ") by the Deadline (as defined in
the Registration Rights Agreement), then, Acquirer shall release (an " _Early
Escrow Release_ ") to the Company Stockholders (in the manner provided herein
for all releases from the Escrow Fund) Escrow Cash in an amount equal to five
eighth of one percent (0.625%) of the aggregate balance of Escrow Cash for
each calendar day beyond the Deadline that a Shelf Registration Failure
continues; _provided, however_ , that, notwithstanding anything of the
foregoing to the contrary (A) Acquirer shall not be required to release any
such Escrow Cash to the Company Stockholders for any day after the Deadline
that Ernst and Young LLP has not delivered (an " _Auditor Delay_ ") to Acquirer
any consent required to be filed (i) as an exhibit to the Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement or Acquirers Current Report on Form 8-K which will
contain the historical financial statements of the Company, or (ii) any
financial information in respect of Holdco reasonably requested by Acquirer
that is necessary for the preparation of pro forma financial statements
required pursuant to Regulation S-X that the Acquirer will include in the
Current Report on Form 8-K to be filed immediately prior to the filing of the
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, in each case under the foregoing
clauses (i) and (ii) that has not been provided by the Chief Financial Officer
of Holdco (or after the Closing Date, the former Chief Financial Officer of
Holdco), where the principal cause of such Auditor Delay is due to the
officers and/or board of directors of Holdco based on actions or the failure
to take necessary actions that occurred or did not occur, respectively, prior
to the Closing Date, and (B) the Company Stockholders reserve all other
rights and remedies the Company Stockholders may otherwise have against
Acquirer consistent with Section 10.9 herein for a Shelf Registration Failure
(" _Other Legal Remedies_ ") unless a Shelf Registration Failure continues
for less than forty eight (48) hours immediately following the Closing Date,
in which case the Company Stockholders shall waive and shall not otherwise be
eligible to assert any Other Legal Remedies against Acquirer in respect of a
Shelf Registration Failure. In the interests of clarity and to avoid
ambiguity, assuming for illustrative purposes that in the event the Closing
Date was at 4:00 pm ET on June 28, 2011 and the Escrow Cash on the Closing
Date was $43,500,000, then the following examples would reflect the rights of
the Company Stockholders with respect to a Shelf Registration Failure: (1) if
Acquirer filed and caused the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to
become effective on or prior to 4:00 pm ET on June 30, 2011, then there would
be no Early Escrow Release and the Company Stockholders would have no right to
assert Other Legal Remedies against Acquirer for a Shelf Registration
Failure; (2) if Acquirer filed and caused the Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement to become effective after 4:00 pm ET on June 30, 2011 but on or
prior 4:00 pm ET on July 8, 2011, then there would be no Early Escrow Release
but the Company Stockholders would have the right to assert Other Legal
Remedies against Acquirer for such a Shelf Registration Failure; (3) if
Acquirer filed and caused the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to become
effective after 4:00 pm ET on July 8, 2011 but on or prior to 4:00 pm ET on
July 11, 2011 (i.e. the first calendar day the SEC would accept a filing of
the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement following July 8, 2011), then there
would be an Early Escrow Release of $815,625 in the aggregate to Company
Stockholders (i.e. the elapse of three calendar days following the Deadline of
a Shelf Registration Failure) and the Company Stockholders would have the
right to assert any Other Legal

 Remedies against Acquirer for such a Shelf Registration Failure; and (4) if
Acquirer filed and caused the Automatic Shelf Registration Statement to become
effective after 4:00 pm ET on July 11, 2011 but on or prior to 4:00 pm ET on
July 12, 2011, then there would be an Early Escrow Release of $1,087,500 in
the aggregate to Company Stockholders (i.e. the elapse of four calendar days
following the Deadline of a Shelf Registration Failure) and the Company
Stockholders would have the right to assert Other Legal Remedies against
Acquirer for such a Shelf Registration Failure.

5.3. _Form S-4 Registration; Stockholder Approval_.

(a) In the event Acquirer delivers an Election Notice for a Form S-4
Registration pursuant to the terms of _Section 5.1_ hereof, as promptly as
practicable thereafter (but in any event within twenty (20) calendar days
thereafter, assuming timely receipt of the Closing Financial Statements and
all signatures, opinions and consents required for such registration
statement), Acquirer, Holdco and the Company shall prepare, and
Acquirer shall file with the SEC, a registration statement on Form S-4 to be
filed with the SEC by Acquirer in connection with the issuance of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Form S-4
Registration Statement_ "). The Form S-4 Registration Statement shall include
(i) a prospectus for the issuance of shares of Acquirer Common Stock pursuant
to the Merger, and (ii) an information statement of the Company and Holdco for
use in connection with the solicitation of the Company Stockholder Approval
(as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the " _Information
Statement/Prospectus_ "). The Information Statement/Prospectus shall include
all of the information required to be included in an Information Statement as
set forth in _Section 5.2_ hereof. Each of Acquirer, Holdco and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 Registration
Statement declared effective by the SEC under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing with the SEC and to keep the Form S-4
Registration Statement effective through the Closing in order to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the Company, Holdco and
Acquirer shall, and shall cause its respective Representatives to, fully
cooperate with the other party hereto and its respective Representatives in
the preparation of the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, and shall furnish the other party hereto with all
information concerning it and its Affiliates as the other party hereto may
deem reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the preparation of
the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, and
any amendment or supplement thereto, and each of Acquirer, Holdco and the

Company Stockholder Approval. Promptly upon receipt of the approval of
the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement from sufficient Company
Stockholders to secure the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company and
Holdco shall deliver evidence of such approval to Acquirer.

Statement/Prospectus shall comply in all material respects as to form
and substance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the information
supplied or to be supplied by any party hereto for inclusion or incorporation
by reference in the Form S-4 Registration Statement shall not, at the time
the Form S-4 Registration Statement is filed with the SEC or declared
effective by the SEC or at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated

5.6. _Confidentiality; Public Disclosure_.

 

(a) The parties hereto acknowledge that Acquirer and the Company have
previously executed a letter agreement with respect to
Confidential Information (as defined therein) dated January 21, 2011 (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") which shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with its terms. The Stockholders Agent hereby acknowledges
and agrees that the terms of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated
hereby and all matters related to Stockholders Agent duties hereunder and in
connection therewith constitute confidential information and any public
statement in relation thereto must only be made with Acquirers prior written
consent. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, the Stockholders Agent may disclose confidential
information (other than with respect to the matters set forth in _Section
5.2(i)_) to employees, advisors or consultants of the Stockholders Agent and
the Effective Time Holders, in each case who have a need to know such
information, it being understood that the foregoing communications do not
constitute "public statements" for the purposes of this _Section 5.6(a)_.

 

(b) The Company and Holdco shall not, and the Company shall cause each
Subsidiary and shall instruct each Company Representative not to, directly or
indirectly, issue any press release or other public statement relating to the
terms of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the
prior written approval of Acquirer, unless required by law and except as
reasonably necessary for the Company and Holdco to obtain the consents and
approvals of the Company Stockholders and other third parties contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing contained herein shall
prohibit the Company Representatives from announcing solely their roles with
the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby following
public announcement of the transactions by the parties hereto. In the event
that the Company, Holdco, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Representative is requested (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand, any informal
or formal investigation) by any Governmental Entity, or is otherwise required
by applicable Legal Requirements, to disclose any information the disclosure
of which is limited by the provisions of this _Section 5.6_ (collectively,
the " _Compelled Information_ "), the Company will notify Acquirer promptly
in writing such that Acquirer may, in its sole discretion and at its sole cost
and expense, seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy or, in
Acquirers sole discretion, waive compliance with the terms of this Agreement
with respect to such disclosure of information. In the event that no such
protective order or other remedy is obtained and Acquirer has been advised by
legal counsel that it is legally compelled to disclose the Compelled
Information, the Company, Holdco, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company
Representative, as applicable, may disclose the Compelled Information but will
furnish only that portion of the Compelled Information which the Company,
Holdco, any of its Subsidiaries or any Company Representative, as applicable,
is advised by counsel is legally required. Notwithstanding anything herein or
in the Confidentiality Agreement, (i) Acquirer and the Company shall mutually
agree on the content of any press release made on or prior to the Closing
Date in connection with this Agreement, including the press releases
announcing the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and (ii) following the Closing Date, Acquirer may make such other
public statements regarding this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby as Acquirer may determine is reasonably appropriate.

 5.7. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. Subject to the limitations set forth in
_Section 5.8_ and _Section 5.19_, each of Acquirer, Sub I, Sub II, Holdco

effective, in an expeditious manner, the Merger, the Restructuring and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including the satisfaction of the
respective conditions set forth in _Article 6_ , and including to execute and

consummation of the Merger, the Restructuring and the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

 5.8. _Third Party Consents; Notices_.

(a) At Acquirers request, upon reasonable advance notice, the Company
and Holdco shall, prior to the Closing, deliver all notices that are required
to be delivered, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
consents, waivers and approvals under each Contract listed on _Schedule
2.3(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereunder; _provided, however_ , that in no
event shall the Company or any of its Affiliates be required to pay any
consideration to obtain such consents, waivers or approvals.

(b) The Company and Holdco shall give all notices and other information
required to be given to the employees of the Company, Holdco or any
Subsidiary, any collective bargaining unit representing any group of employees
of the Company, Holdco or any Subsidiary, and any applicable government
authority under the WARN Act, the National Labor Relations Act, as amended,
the Code, COBRA and other applicable Legal Requirements in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

5.9. _Litigation_. Until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement or
the Closing, the Company and/or Holdco, as applicable, will (i)
notify Acquirer in writing promptly after it has knowledge of any Legal
Proceeding initiated by or against it or any of its Subsidiaries, or known by
the Company or Holdco to be threatened against the Company, Holdco any of
their Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors, officers, employees
or stockholders in their capacity as such (a " _New Litigation Claim_ "), (ii)
notify Acquirer of ongoing material developments in any New Litigation Claim
and (iii) consult in good faith with Acquirer regarding the conduct of the
defense of any New Litigation Claim.

Date and continuing until the earlier of the termination of this Agreement
and the Closing, the Company and Holdco shall afford Acquirer and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives, reasonable access during
business hours to (a) all of the Companys, Holdcos and each of its
Subsidiaries properties, books, Contracts and records and (b) all other
information concerning the business, properties and personnel of the Company,
Holdco or any of their Subsidiaries as Acquirer may reasonably request; 
_provided, however_ , that the Company reserves the right to deny access to
any material that the Company reasonably believes upon advice of counsel that
(i) such exclusion is reasonably necessary to preserve attorney-client
privilege or (ii) such disclosure would violate Legal Requirements, provided
that, the Company and Acquirer shall cooperate in good faith to design and
implement alternative procedures to enable Acquirer to evaluate any such
documents or information without causing a violation or loss of privilege
thereunder. No information or knowledge obtained by Acquirer during the
pendency of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.10_ shall affect or be deemed to
modify any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or obligation under
this Agreement. Following the Closing Date, the Stockholders Agent and its
accountants, counsel and other representatives shall have reasonable access,
during business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the Companys and
its Subsidiaries books and records (including Tax Returns filed and those in
preparation with respect to the Pre-Closing Period) and properties
and personnel for purposes of reviewing Tax Returns or defending any
indemnification claim to the extent that such access does not affect any
attorney-client privilege of any Acquirer Indemnified Person.

5.11. _Expenses_. Whether or not the Restructuring and/or the Merger are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby (including Transaction Expenses)
shall be paid by the party incurring such expense, _provided, further_ , that

the Final Adjusted Purchase Price according to the definition of such term.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Acquirer shall bear the costs of all filing
fees associated with the matters set forth in _Section 5.19_ (Regulatory
Approvals), including any filing fees payable by the Company or Holdco
pursuant to _Section 5.19(b)_.

5.12. _Employees and Contractors._

(a) The Company and Holdco shall cooperate and work with Acquirer to help
Acquirer identify employees of the Company, Holdco and its Subsidiaries to
whom Acquirer may elect to offer continued employment with the Company,
Holdco, such Subsidiaries or Acquirer. With respect to any employee of the
Company, Holdco or their Subsidiaries who receives an offer of employment from
Acquirer or the Company or Holdco, the Company and Holdco shall assist
Acquirer with its efforts to enter into Employment Documents with such
employee as soon as practicable after the Agreement Date and in any event
prior to the Closing Date, provided any such obligation of the Company to
assist Acquirer with respect to the Retention Employees and Key Employees
shall be subject to the requirements that (i) the terms of compensation and
benefits in such Employment Documents are substantially consistent with
compensation and benefits for such individuals set forth in _Schedule
5.12(a)-1_ (the " _Employment Benefits_ "), and (ii) all offers of employment
shall be made by Acquirer pursuant to applicable Employment Documents
materially consistent with the forms of Employment Documents set forth on
_Schedules 5.12(a)-2_ , _5.12(a)-3_ , _5.12(a)-4_ , _5.12(a)-5_ , _5.12(b)-1_
, _5.12(b)-2_ and _5.12(b)-3_ (the " _Employment Document Forms_ ", and
together with the Employment Benefits, the " _Employment Terms_ "), by no
later than three (3) weeks following the Agreement Date (the " _Employment
Offer Deadline_ "). Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, neither Acquirer nor
Sub I, Sub II, the Company, Holdco nor the Final Surviving Entity shall have
any obligation to make an offer of employment to any employee of the Company
or Holdco, provided in the event that Acquirer fails to provide offers of

substantially consistent with the Employee Benefits, and (ii) pursuant to
Employment Documents materially consistent with the Employment Document Forms,
by no later than the Employment Offer Deadline, to at least ninety percent
(90%) of the combined number of Retention Executives and Key Employees listed
on _Schedules 6.3(e)-1_ and _6.3(e)-2_ , as may be applicable, then in such
event, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied the Closing condition
set forth in _Section 6.3(e)_. With respect to matters described in this
_Section 5.12_, the Company and Holdco will not, and shall cause each of
their Subsidiaries not to, send any notices or other communication materials
to any of their respective employees that may adversely affect Acquirers
attempt to hire or retain such employees without Acquirers prior written
consent, provided (i) such consent such shall not be unreasonably be
withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (ii) the Company shall be entitled to
exercise reasonable judgment and make such communications as are reasonably
necessary to ensure that it can satisfy the Closing condition set forth in 
_Section 6.3(e)_. Effective no later than immediately prior to the Closing,
the Company and Holdco shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, terminate
the employment of each of those Company, Holdco and Subsidiary employees
who (i) have not received an offer of continued employment with the Company,
Holdco or Acquirer prior to the Closing Date (each, a " _Specified Employee_
") or (ii) have declined an offer of continued employment with the Company,
Holdco or Acquirer prior to the Closing Date (collectively, with the Specified
Employees, the " _Designated Employees_ "). Unless otherwise agreed in writing
by Acquirer, the Company shall cause the relationships of each of the Persons
listed on _Schedule 2.2(b)-2_ of the Company Disclosure Letter with the

or communications required by applicable Legal Requirements).

(b) Prior to the Closing, Acquirer shall provide to the Company the allocation
of (i) the New Restricted Stock Units for the Continuing Employees identified
by Acquirer in such allocation and having an aggregate value of $3,000,000
(based on the Common Closing Stock Consideration Amount Per Share), which
allocation shall be made in accordance with _Schedule 5.12(a)-1_ with respect
to the Key Employees, and shall identify the number of New Restricted Stock
Units to be granted to each other Continuing Employees identified by Acquirer
in such allocation, as applicable, and (ii) the Additional Restricted Stock
Units for the Retention Executives and for the Continuing Employees identified
by Acquirer in such allocation and having an aggregate value of $5,000,000
(based on the Common Closing Stock Consideration Amount Per Share), which
allocation shall be made in accordance with _Schedule 5.12(a)-1_ with respect
to the Key Employees and the Retention Employees, and shall identify the
number of Additional Restricted Stock Units to be granted to each other
Continuing Employees identified by Acquirer in such allocation, as applicable.
Prior to the Closing and in consultation with Acquirer, the Company or Holdco
shall grant New Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the form attached hereto
as _Schedule 5.12(b)-2_ and Additional Restricted Stock Units pursuant to the
form attached hereto as _Schedule 5.12(b)-3_ under the 2011 Equity Incentive
Plan attached hereto as _Schedule 5.12(b)-1_ for shares of Company Common
Stock according to such definitive allocation provided by Acquirer. Unless
indicated otherwise by Acquirer in writing, such Additional Restricted Stock
Units and New Restricted Stock Units shall (A) be issued solely to those
persons to whom Acquirer makes an offer of employment in the amount to be
provided by Acquirer, (B) vest, in the case of New Restricted Stock Units, on
an annual basis over the four-years following the Closing, and, in the case of
Additional Restricted Stock Units, on the eighteen (18) month anniversary
after the date the Merger becomes effective, (iii) be automatically settled
pursuant to the Equity Exchange Ratio upon such annual vesting date or
eighteen (18) month anniversary, as applicable, after the date the Merger
becomes effective, (iv) be issued without consideration, and (v) in general,
except as set forth in the form of RSU Agreement for the Additional Restricted
Stock Units attached as _Schedule 5.12(b)-3_ hereto, shall not provide for
acceleration of vesting upon any event.

(c) Acquirer shall be responsible for and shall cause to be paid any
severance or other amounts (excluding accrued compensation or benefits) paid
or payable by the Company (whether on or prior to or following the Closing)
arising from or relating to the termination of any Specified Employee, or any
other Designated Employee who did not receive an offer of continued employment
with the Company, Holdco or Acquirer prior to the Closing Date providing for
(i) a base salary at least equal to the base salary of such
Designated Employee that was in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (ii) benefits at least as favorable as those provided to similarly
situated employees of Acquirer. Such severance or other amounts shall be
excluded from the liabilities of the Company required to be reflected in the
Company Net Working Capital and shall not result in a reduction of the Final
Adjusted Purchase Price; provided however that, notwithstanding the foregoing,
Acquirer shall not have responsibility for any such severance or other
amounts payable to any Designated Employee who has been or would have been
terminated by the Company in the ordinary course of business prior the Closing
based on such employees material failure to meet performance standards set
by the Company.

5.13. _Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Closing Date, the
Company and Holdco shall terminate all Company Employee Plans intended to
include a Code Section 401(k) arrangement (unless Acquirer provides written
notice to the Company no later than five (5) Business

 



68 ##### Table of Contents

  

 Days prior to the Closing Date that such 401(k) plans shall not be
terminated). Unless Acquirer provides such written notice to the Company, no
later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company and
Holdco shall provide Acquirer with evidence that such Company Employee Plan(s)
have been terminated (effective no later than the day immediately preceding
the Closing Date) pursuant to resolutions of the Companys Board of
Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to
reasonable review by Acquirer. In the event that termination of the Companys
401(k) Plan would reasonably be anticipated to trigger liquidation
charges, surrender charges or other fees then the Company and Holdco shall
take such actions as are necessary to reasonably estimate the amount of such
charges and/or fees and provide such estimate in writing to Acquirer no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, Acquirer
shall enroll the Continuing Employees in Acquirers (or its Affiliates)
401(k) plan and health and welfare employee benefit plans for which such
employees are eligible, including, but not limited to, its medical plan,
dental plan, life insurance plan, disability plan (the " _Acquirer Benefit
Plans_ "), but excluding for the avoidance of doubt its U.S. and non U.S.
equity compensation plans, U.S. and non U.S. incentive compensation plans,
executive compensation plans, executive compensation arrangements, other
pension plans (whether or not tax qualified) and its non U.S. benefits
programs, on substantially similar terms applicable to employees of Acquirer
who are similarly situated based on levels of responsibility, to the extent
permitted by the terms of the applicable Acquirer Benefit Plans.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this _Section 5.14(b)_ shall
not operate to (i) duplicate any benefit provided to any Continuing Employee
or to fund any such benefit, (ii) require Acquirer or its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or any Acquirer Benefit Plan or trust related thereto to pay for
any benefits that relate to any time period prior to the Continuing Employees
participation in the Acquirer Benefit Plans, (iii) require Acquirer to
continue to maintain any employee benefit plan in effect following the
Effective Time for Acquirers employees, including the Continuing Employees,
or (iv) be construed to mean the employment of the Continuing Employees is
not terminable by Acquirer at will at any time, with or without cause, for any
reason or no reason.

(c) To the extent permitted under the Acquirer Benefit Plans, Continuing
Employees shall receive full credit for service at the Company for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual (but not benefit accrual in any
defined benefit pension plan); provided that such credit does not result in
duplications of benefits.

 5.14. _Section 280G Stockholder Approval_. The Company and Holdco shall
solicit, and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, written consents
executed by such number of eligible Company Stockholders as is required by the
terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the " _280G Vote_ "), with such
stockholder approval or non-approval to be obtained in a manner which
satisfies all applicable requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations thereunder, including QandA-7 of Section 1.280G-1 of
such Treasury Regulations, so as to render the parachute payment provisions of
Section 280G of the Code inapplicable to any and all accelerated vesting
payments, benefits, options and/or stock provided pursuant to agreements,
contracts or arrangements that might otherwise result, separately or in the
aggregate, in the payment of any amount and/or the provision of any benefit
that would not be deductible by reason of 280G of the Code. In the event such
stockholder approval is not obtained, the Company agrees that none of such
payments or benefits shall be paid or provided pursuant to the Parachute
Payment Waivers. For the avodiance of doubt, receipt of stockholder approval
in respect of the 280G Vote shall not be a condition to Closing under this
Agreement.

 

5.15. _Parachute Payment Waivers_. The Company and Holdco shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Acquirer, prior to the
initiation of the requisite stockholder approval procedure under _Section
5.14_, a Parachute Payment Waiver in substantially the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit L_ (the 

 



69 ##### Table of Contents

  

 " _Parachute Payment Waiver_ ") from each Person who the Company reasonably
believes is, with respect to the Company, any Subsidiary and/or any ERISA
Affiliate, a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder), as determined
immediately prior to the initiation of the requisite stockholder approval
procedure under  _Section 5.14_, and who might otherwise have, receive or
have the right or entitlement to receive a parachute payment under Section
280G of the Code. The Company shall inform each such Person of the Tax
consequences to such Person of the failure to delivery such Parachute Payment
Waiver for the purpose of having such Persons parachute payment submitted to
the Company stockholders for approval, including the intention of Acquirer to
withhold all required Taxes, including excise taxes, on any parachute
payments payable to such Person in connection with the Merger. For the
avoidance of doubt, receipt of Parachute Payment Waivers shall not be a
condition to Closing under this Agreement.

 

5.16. _Assumption of Options, Additional Restricted Stock Units, New
Restricted Stock Units and Related Matters_. 

(a) At the Effective Time, each Holdco Option held by a Continuing Employee
that is unexpired, unexercised and outstanding as of the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, shall, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, be assumed and converted by Acquirer pursuant to
this _Section 5.16_. Each such Holdco Option so assumed by Acquirer under
this Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including, if applicable, the vesting arrangements and other terms
and conditions set forth in the Holdco Option Plan and the applicable
stock option agreement) as are in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time (as such may be amended by any offer letter or employment agreement
provided by Acquirer to such Holdco Optionholder, as applicable), except that
(i) such option shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of
Acquirer Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the next whole
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock, with no cash being payable for any
fractional share eliminated by such rounding) of the number of shares of
Holdco Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such option
immediately prior to the Effective Time and the Equity Exchange Ratio, (ii)
the per share exercise price for the shares of Acquirer Common Stock issuable
upon exercise of such assumed option shall be equal to the quotient (rounded
up to the next whole cent) obtained by dividing the exercise price per share
of Holdco Common Stock at which such option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time by the Equity Exchange Ratio, and (iii) no assumed
option may be "early exercised" ( _i.e._ , an assumed option may be exercised
for shares of Acquirer Common Stock only to the extent the assumed option is
vested at the time of exercise pursuant to the applicable vesting schedule).
It is the intent of the parties that to the extent permitted by applicable
Legal Requirements, all assumed Holdco Options in respect of Holdco Options
that prior to the Effective Time were treated as incentive or non-qualified
stock options under the Code shall from and after the Effective Time continue
to be treated as incentive or non-qualified stock options, respectively, under
the Code. Consistent with the terms of the Holdco Option Plan and the
documents governing the outstanding options under such plan as in effect on
the Agreement Date, the Merger shall not terminate any of the outstanding
Holdco Options under such plan or accelerate the exercisability or vesting of
such options or the shares of Acquirer Common Stock which shall be subject to
those options upon Acquirers assumption of those options in the Merger.

(b) At the Effective Time, each Additional Restricted Stock Unit and New
Restricted Stock Unit held by a Continuing Employee that is unexpired and

reasonably cooperate with and assist Acquirer in the preparation of such
registration statement. The Form S-8 registration statement shall not cover

entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with any Governmental
Entity in connection with the GSA Disclosures prior to the Closing shall
require the prior written consent of Acquirer, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and any such settlement shall,

(ii) there shall have been a Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquirer
and such Material Adverse Effect with respect to Acquirer shall not have been
cured within twenty (20) days after receipt by Acquirer of written notice
of such Material Adverse Effect (provided, however, that no such cure period
shall be available or applicable to any such Material Adverse Effect with
respect to Acquirer which by its nature cannot be cured).

ARTICLE 8.

Escrow Fund and Indemnification

8.1. _Escrow Fund_. At the Effective Time, Acquirer will withhold from the
cash issuable to each Effective Time Holder in the Merger such Effective Time
Holders Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Cash (such aggregate amount of cash
being referred to herein as the " _Escrow Fund_ "). Subject to  _Section
8.4_ below, the Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate Acquirer (on
behalf of itself or any other Acquirer Indemnified Person (as such term is
defined in _Section 8.2_ below)) for Indemnifiable Damages (as such term is
defined in _Section 8.2_ below) pursuant to the indemnification obligations
of the Effective Time Holders set forth herein. No portion (nor all) of the
Escrow Fund, nor any beneficial interest therein, may be pledged, subjected
to any Encumbrance, sold, assigned or transferred, by any Effective Time
Holder, or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process in
satisfaction of any debt or other Liability of any Effective Time Holder, in
each case prior to the disbursement of the Escrow Fund to any Effective Time
Holder in accordance with _Section  8.4(a)_ below.

8.2. _Indemnification_. From and after the Closing, subject to
the limitations set forth in this _Article 8_ and _Section 10.1(a)_, the
Effective Time Holders shall severally, but not jointly, based on such
Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share, indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer
and its officers, directors, agents and employees, and each Person, if any,
who controls or may control Acquirer within the meaning of the Securities Act
(each of the foregoing being referred to individually as an " _Acquirer
Indemnified Person_ " and collectively as " _Acquirer Indemnified Persons_ ")
from and against any and all losses, debts, obligations, liabilities1,
damages, fees, interest, costs and expenses, including costs of investigation
and defense and reasonable fees and expenses of lawyers, experts and other
professionals, directly or indirectly, whether or not due to a third-party
claim, incurred by an Acquirer Indemnified Person (collectively, "
_Indemnifiable Damages_ "), arising out of, resulting from or in connection
with (i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in
this Agreement, or of any factual statement contained in the Company
Disclosure Letter (solely to the extent the Company Disclosure

 Letter expressly states that such factual statement shall be deemed to be or
constitute a representation and warranty), to be true and correct as of the
Agreement Date and as of the Closing Date as though such representation or
warranty were made as of the Closing Date (except in the case of
representations and warranties which by their terms speak only as of a
specific date or dates, which representations and warranties shall be true
and correct as of such date), (ii) any breach of or default in connection
with any of the covenants or agreements made by the Company in this Agreement,
(iii) any payments paid with respect to Dissenting Shares to the extent that
such payments, in the aggregate, exceed the value of the amounts that
otherwise would have been payable pursuant to _Section 1.8(a)_ upon the
exchange of such Dissenting Shares, and any reasonable interest, costs,
expenses and fees incurred by any Acquirer Indemnified Person in connection
with the exercise of any appraisal rights, (iv) any inaccuracies in the
Spreadsheet, (v) any Indemnifiable Transaction Expenses, and (vi) GSA Contract
Liabilities and GSA Expenses subject to and in accordance with this _Article
8_. Each Effective Time Holder shall also severally, and not jointly,
indemnify and hold harmless the Acquirer Indemnified Persons from and against
any and all Indemnifiable Damages directly or indirectly, whether or not due
to a third-party claim, arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
the failure of such Effective Time Holder to have good and valid title to the
shares of Company Capital Stock as set forth in the Spreadsheet. Materiality
qualifications, and qualifications by reference to the defined term "
_Material Adverse Effect_ ", in any representation or warranty shall be taken
into account in determining whether a failure of any representation or
warranty to be true and correct exists but shall not be taken into account
solely in determining the amount of any Indemnifiable Damages for failure of
such representation and warranty (with such qualifications taken into
account) to be true and correct.

8.3. _Threshold; Other Limitations_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, no Acquirer
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to receive any amounts in respect of any
claim for indemnification that is made pursuant to clause _(i)_ of the first
sentence of _Section 8.2_ (the failure of any representation and warranty to
be true and correct) (other than in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach or a failure of a representation or
warranty contained in clause (ii) of the first sentence of _Section 2.22_
(Accounts Receivable)) unless and until the Acquirer Indemnified Persons have
incurred, as to all matters giving rise to indemnification under clause (i) of
_Section 8.2_, Indemnifiable Damages (as determined in accordance with the
provisions of this _Article 8_ ) in an aggregate amount greater
than $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), after which the Acquirer Indemnified
Person may receive Escrow Cash from the Escrow Fund equal to the amount of all
Indemnifiable Damages (including the amount of the Threshold).

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no Acquirer
Indemnified Person may recover any Indemnifiable Damages for (a) the value,
condition or diminution of any Tax attribute (e.g., net operating loss
carryforward or tax credit carryforward) of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
(b) the ability of Acquirer, the Company or their Subsidiaries to
utilize such Tax attribute following the Closing.

(c) Following the Effective Time, the sole and exclusive liability
and responsibility of the Effective Time Holders to the Acquirer Indemnified
Persons under or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including for any breach of
representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or obligation or
for any other reason), and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Acquirer
Indemnified Persons with respect to any of the foregoing, shall be as set
forth in this _Article 8_.

 



81 ##### Table of Contents

  

(d) If the Merger is consummated, recovery from the Escrow Fund (and with
respect to GSA Contract Liabilities, the GSA Escrow Fund as provided herein)
shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Acquirer Indemnified
Persons under or in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (including for any breach of
representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or obligation or
for any other reason), except (i) in the case of fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach by any Person, and (ii) any failure of
any of the representations and warranties contained in _Section 2.2(a)_, (
_b)(i)_ and _(iii)_ , _(d)_ and _(e)_ (Capital Structure), _Section 2.3(a)_
(Authority) or  _Section 2.12_ (Taxes) (collectively, the " _Company
Fundamental Representations_ ") to be true and correct as aforesaid, or (iii)
with respect to an Acquirer Debarment. In the case of fraud,
intentional misrepresentation, willful breach, any failure of any of the
Company Fundamental Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or any
Acquirer Debarment, after Acquirer Indemnified Persons have exhausted or made
claims upon the Escrow Fund (with the Acquirer Indemnified Person being
required to first resort to the Escrow Fund), each Effective Time Holder shall
be severally, but not jointly, liable in an amount equal to the amount of any
Indemnifiable Damages resulting from such fraud, willful breach, failure of
the Company Fundamental Representations to be true and correct as aforesaid or
Acquirer Debarment multiplied by such holders Pro Rata Share. In no event
shall the aggregate liability for all Indemnifiable Damages (including
Indemnifiable Damages recovered from the Escrow Fund) under this Agreement
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, Indemnifiable Damages resulting from
fraud, intentional misrepresentation or willful breach of this Agreement or
failure of the Fundamental Representations to be true and correct as
aforesaid, or an Acquirer Debarment) (A) with respect to any Effective Time
Holder, exceed such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share of the Final
Adjusted Purchase Price, and (B) with respect to all of the Effective Time
Holders, exceed the Final Adjusted Purchase Price received by such Effective
Time Holders.

(e) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of
any Indemnifiable Damages incurred or suffered by an Acquirer Indemnified
Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds
actually received by the Acquirer Indemnified Persons (or any of their
Affiliates) with respect to such Indemnifiable Damages and (ii) any amounts
actually recovered by the Acquirer Indemnified Persons (or any of their
Affiliates) from any other third party (in each case, net of the costs and
expenses of pursuing and collecting such insurance proceeds or amounts from
such third parties, and net of any insurance premium increases); _provided,
however,_  that nothing set forth in this _Section 8.3(d)_ shall be deemed
to require or obligate any Acquirer Indemnified Person to seek or continue to
pursue recovery under any insurance policy or against any other third party
with respect to any amount of Indemnifiable Damages.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Indemnifiable Damages
shall exclude punitive damages except to the extent such punitive damages are
payable to a third party.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event
will any Acquirer Indemnified Person have any right to indemnification for
(and Indemnifiable Damages shall not be deemed to have been incurred) for
Indemnifiable Damages (or portions of Indemnifiable Damages, as applicable)
with respect to any matter to the extent that such matter (and the
corresponding amount of Indemnifiable Damages in respect of which any Acquirer
Indemnified Person shall not have a right indemnification) is accrued
or otherwise accounted for in the calculation of "Company Net Working
Capital" or the merger consideration has been adjusted for such matter
pursuant to this Agreement.

(h) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event
that any Acquirer Indemnified Person receives any amount in respect of any
claim for indemnification in connection with the failure of a representation
or warranty contained in clause (ii) of the first sentence of _Section 2.22_
(Accounts Receivables) to be true and correct, and the receivables giving rise
to such claim are subsequently collected by or on behalf of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries on or prior to the Second Escrow Release Date
(Acquirer hereby agreeing that it shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to collect such receivables),
then Acquirer shall promptly after collection of such receivables deposit in
the Escrow Fund the full amount so collected, such amount to be included in
the Escrow Cash for all purposes of this Agreement.

8.4. _Period for Claims Against Escrow Fund_.

 

(a) Except as expressly set forth in _Section 8.4(c)_, the period during
which claims for Indemnifiable Damages may be made by any Acquirer
Indemnified Person (the " _Claims Period_ ") shall commence at the Closing and
terminate at 11:59 p.m. California time on December 17, 2012 (the " _Second
Escrow Release Date_ "); provided, however, that within five (5) Business
Days following 11:59 p.m. California time on the date that is twelve (12)
months following the Closing Date (the " _First Escrow Release Date_ "),
Acquirer shall instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse from the Escrow Fund to
each Effective Time Holder such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share of
fifty percent (50%) of the Escrow Fund, less the sum of (i) that portion of
the Escrow Fund paid to Acquirer prior to the First Escrow Release Date in
satisfaction of claims for indemnification in accordance with _Article 8_ of
this Agreement, (ii) that portion of the Escrow Fund that is determined, in
the reasonable judgment of Acquirer, to be reasonably necessary to satisfy
all unsatisfied or disputed claims for indemnification specified in any Claim
Certificate (as defined in _Section 8.5(a)_ below) delivered to the
Stockholders Agent prior to the First Escrow Release Date in accordance with
_Article 8_ of this Agreement, (iii) if potential GSA Contract Liabilities
have not been Finally Resolved with the applicable Governmental Entity by the
First Escrow Release Date, an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the higher
of (A) the Company Estimate of GSA Contract Liabilities, or (B) the
preliminary and reasonable estimate by Acquirer based on its investigation of
GSA Contract Liabilities to date, and (iv) a reasonable estimate of the GSA
Expenses to be reasonably necessary to be incurred to achieve Final Resolution
((iii) and (iv) collectively, the " _GSA Escrow Fund_ "). Acquirer shall
promptly release from the GSA Escrow Fund any such amounts held back in
excess of the final Acquirer Estimate of GSA Contract Liabilities delivered
pursuant to _Section 8.4(b)_ below. If potential GSA Contract Liabilities
have been Finally Resolved prior to the Second Escrow Release Date, then
Acquirer shall within five (5) Business Days following the date such
potential GSA Contract Liabilities have been Finally Resolved cause the Escrow
Agent to disburse to each Effective Time Holder such Effective Time Holders
Pro Rata Share of the amount of the GSA Escrow Fund less any amounts paid
from the GSA Escrow Fund following the First Escrow Release Date. Within five
(5) Business Days following the Second Escrow Release Date, Acquirer shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse to each Effective Time Holder such
Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share of the remainder of the Escrow Fund
less (i) that portion of the Escrow Fund paid to Acquirer after the First
Escrow Release Date and before the Second Escrow Release Date in satisfaction
of claims for indemnification in accordance with this _Article 8_ of this
Agreement, (ii) that portion of the remainder Escrow Fund that is determined,
in the reasonable judgment of Acquirer, to be reasonably necessary to satisfy
all unsatisfied or disputed claims for indemnification specified in any Claim
Certificate delivered to the Stockholders Agent prior to the Second Escrow
Release Date in accordance with this _Article 8_ of this Agreement, and (iii)
the GSA Escrow Fund. If potential GSA Contract Liabilities have not been
Finally Resolved with all relevant Governmental Entities by the Acquirer Audit
Deadline, then Acquirer shall instruct that the amount of the GSA Escrow Fund
less the amount of the Acquirer Estimate of GSA Contract Liabilities be
released to the Effective Time Holders (in accordance with their Pro Rata
Share) no later than the Acquirer Audit Deadline, provided, further, that such
GSA Escrow Fund, if any, held following the First Escrow Release Date, the
Second Escrow Release Date or the Acquirer Audit Deadline, as applicable,
shall only be available to compensate Acquirer or any other Acquirer
Indemnified Person for Indemnifiable Damages pursuant to clause (vi) of the
first sentence of _Section 8.2_. Any portion of the Escrow Fund held
following the First Escrow Release Date or the Second Escrow Release Date, as
applicable, with respect to pending but unresolved claims for indemnification
that is not awarded to Acquirer upon the resolution of such claims shall be
disbursed to the Effective Time Holders within five (5) Business Days
following 

 



83 ##### Table of Contents

  

 resolution of such claims. Within five (5) Business Days following the Final
Resolution of all GSA Contract Liabilities, Acquirer shall instruct the Escrow
Agent to disburse to each Effective Time Holder such Effective Time Holders
Pro Rata Share of the remaining portion of the GSA Escrow Fund not previously
paid to resolve GSA Contract Liabilities and GSA Expenses. Any claims for GSA
Contract Liabilities or GSA Expenses shall be made prior to the Acquirer
Audit Deadline.

(b) Acquirer shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to form,
as promptly and accurately as reasonably possible based on current
information, an estimate of the maximum GSA Contract Liabilities (the "
_Acquirer Estimate of GSA Contract Liabilities_ "), but by no later than the
date (the " _Acquirer Audit Deadline_ ") that is the earlier of (i) twenty-
one (21) months from Closing, or (ii) the completion of an audit of GSA
Contract Liabilities of the Company under Acquirers supervision by the GSA
Audit Firm with the assistance of any other appropriate legal or other
advisors to assist in such efforts, which audit shall take into account the
status of any government investigation and demands by the government prior to
the Second Escrow Release Date. The Acquirer Estimate of GSA Contract
Liabilities shall be based on the report of GSA Contract Liabilities as of the
Acquirer Audit Deadline prepared by the GSA Audit Firm and shall reflect the
reasonable estimate of the maximum liability that could be reasonably
demanded by or owed by the Company to Governmental Entities for GSA Contract
Liabilities incurred by the Company for activities prior to Closing, plus (1)
any outstanding amounts due for the GSA Expenses reasonably incurred after
the Closing but prior to the Second Escrow Release Date, and (2) a reasonable
estimate of the GSA Expenses to be reasonably incurred to achieve Final
Resolution of all GSA Contract Liabilities, provided all of the foregoing
amounts shall be subject to the GSA Expense Limitations.

(c) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Claims
Period for Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in
connection with claims with respect to (i) fraud, intentional
misrepresentation or willful breach by the Company, (ii) any failure of any of
the Company Fundamental Representations to be true and correct, and (iii) any
Acquirer Debarment, shall, in each case, commence at the Closing and terminate
upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 

(d) The availability of the Escrow Fund to indemnify the Acquirer Indemnified
Persons will be determined without regard to any right to indemnification
which any Effective Time Holder may have in his or her capacity as an officer,
director, employee, or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no
such Effective Time Holder will be entitled to any indemnification from
the Company or the Final Surviving Entity for amounts paid for
indemnification under this _Article 8_.

8.5.  _Claims_.

(a) On or before the last day of the applicable Claims Period, Acquirer may
deliver to each of (1) the Stockholders Agent and (2) Paul Sparta, in each

officer of Acquirer (a " _Claim Certificate_ "):

(i) stating that an Acquirer Indemnified Person has incurred, paid, reserved
or accrued, or that it reasonably believes it will incur, pay, reserve or
accrue, Indemnifiable Damages;

(ii) stating the amount of such Indemnifiable Damages (which, in the case of
Indemnifiable Damages not yet incurred, paid, reserved or accrued, may be the
maximum amount reasonably believed by Acquirer to be incurred, paid, reserved,
accrued or demanded by a third party); and

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Acquirer) the individual items of such Indemnifiable Damages
included in the amount so stated and the nature of the claim to which such
Indemnifiable Damages are related.

(b) No delay in providing such Claim Certificate within the Claims Period
shall affect an Acquirer Indemnified Persons rights hereunder, unless (and
then only to the extent that) the Stockholders Agent or the Effective Time
Holders are materially prejudiced thereby. At the time of delivery of any
Claim Certificate to each of the Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta, a
duplicate copy of such Claim Certificate shall be delivered to the Escrow
Agent by Acquirer (on behalf of itself or any other Acquirer Indemnified
Person).

(c) All reasonable GSA Expenses reasonably incurred by Acquirer shall be
subject to indemnification from the Escrow Fund or the GSA Escrow Fund,
subject to the applicable limitations set forth in this _Article 8_ and in
_Section 10.1_.

 

8.6. _Resolution of Objections to Claims_.

(a) If the Stockholders Agent does not contest, by written notice to Acquirer
(with a copy to the Escrow Agent to the extent the Escrow Fund is still in
place), any claim or claims by Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within
thirty (30) Business Days after any such Claim Certificate is received by
_both_ the Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta, then (i) the Stockholders
Agent will be deemed to have objected to the recovery by the Acquirer
Indemnified Person of any Indemnifiable Damages specified in the Claim
Certificate and (ii) the Acquirer may re-deliver (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent to the extent the Escrow Fund is still in place) to each of (i) the
Stockholders Agent and (ii) Paul Sparta, in each case in accordance with
_Section 10.2_, a copy of the Claim Certificate together with a notice (the
_"Second Notice"_ ) stating in bold, capitalized font at the top of such
notice: "THIS NOTICE CONTAINS A SECOND DELIVERY OF THE CLAIM CERTIFICATE. IF
THE STOCKHOLDERSS AGENT DOES NOT CONTEST, BY WRITTEN NOTICE TO ACQUIRER, ANY
CLAIM OR CLAIMS BY ACQUIRER CONTAINED IN THE ATTACHED CLAIM CERTIFICATE
WITHIN _[INSERT DATE THAT IS TEN (10) BUSINESS DAYS FOLLOWING RECEIPT BY BOTH
THE STOCKHOLDERS AGENT AND PAUL SPARTA OF THE SECOND NOTICE]_, THEN THE
STOCKHOLDERS AGENT WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE CONSENTED, ON BEHALF OF ALL
EFFECTIVE TIME HOLDERS, TO THE RECOVERY BY THE ACQUIRER INDEMNIFIED PERSON OF
THE FULL AMOUNT OF INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES SPECIFIED IN THE ATTACHED CLAIM
CERTIFICATE."

 

(b) If the Stockholders Agent does not contest, by written notice to Acquirer
(with a copy to the Escrow Agent to the extent the Escrow Fund is still in
place), any claim or claims by Acquirer made in the Claim Certificate within
ten (10) Business Days after any such Second Notice is received by both the
Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta, then the Stockholders Agent will be

recovery by the Acquirer Indemnified Person of the full amount of
Indemnifiable Damages specified in the Claim Certificate, including
the forfeiture of such amount of Escrow Cash equal to such Indemnifiable
Damages, and, without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a
final judgment for Indemnifiable Damages against the Effective Time Holders
for such amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue
is proper.

(c) If the Stockholders Agent objects in writing to any claim or claims by
Acquirer made in any Claim Certificate within the 30 Business Day period or 10
Business Day period above, as applicable Acquirer and the Stockholders Agent
shall attempt in good faith for 30 Business Days after Acquirers receipt of
such written objection to resolve such objection. If Acquirer and the
Stockholders Agent shall

 so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement shall be prepared and
signed by both parties. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively
rely on any such memorandum and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount
of Escrow Cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such
memorandum.

(d) If no such agreement can be reached during the 30 Business Day period for
good faith negotiation, but in any event upon the expiration of such 30
Business Day period, either Acquirer or the Stockholders Agent may bring suit
in the courts of the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United
States of America, in each case, located in the District of Delaware to
resolve the matter. The decision of the trial court as to the validity and

be entitled to conclusively rely and to act in accordance with such decision
and the Escrow Agent shall distribute such amount of Escrow Cash from the
Escrow Fund in accordance therewith.

(e) Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction.

calculations hereunder) and the Effective Time Holders will agree to
reimburse Shareholder Representative Services LLC for expenses incurred in
performing its duties as the Stockholders Agent in accordance with this
Agreement and the Stockholders Agent Agreement from the Advance Amount, and
(iii) the Significant Stockholders are designated on behalf of all of the
Effective Time Holders to communicate with, instruct and direct the
Stockholders Agent with respect to the fulfillment of its duties hereunder.
Each Effective Time Holder acknowledges and agrees that the Significant
Stockholders shall be permitted on behalf of all of the Effective Time Holders
to communicate with, instruct and direct the Stockholders Agent with respect
to any disputes, communications, correspondence, events, developments or
other occurrences that may occur following the Closing, and that no other
Effective Time Holder shall be permitted to direct or instruct the
Stockholders Agent absent agreement of the Company (prior to the Closing) or
the Significant Stockholders (following the Closing) to the contrary. By
virtue of signing a Letter of Transmittal or a Voting Agreement, each
Effective Time Holder irrevocably acknowledges and agrees to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, including without limitation the appointment of
the Stockholders Agent on its behalf in accordance with and subject to the
terms of this _Section 8.7_ and the indemnification of the Stockholders
Agent set forth in Section 8.7(e).

(c) The Stockholders Agent shall not be liable to any Person for any act
done or omitted hereunder as the Stockholders Agent while acting in good
faith (and any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be
conclusive evidence of such good faith) and without gross negligence
or willful misconduct.

(d) At the Closing, Acquirer shall cause the sum of two million dollars
($2,000,000) in cash (the " _Advance Amount_ ") to be wired to the
Stockholders Agent or such other Person as (i) the Company shall designate
prior to the Closing or (ii) may be designated by the Significant Stockholders
following the Closing (a " _Stockholder Designee_ "), which shall be held by
the Stockholders Agent or Stockholder Designee, as applicable, as agent and
for the benefit of the Effective Time Holders, in a segregated bank account
(the " _Expense Fund_ "). The Expense Fund shall be used for the purposes of
paying directly or reimbursing the Stockholders Agent, the Stockholder
Designee or other Persons acting or performing services on behalf of
the Effective Time Holders as designated by the Significant Stockholders, as
applicable, upon presentation of an invoice, for any third party expenses (x)
pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders Agent
Agreement or any written agreement that the Significant Stockholders may
enter into with a successor Stockholders Agent or the Stockholder Designee,
or (y) otherwise incurred by or on behalf of the Stockholders Agent or the
Stockholder Designee, in each case on behalf of the Effective Time Holders
and solely at the direction and approval of the Significant Stockholders, in
connection with disputes, communications, correspondence, events, developments
or other occurrences that may occur following the Closing, including, without
limitation, the defense of any claims brought by the Acquirer Indemnified
Persons for Indemnifiable Damages (the " _Stockholder Expenses_ "); _provided,
however_ , that Stockholder Expenses shall exclude costs, expenses, losses or
liabilities resulting from the Stockholders Agents or Stockholder Designees
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Stockholders Agent or
Stockholder Designee will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds,
will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate
purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors
in the event of bankruptcy. If held by the Stockholders Agent, the Effective
Time Holders shall not receive interest or other earnings on the Expense Fund
and the Effective Time Holders irrevocably transfer and assign to the
Stockholders Agent any ownership right that they may have in any interest
that may accrue on funds held in the Expense Fund. The Effective Time Holders
acknowledge that the Stockholders Agent is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice. The Stockholders Agent shall have no
responsibility or liability for any loss of principal of the Expense Fund
other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. As soon
as practicable following the release in full of the Escrow Fund under the
terms set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement, or at any time upon the
written direction of the Significant Stockholders in their sole discretion,
the Stockholders Agent or the Stockholder Designee shall deliver the balance
of the Expense Fund to the Exchange Agent for distribution to the Effective
Time Holders (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Share). For tax
purposes, the Expense Fund shall be treated as having been received by the
Effective Time Holders and voluntarily set aside by the Effective Time
Holders at the time of Closing. The parties agree that the Stockholders Agent
or Stockholder Designee is not acting as a withholding agent or in any similar
capacity in connection with the Expense Fund. If any tax reporting is
required with respect to the ultimate distribution of any balance of the
Expense Fund, then the Stockholders Agent or Stockholder Designee will
provide to Acquirer or its designated agent, upon request, information in
its possession regarding the amounts distributed to each Effective Time
Holder, to be used by Acquirer or its agent in completing any required tax
reporting. Any portion of the Expense Fund that remains undeliverable or
unclaimed after six months of the initial delivery attempt by the Exchange
Agent shall promptly be paid to Acquirer and handled in the same manner as
other unclaimed funds as provided in the Merger Agreement or Escrow Agreement.

 

(e) The Effective Time Holders shall severally but not jointly, based on each
Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share, indemnify, defend and hold harmless
the Stockholders Agent and its successors and assigns from and against any
and all claims, demands, suits, actions, causes of action, losses, damages,
obligations, liabilities, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees and court costs) (collectively, " _Representative Losses_ ") arising as a
result of or incurred in connection with any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by the Stockholders Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, the Stockholders Agent Agreement and any other ancillary
agreements contemplated

 hereby, in each case as such Representative Loss is incurred or suffered;
provided that in the event it is finally adjudicated that a Representative
Loss or any portion thereof was caused by the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of the Stockholders Agent, the Stockholders Agent will reimburse
the Effective Time Holders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss
to the extent attributable to such gross negligence or willful misconduct. If
not paid directly to the Stockholders Agent by the Effective Time Holders,
any such losses, liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the Stockholders
Agent from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund and (ii) the amounts in the
Escrow Fund otherwise distributable to the Effective Time Holders pursuant to
the terms hereof and the Escrow Agreement at the time of distribution in
accordance with written instructions delivered by the Stockholders Agent to
the Escrow Agent; provided that while this section allows the Stockholders
Agent to be paid from the Expense Fund and the Escrow Fund, this does not
relieve the Effective Time Holders from their obligation to promptly pay such
Representative Losses as such Representative Losses are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Stockholders Agent from seeking any remedies
available to it at law or otherwise. At such time as any amounts in the
Escrow Fund are available to be distributed to the Effective Time Holders,
the Significant Stockholders shall have the ability to use such funds to pay
any Stockholder Expenses that have been incurred or are otherwise payable in
lieu of such funds being distributed by the Exchange Agent to the Effective
Time Holders.

(f) If Shareholder Representative Services LLC at any time is removed as
Stockholders Agent by the Significant Stockholders or resigns, then the
Significant Stockholders shall appoint a successor Stockholders Agent by
notice to Acquirer. Upon the appointment of a successor Stockholders
Agent, such successor Stockholders Agent shall thereupon succeed to and
become vested with all the rights and duties of the removed or retiring
Stockholders Agent. If for any reason there is no Stockholders Agent at any
time, all references herein to the Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to
refer to the Effective Time Holders.

(g) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of, the Stockholders Agent that is
within the scope of the Stockholders Agents authority under _Section
8.7(a)_ shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent,
settlement, resolution or instruction of all the Effective Time Holders and
shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Effective Time Holder;
and each Acquirer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to rely exclusively
upon any such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within
a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction as being a notice or communication to or by, or a decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, each and every
such Effective Time Holder. Acquirer, the other Acquirer Indemnified Persons
are hereby relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by them
in accordance with such notice, communication, decision, action, failure to
act within a designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement,
resolution or instruction of the Stockholders Agent.

8.8. _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquirer becomes aware of a third
party claim which Acquirer in good faith believes may result in a claim
against the Escrow Fund by or on behalf of an Acquirer Indemnified Person,
then Acquirer shall deliver a Claim Certificate to the Stockholders Agent and
Paul Sparta (with a copy to the Escrow Agent) as promptly as practicable, but
in any event no later than fifteen (15) Business Days after receiving notice
thereof, which Claim Certificate shall specify in reasonable detail the nature
and amount of the claim and such other information as may be necessary to
determine whether the claim may be subject to indemnification hereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no delay on the part of Acquirer or any other
Acquirer Indemnified Person in delivering a Claim Certificate to the
Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta shall relieve the Effective Time Holders
from any obligation

_ _ hereunder unless (and then solely to the extent) the Effective Time
Holders are thereby materially prejudiced, subject to the applicable time
periods for making a claim set forth in  _Section 8.4(a)_ and _Section
10.1(a)_. Subject to _Section 8.9_ below, in the event Acquirer delivers a
Claim Certificate to each of the Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta for a
third-party claim, the Stockholders Agent shall have the right to conduct
the defense (at the sole expense of the Stockholders Agent and the Effective
Time Holders) of and to settle or resolve any such claim by delivering written
notice to Acquirer within thirty (30) Business Days following the later of
delivery of the Claim Certificate and delivery of the Second Notice. In such
case, any selection of counsel by the Stockholders Agent, and any settlement
of such claim, shall be subject to the approval of Acquirer, not to be
unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Stockholders Agent shall not have the right to conduct the defense of any
such claim under this _Section 8.8_ unless (i) the Stockholders Agent shall
has given notice to Acquirer that the Effective Time Holders will severally,
but not jointly, based on such Effective Time Holders Pro Rata Share,
indemnify and hold harmless Acquirer from and against the entirety of all
Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or in connection with
such third-party claim, (ii) the Stockholders Agent provides Acquirer with
evidence reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer that the Stockholders Agent
will have the financial resources to defend against such third-party claim,
(iii) the maximum of Indemnifiable Damages that may arise out of, result from
or in connection with will not exceed the amount of the Escrow Fund as of
such time, (iv) such third-party claim involves only money damages, does not
seek an injunction or specific performance, and does not seek any other form
of equitable relief that would be material to the business of the
Company, (v) such third-party claim will not, in the good faith judgment of
Acquirer, adversely affect the continuing business or business relationships
of any Acquirer Indemnified Party with any third-party, (vi) settlement of, or
an adverse judgment with respect to, is not, in Acquirers good faith
judgment, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice adverse to the
continuing business interests or the reputation of any Acquirer Indemnified
Party, (vii) the Stockholders Agent conducts at all times the defense of
such third-party claim actively and diligently and (viii) such third-party
claim does not relate to any Intellectual Property. In such case, or if the
Stockholders Agent does not elect to assume the defense of such claim within
such thirty (30) Business Day period, Acquirer shall have the right to conduct
the defense of and to settle or resolve any such claim (and the costs and
expenses incurred by Acquirer in connection with such defense, settlement or
resolution (including reasonable attorneys fees, other professionals and
experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be included in the
Indemnifiable Damages for which Acquirer may seek indemnification pursuant to
a claim made hereunder). The Stockholders Agent shall have the right to
receive copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to
the third-party claim to the extent that receipt of such documents does not
affect any privilege relating to any Acquirer Indemnified Person and shall be
entitled, at its expense, to participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
any defense of the third-party claim or settlement negotiations with respect
to the third-party claim. However, except with the prior written consent of
the Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, no settlement or resolution by an Acquirer Indemnified
Person of any claim that gives rise to a claim against the Escrow Fund by or
on behalf of an Acquirer Indemnified Person shall be determinative of the
existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages relating to such matter. The
Stockholders Agent will be deemed to have objected to such settlement or
resolution if the Stockholders Agent does not respond within thirty (30)
Business Days following receipt by _both_ the Stockholders Agent and Paul
Sparta of a written request from Acquirer for consent, in which case the
Acquirer may re-deliver (with a copy to the Escrow Agent to the extent the
Escrow Fund is still in place) to each of the Stockholders Agent and Paul
Sparta such request together with a notice stating in bold, capitalized font
at the top of such notice __: "THIS NOTICE CONTAINS A SECOND NOTICE OF A
WRITTEN REQUEST FOR CONSENT. IF THE STOCKHOLDERS S AGENT DOES NOT OBJECT, BY

THE STOCKHOLDERS AGENT WILL BE DEEMED TO HAVE CONSENTED, ON BEHALF OF ALL
EFFECTIVE TIME HOLDERS, TO THE SETTLEMENT OF RESOLUTION OF SUCH CLAIM AND SUCH
SETTLEMENT OR RESOLUTION SHALL BE DETERMINATIVE OF THE EXISTENCE OF OR AMOUNT
OF INDEMNIFIABLE DAMAGES RELATING TO SUCH MATTER." In the event that the
Stockholders Agent has consented to any such settlement or resolution,
neither the Stockholders Agent nor any Effective Time Holder shall have any
power or authority to object under _Section 8.5_ or any other provision of
this _Article 8_ to the amount of any claim by or on behalf of any Acquirer
Indemnified Person against the Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such
settlement or resolution. 

8.9. _GSA Claims_. After Closing, Acquirer shall control the defense of any
third party claim (including any Legal Proceedings brought by any
Governmental Entity) related to or arising out of any actual or alleged GSA
Contract Liabilities. Acquirer shall further control, following the Closing,
any disclosure process, remediation activities or other processes conducted
or engaged in by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to GSA
Contract Liabilities. Acquirer shall consult with the Stockholders Agent
and/or its designees with respect to any of the foregoing matters, provide
them with copies of correspondence and an opportunity to review and provide
comments on any draft correspondence and keep them reasonably informed with
respect to the foregoing matters and provide reasonable periodic access to
the GSA Audit Firm, with the presence of Acquirer, during the course of
Acquirers investigation of GSA Contract Liabilities, and copies of all
reports prepared by the GSA Audit Firm, and keep it informed of all
communications with the government regarding disclosures to any Governmental
Entity. Acquirer shall be permitted to resolve the GSA Contract Liabilities
(and/or make any acknowledgement of liability with respect thereto) with the
prior written consent of the Stockholders Agent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, provided, however, following a
period no longer than thirty (30) days from notice by Acquirer during which
the parties shall use reasonable efforts to reach mutual agreement with
respect to the proposed terms of such final resolution, Acquirer shall be
permitted to finally resolve such claims without the consent of Stockholders
Agent, but such final resolution shall not be determinative or otherwise
binding of the amount, if any, of the indemnification liability of the
Effective Time Holders for GSA Claims by Acquirer.

 

8.10. _Indemnification by Acquirer_. From and after the Closing, subject to
the provisions of  _Section 10.1(b)_, the Acquirer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each Effective Time Holder and its officers, directors,
agents and employees, and each Person, if any, who controls or may control
each Effective Time Holder within the meaning of the Securities Act (each of
the foregoing being referred to individually as a " _Stockholder Indemnified
Person_ " and collectively as " _Stockholder Indemnified Persons_ ") from and
against any and all Indemnifiable Damages arising out of, resulting from or
in connection with (i) the failure of any Acquirer Fundamental Representation
(as defined below) to be true and correct as of the Agreement Date and as of
the Closing Date, as if such Acquirer Fundamental Representation was made as
of the Closing Date (except in the case of Acquirer Fundamental
Representations which by their terms speak only as of a specific date or
dates, which Acquirer Fundamental Representations shall be true and correct
as of such date or dates), and (ii) any breach of or default in connection
with any of the covenants or agreements made by Acquirer in this Agreement.

ARTICLE 9.

 

Additional Tax Matters

 9.1. _Additional Tax Matters_.

(a) The allocation of Tax liability between the Pre-Closing Period and
the Post-Closing Period compromising a Straddle Period shall be made as
follows:

(i) in the case of Taxes based upon income, gross receipts (such as sales
Taxes) or specific transactions involving Taxes other than Taxes based upon
income or gross receipts, the amount of Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing
Period or Post-Closing Period included in the Straddle Period shall be
determined by closing the books of the applicable corporation as of the close
of the Closing Date and by treating each of such Pre-Closing Period and Post-
Closing Period as a period;

 

(ii) in the case of Taxes that are determined on a basis other than income,
gross receipts or specific transactions, the amount of Taxes attributable to
any Pre-Closing Period included in the Straddle Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Taxes for the Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the Pre-Closing Period included
in the Straddle Period and the denominator of which is the total number of
days in the Straddle Period, and the amount of such Taxes attributable to any
Post-Closing Period included in a Straddle Period shall be the excess of the
amount of the Taxes for the Straddle Period over the amount of Taxes
attributable to the Pre-Closing Period included in such Straddle Period; and

 

(iii) any deductions in respect of Company Options exercised in connection
with the Closing treated as compensation shall be treated as arising in the
Pre-Closing Period.

(b) Acquirer shall promptly notify _both_ the Stockholders Agent and
Paul Sparta in writing upon receipt by the Acquirer, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or the Final Surviving Entities of a written notice of any
pending or threatened Tax Proceeding for which the Effective Time Holders may
have liability pursuant to this Agreement; provided, however, any failure or
delay by the Acquirer to provide notice of a Tax Proceeding shall not reduce
or otherwise affect the obligation of the Effective Time Holders hereunder,
except and only to the extent that the Effective Time Holders are materially
prejudiced by such failure to give notice. The Stockholders Agent, at the
Effective Time Holders expense, shall have the right to participate in any
such Tax Proceeding. Acquirer shall provide the Stockholders Agent with
copies of all written communications, materials and submissions related to
such Tax Proceeding received from, or provided to, a Governmental Entity and
to have a reasonable opportunity to comment on any such written materials to
be provided to the Governmental Entity. Acquirer shall keep the Stockholders
Agent informed on a timely basis of all developments. Acquirer shall control
all Tax Proceedings in all respects and shall have the right to resolve
or settle such Tax Proceedings in its sole discretion, provided that if
Acquirer resolves or settles such Tax Proceedings without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Agent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed and which consent shall be deemed to have
been withheld if the Stockholders Agent does not object within thirty (30)
days after a written request for such consent by Acquirer that is delivered to
_both_ the Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta (subject to the right of
Acquirer to delivery of a second request in the manner provided in _Section
8.8_ and a deemed consent of the Stockholders Agent to such settlement if not
objected to by the Stockholders Agent within ten (10) days following receipt
of such second request by _both_ the Stockholders Agent and Paul Sparta),
such settlement or resolution by Acquirer of any such Tax Proceeding shall not
be determinative of the existence of or amount of Indemnifiable Damages
relating to such matter. In the event that the Stockholders Agent has
consented to any such settlement or resolution, neither the Stockholders
Agent 

 



92 ##### Table of Contents

  

 nor any Effective Time Holder shall have any power or authority to object
under _Section 8.5_ or any other provision of _Article 8_ to the amount of
any claim by or on behalf of any Acquirer Indemnified Person against the
Escrow Fund for indemnity with respect to such settlement or resolution.

(c) Acquirer, the Company, its Subsidiaries, the Final Surviving Entity and
the Stockholders Agent shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and
any Tax Proceeding; provided that the Stockholders Representative shall not
be required to prepare or file any Tax Returns or represent any Person in any
Tax Proceeding. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the
other partys request) the provision of records and information that are
reasonably relevant to any Tax Proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. 

(d) Acquirer shall prepare and file, at its own expense, all Tax Returns of
the Company and Holdco that are due after the Effective Time and that have
not been filed prior to the Effective Time. All Tax Returns of the Company or
Holdco that cover a Pre-Closing Period will be prepared in a manner consistent
with prior Tax Returns, unless required otherwise by applicable Law. Acquirer
shall provide any such Income, Sales or Use Tax Return to the Stockholders
Agent for its review, comment and consent to filing, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, no less than twenty (20)
days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return (including extensions).
If there is a dispute between the Stockholders Agent and Acquirer regarding
the treatment of any item with respect to such Tax Return, such dispute shall
be referred to an independent accounting firm for resolution, and the
decision of the independent accounting firm shall be final and binding, and
its fees and costs shall be paid one-half by the Effective Time Holders and
one-half by Acquirer.

 

(e) Acquirer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed, a claim for a refund (including IRS Form 1139) or amended Tax Returns
to effect a carryback of any item of loss, deduction or credit on any Income
Tax Returns for the Stub Period to Pre-Closing Periods to the fullest extent
permitted by Law. Acquirer shall pay to the Effective Time Holders an amount,
in cash, equal to any refund of Income Taxes received or credited. This
paragraph shall not apply to the extent that the refund was included in the
calculation of the Company Net Working Capital.

 

9.2. _Further Assurances_. The Company and Holdco shall cause each Company
Stockholder to further agree, upon request, to use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental
Entity or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).
