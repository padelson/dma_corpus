Merger and the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ shall be

record date for the regular quarterly cash distribution on the WPZ Common
Units that is paid or payable during the calendar quarter ending September
30, 2018 (the " _WPZ Third Quarter Distribution_ "). The " _Closing Date_ ,"
as referred to herein, shall mean the date on which the Closing actually
occurs.

 



13 (b) _Effective Time._ Concurrently with or as soon as practicable following
the Closing, Parent and WPZ shall cause a certificate of merger effecting the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware, duly executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA, as applicable (the date and time of such
filing (or, if agreed by the parties hereto, such later time and date as may
be expressed therein as the effective date and time of the Merger) being the "
_Effective Time_ "). Parent shall cause the Charter Amendment, duly executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of DGCL, to be filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger, and the Charter Amendment shall become effective at or
prior to the Effective Time. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall merge with and into
WPZ, the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and WPZ shall continue
as the surviving limited partnership in the Merger (the " _Surviving Entity_
").

(c) _Effect of the Merger on Equity Securities._ Subject in each case to
_Sections_ __ _ 2.1(e)_ and _2.1(f)_ , at the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, WPZ, WPZ
General Partner, any Holder of WPZ Units, any Holder of Parent Common Stock,
or any other Person:

(i) _Conversion of WPZ Public Units._  Each of the WPZ Public Units
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
the right to receive 1.494 shares of validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Stock; _provided_ that if the Effective Time
occurs on or after the record date for the regular quarterly cash dividend on
the Parent Common Stock that is paid or payable during the calendar quarter
ending September 30, 2018 (the " _Parent Third Quarter Dividend_ "), then
each of the WPZ Public Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall instead be converted into the right to receive 1.513 shares of
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent Common Stock (in either
case, such number of shares of Parent Common Stock, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

(ii) Each WPZ Public Unit, upon being converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)_, shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and
each Holder of such WPZ Public Units immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall thereafter cease to be a limited partner of WPZ or have any rights with
respect to such WPZ Public Units, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends, distributions and Fractional Share Payments
to which former Holders of WPZ Public Units become entitled all in accordance
with this _Article II_ upon the Surrender of (A) a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented WPZ Public Units (a "
_WPZ Certificate_ ") or (B) uncertificated WPZ Public Units represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry WPZ Common Units_ "), together with such properly
completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other documents in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(iii) _Treatment of WPZ-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Partnership Interests._
Any WPZ Units that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by WPZ
shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such canceled WPZ Units. All
(A) WPZ General Partner Interest, (B) WPZ Class B Units, (C) WPZ Incentive
Distribution Rights, and (D) WPZ Units that are not WPZ Public Units and are
not cancelled pursuant to the first sentence of this clause (iii) shall, in
each case, remain outstanding as partnership interests in the Surviving
Entity, unaffected by the Merger.

 



14 (iv) _Equity of Merger Sub_. The outstanding limited liability
company interest in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into an aggregate number of common units
of the Surviving Entity equal to the number of WPZ Public Units that are
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(i)_. At the Effective Time, the books and records of
WPZ shall be revised to reflect the cancellation and retirement of all WPZ
Public Units and the conversion of the limited liability company interest in
Merger Sub to common units of the Surviving Entity, and the existence of WPZ
(as the Surviving Entity) shall continue without dissolution.

 

(d) _Governing Documents of Parent_. Subject to receipt of the Parent Charter
Approval, the certificate of incorporation of Parent shall be amended at or
prior to the Effective Time as set forth in _Exhibit_ __ _ A_ (the " _Charter
Amendment_ "), and such certificate of incorporation, as amended by the
Charter Amendment, shall be the certificate of incorporation of Parent until
thereafter amended or changed as provided herein or by applicable Law.

(e) _Other Effects of the Merger._ The Merger shall be conducted in
accordance with and shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of DRULPA and DLLCA. At the Effective Time, (i) the
certificate of limited partnership of WPZ shall continue as the certificate
of limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, and (ii) the WPZ Partnership
Agreement shall remain unchanged and shall continue as the agreement of
limited partnership of the Surviving Entity, until duly amended in accordance
with applicable Law and the terms of the WPZ Partnership Agreement.

(f) _No Fractional Shares._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) no certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger and (ii) each registered
Holder of WPZ Public Units exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common
Stock (after taking into account all WPZ Public Units held by such Holder
immediately prior to the Effective Time) shall receive from Parent, in lieu of
such fractional share, an amount (a " _Fractional Share Payment_ ") in cash
(payable in dollars, without interest) equal to the product of (A) such
fraction, multiplied by (B) the average of the closing price of Parent Common
Stock as reported on the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape (as reported by
Bloomberg Financial Markets or such other source as the parties shall agree in
writing) over the five trading day period ending on the third trading day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. The parties acknowledge that
payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock was not separately bargained-for consideration but merely
represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



15 (g) _Certain Adjustments._ If between the Execution Date and the Effective
Time, whether or not permitted pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, the
number of outstanding WPZ Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be changed into a different number of units, shares or other securities
(including any different class or series of securities) by reason of any
dividend or distribution payable in partnership interests, voting securities,
equity interests or Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up,
combination, merger, consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar
transaction, or any such transaction shall be authorized, declared or agreed
upon with a record date at or prior to the Effective Time, then the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be appropriately
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of such transaction and to provide to
WPZ, Merger Sub and the Holders of WPZ Phantom Unit Awards and WPZ Public
Units the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to
such event, and thereafter, all references in this Agreement to the Merger
Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items shall be references to
the Merger Consideration, and any other similarly dependent items, as
so adjusted; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
2.1(g)_ shall be deemed to permit or authorize any party hereto to effect any
such dividend or distribution payable in equity securities or
Rights, subdivision, reclassification, split, split-up, combination, merger,
consolidation, reorganization, exchange or other similar transaction, or the
authorization, declaration or agreement to do such transaction that it is not
otherwise authorized or permitted to be undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement, Parent shall appoint
Computershare Trust Company, N.A. to act as exchange agent (the " _Exchange
Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and any dividends or
distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_  _and any

Units, an amount of cash sufficient to effect the delivery of the estimated
aggregate Fractional Share Payment (the " _Exchange Fund_ "), (B) reserve with

applicable in excess of the Exchange Fund as and when necessary to pay any

Fractional Share Payment and other amounts required to be paid under this
Agreement. Parent shall pay all costs and fees of the Exchange Agent and all
expenses associated with the exchange process. Any shares of Parent Common
Stock, and any remaining amount of the Exchange Fund or other funds deposited
shall be returned to Parent after the earlier to occur of (x) payment in full
of all amounts due to the Holders of WPZ Public Units and (y) the expiration
of the period specified in _Section_ __ _ 2.2(e)_.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or
shall cause the Exchange Agent to, mail to each Holder, as of the Effective
Time, of WPZ Public Units whose WPZ Public Units were converted into the right
to receive the Merger Consideration a form of letter of transmittal (the "
_Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the WPZ Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the WPZ Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by

 



16   _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_) to the Exchange Agent or, in the case of Book-
Entry WPZ Common Units, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
Letter of Transmittal, and which shall be in such customary form and have
such other provisions as Parent and WPZ may reasonably agree prior to the
Effective Time) and instructions for effecting the Surrender of such WPZ
Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit as contemplated by _Section_ __ _
2.2(b)_) or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units in exchange for, as applicable, whole
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ and any
Fractional Share Payment. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_, upon Surrender
to the Exchange Agent of such WPZ Certificates (or lost certificate affidavit
as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_) or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units,
together with such properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent,
the Holder of a WPZ Certificate (or lost certificate affidavit as
contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_) or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) that number of
whole shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-
entry form unless a physical certificate is requested) to which such Holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(c)(i)_, (ii) the Fractional Share
Payment, if any, payable in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock otherwise issuable, and (iii) any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ to which such
Holder is entitled. The instructions for effecting the Surrender of WPZ
Certificates shall set forth procedures that must be taken by the Holder of
any WPZ Certificate that has been lost, destroyed or stolen; it shall be a
condition to the right of such Holder to receive the Merger Consideration,
the Fractional Share Payment, if any, and any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ that
the Exchange Agent shall have received, along with the Letter of Transmittal,
a duly executed lost certificate affidavit, including an agreement to
indemnify Parent, signed exactly as the name or names of the registered Holder
or Holders of WPZ Public Units appeared on the books of WPZ immediately prior
to the Effective Time, together with a customary bond and such other
documents, in each case, as Parent may reasonably require in connection
therewith. After the Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on
the records of WPZ or its transfer agent of WPZ Certificates or Book-Entry WPZ
Common Units ( _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not restrict
the transfer of any WPZ Partnership Interest other than the WPZ Public Units
after the Effective Time); and if such WPZ Certificates or Book-Entry WPZ
Common Units are presented to WPZ or its transfer agent for transfer, they
shall be canceled against delivery of the appropriate Merger Consideration,
any Fractional Share Payment and any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ as hereinabove
provided. Until Surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.2(b)_,
each WPZ Certificate or Book-Entry WPZ Common Unit shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
Surrender the appropriate Merger Consideration, together with any dividends
or distributions payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _
2.2(d) _and the Fractional Share Payment, if any. No interest will be paid or
will accrue on any Fractional Share Payment or any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_.

 

(c) _Dividends and Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged WPZ Public
Units._ No dividends or other distributions with respect to shares of Parent
Common Stock issued in the Merger with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the Holder of any WPZ Certificate or Book-Entry WPZ Common
Units not Surrendered with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable in respect thereof until the Surrender of such WPZ Certificate or

 



17  Book-Entry WPZ Common Units in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, Parent shall pay, or cause the
Exchange Agent to pay, to the Holder of each WPZ Certificate or Book-Entry
WPZ Common Units, without interest, (i) at the time of Surrender of such WPZ
Certificate or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units, the amount of dividends or other
distributions previously paid with respect to the whole shares of Parent
Common Stock issuable with respect to such WPZ Certificate or Book-Entry WPZ
Common Units that have a record date after the Effective Time and a payment
date on or prior to the time of Surrender and (ii) at the appropriate payment
date, the amount of dividends and distributions payable with respect to such
whole shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective
Time and prior to such Surrender and a payment date subsequent to
such Surrender.

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in WPZ Public Units._ All Merger
Consideration issued upon the Surrender for exchange of WPZ Certificates or
Book-Entry WPZ Common Units in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_
(including any Fractional Share Payment) shall be deemed to have been issued
(and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the WPZ Public
Units heretofore represented by such WPZ Certificates or Book-Entry WPZ Common
Units, subject, however, to Parents obligation, notwithstanding the
conversion of WPZ Public Units pursuant to this Agreement, with respect to WPZ
Public Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, to pay (or
cause WPZ to pay) to the Holder of WPZ Public Units as of the applicable
record date any dividends and distributions with a record date at or prior to
the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by WPZ or the WPZ
General Partner with respect to such WPZ Common Units in accordance with the
terms of the WPZ Partnership Agreement on or prior to the Effective Time and
that remain unpaid at the Effective Time.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the Holders of the WPZ Certificates or Book-Entry
WPZ Common Units for twelve months after the Closing Date shall be delivered
to Parent, upon demand, and any Holders of the WPZ Certificates or Book-Entry
WPZ Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this  _Section_ __ _
2.2_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and only as general creditors
thereof for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, any
Fractional Share Payment and any dividends and distributions with respect to
WPZ Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock to which such Holders may be
entitled.

(f) _No Liability._ To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of
Parent, Merger Sub, WPZ, WPZ General Partner or the Exchange Agent shall be
liable to any Person in respect of any Merger Consideration, distribution or
Fractional Share Payment properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any WPZ
Certificates or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units shall not have been Surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any Merger Consideration, any
Fractional Share Payment or any dividends and distributions with respect to
WPZ Common Units or shares of Parent Common Stock in respect of such WPZ
Certificate or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units would escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity, any such units, cash or distributions in
respect of such WPZ Certificates or Book-Entry WPZ Common Units shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 



18 (g) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, Merger Sub and the Exchange Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement, without duplication, such amounts, which may
include shares of Parent Common Stock, as Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange
Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or deposited with
the relevant Governmental Entity by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
was made by Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(h) _No Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be
available with respect to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

SECTION 2.3  _Treatment of WPZ Phantom Unit Awards._

(a) At the Effective Time, each WPZ Phantom Unit Award that is not vested and
does not vest in accordance with its terms (as set forth in an applicable
award agreement) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall cease to represent an award with respect to WPZ Common Units and
shall be converted into an award with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock
(a " _Parent Award_ "), subject to the same vesting and forfeiture provisions
as were applicable under such WPZ Phantom Unit Award immediately prior to the
Effective Time, with the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to
each such Parent Award to be equal to the number of WPZ Common Units subject
to each such WPZ Phantom Unit Award immediately prior to the Effective Time
multiplied by the Merger Consideration (such product, rounded to the nearest
whole share), with any corresponding accrued but unpaid DERs (as defined in
the WPZ Legacy Long-Term Incentive Plan) with respect to any WPZ Phantom
Unit Awards to be assumed, remain outstanding and continue to represent an
obligation with respect to the applicable Parent Award.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, WPZ and WPZ General Partner shall take all
action necessary to effectuate the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.
WPZ and WPZ General Partner shall ensure that, as of immediately following the
Effective Time, no holder of a WPZ Phantom Unit Award or participant in the
WPZ Legacy Long-Term Incentive Plan or WPZ GP Long-Term Incentive Plan shall
have any rights thereunder to acquire, or other rights in respect of, the
equity of WPZ, the Surviving Entity or any of the WPZ Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall reserve for issuance a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock at least equal to the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that will
be subject to the Parent Awards as a result of the actions contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 2.3_. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, Parent shall, to the extent legally required, file a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form, or if Form S-8 is not available,
other appropriate forms, including Form S-3) with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to such Parent Awards and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of any such registration statement
or registration statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus
or prospectuses contained therein) for so long as such Parent Awards remain
outstanding and the offering with respect thereto is required to be
registered.

such Governing Documents are in full force and effect and no WPZ Party is in
violation of any provisions thereof.

958,183,223 WPZ Common Units, 18,442,649 WPZ Class B Units, the WPZ General

_Section_ __ _ 3.4(a)_, as of the Execution Date there are not any WPZ Units,
partnership interests, voting securities or equity interests of WPZ issued and
outstanding or any Rights issued or granted by, or binding upon, WPZ, except
as set forth in the WPZ SEC Reports (without giving effect to any WPZ SEC
Report or any amendment to any WPZ SEC Report in each case filed on or after
the Execution Date) or the WPZ Partnership Agreement as in effect on 

 



22  the Execution Date, except for awards granted under the WPZ Legacy Long-Term
Incentive Plan or the WPZ GP Long-Term Incentive Plan, or except as expressly
contemplated by this Agreement. Except as set forth in the WPZ Partnership
Agreement as in effect on the Execution Date, there are no outstanding
obligations of WPZ or any WPZ Group Entity to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any WPZ Units or other partnership interests, voting securities or
equity interests or any Rights of WPZ or any WPZ Group Entity. There are no
outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the holders of
which have the right to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into
or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the limited
partners of WPZ on any matter.

 

(b) Section 3.4(b) of the WPZ Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of the WPZ Subsidiaries as of the Execution Date. As of the
Execution Date, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity
or voting interests of each WPZ Subsidiary owned directly or indirectly by the
WPZ Parties (i) are owned, beneficially and of record free and clear of all
Liens in the percentages set out on Section 3.4(b) of the WPZ Disclosure
Letter and (ii) have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid
(with respect to WPZ Subsidiaries that are limited liability companies or
limited partnerships, to the extent required under the limited liability
company agreement or limited partnership agreement of the applicable WPZ
Subsidiary) and nonassessable (with respect to WPZ Subsidiaries that are
limited liability companies or limited partnerships, except as such
nonassessability may be affected by Sections 18-607 and 18-804 of the DLLCA or
by Sections 17-303, 17-607 and 17-804 of the DRULPA and the Governing
Documents of the applicable entity).

 

(c) Other than ownership interests in the WPZ Subsidiaries set forth on
Section 3.4(b) of the WPZ Disclosure Letter, WPZ does not own beneficially,
directly or indirectly, any equity securities or other ownership interests of
any Person as of the Execution Date. There are no outstanding Rights issued or
granted by, or binding upon, any of the WPZ Subsidiaries as of the Execution
Date.

(d) Except as set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 3.4_, neither WPZ nor any
WPZ Subsidiary has issued any compensatory equity or equity-linked award that
remains outstanding, nor has any such entity committed to issue any such
award.

 

SECTION 3.5 _SEC Documents; Internal Controls_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2016, all reports, including but not limited to the
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, the Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and the
Current Reports on Form 8-K (whether filed on a voluntary basis or otherwise),
forms, schedules, certifications, prospectuses, registration statements and
other documents required to be filed or furnished by WPZ or any WPZ Subsidiary
with or to the SEC have been or will be timely filed or furnished (the " _WPZ
SEC Reports_ "). Each of the WPZ SEC Reports (i) complied in all material
respects with the requirements of applicable Law (including the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ")),
and (ii) as of its effective date (in the case of WPZ SEC Reports that are
registration statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities
Act) and as of its filing date did not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light 

 



23  of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except for
any statements (x) in any WPZ SEC Report that may have been modified by an
amendment to such report or a subsequent report filed with the SEC prior to
the Execution Date or (y) with respect to information supplied in writing by
or on behalf of Parent, as to which WPZ makes no representation or warranty.

 

(b) Except as set forth on Section 3.5(b) of the WPZ Disclosure Letter, no
WPZ Subsidiary is required to file reports, forms or other documents with the
SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act. There are no outstanding comments from, or
unresolved issues raised by, the staff of the SEC with respect to the WPZ SEC
Reports. No enforcement action has been initiated against WPZ relating to
disclosures contained or omitted from any WPZ SEC Report.

(c) WPZ makes and keeps books, records, and accounts and has devised and
maintains a system of internal controls, in each case, as required pursuant to
Section 13(b)(2) under the Exchange Act. WPZ has established and maintains
disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial
reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively,
of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act and the applicable listing standards of the NYSE. Such disclosure
controls and procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material
information required to be disclosed by WPZ in the reports that it files
under the Exchange Act are recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to its management
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. WPZ
General Partners principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to
WPZs auditors and the audit committee of the WPZ Board (x) all significant
deficiencies in the designation or operation of internal controls which could
adversely affect WPZs ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and have identified for WPZs auditors any material weakness
in internal controls and (y) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in WPZs internal
controls.

 

(d) Since January 1, 2016, the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the WPZ General Partner have made all certifications
(without qualification or exceptions to the matters certified, except as to
Knowledge) required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the statements contained in
any such certifications are complete and correct, and none of such entities
or its officers have received notice from any Governmental Entity questioning
or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing or
submission of such certification. As of the Execution Date, and except
as disclosed in a WPZ SEC Report filed with the SEC prior to the Execution
Date, none of such entities has any Knowledge of any material weaknesses in
the design or operation of such internal controls over financial reporting.

 

SECTION 3.6 _Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) WPZs Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 3,
2018 (the " _WPZ 8-K_") sets forth a true and complete copy of the
consolidated audited statements of comprehensive income, changes in equity,
and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31,
2017 and balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 for

 



24  WPZ, including the notes thereto (the referenced financial statements set
forth in the WPZ 8-K are collectively referred to as the " _WPZ
Financial Statements_ "). The WPZ Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
covered thereby (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and present
fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of WPZ as
of such dates and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of WPZ
for such periods, except as otherwise noted therein. Except as set forth in
the WPZ Financial Statements, there are no off-balance sheet arrangements
that would, individually or in the aggregate, have a WPZ Material Adverse
Effect. WPZ has not had any disagreement with its independent public
accounting firm that required disclosure in the WPZ SEC Reports.

(b) There are no liabilities or obligations of WPZ, WPZ General Partner or
the WPZ Subsidiaries (whether known or unknown and whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) and there are no facts or circumstances that would
reasonably be expected to result in any such liabilities or obligations,
whether arising in the context of federal, state or local judicial,
regulatory, administrative or permitting agency Proceedings, other than (i)
liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved against in the WPZ Financial
Statements, (ii) current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business since December 31, 2017, (iii) liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iv) liabilities or
obligations (whether known or unknown and whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
have a WPZ Material Adverse Effect.

 

SECTION 3.7 _Real Property;  Rights-of-Way_.

(a) Each of the WPZ Group Entities has good, valid and marketable title to
all real property, good and valid leasehold interest in each material lease,
sublease and other agreement under which the WPZ Group Entities uses or
occupies or has the right to use or occupy any material real property and
good title to all tangible personal property owned by the WPZ Group Entities

and (ii) all information concerning the disclosing Party Groups business,
properties and personnel as the requesting Party Group may reasonably request,
including all information relating to environmental matters. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a Party Group shall have no obligation to disclose or provide
access to any information the disclosure of which such Party Group has
concluded may jeopardize any privilege available to such Party Group relating
to such information or would be in violation of a confidentiality obligation
binding on such Party Group. Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of April 12, 2018 between Parent and
WPZ (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), each party shall hold information received from the other party pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 5.2_ in confidence in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 5.3 _Certain Filings; Parent Stockholder Meeting_ _; Recommendation
of Merger; No Solicitation by Parent._

(a) As promptly as practicable following the Execution Date (i) Parent and
WPZ shall jointly prepare and file with the SEC, and each of the WPZ Parties
and the Parent Parties agrees to cooperate in the preparation of the
Registration Statement (including the joint
consent statement/prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement constituting a part
thereof (the " _Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement_ ")) and
Parent shall file with the SEC the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy
Statement, (ii) Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger to be approved
for listing on the NYSE (subject, if applicable, to notice of issuance) prior
to the Effective Time, and (iii) the parties hereto shall make all required
filings under applicable state securities and "blue sky" Laws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such filings shall be required in any jurisdiction where,
as a result thereof, Parent would become subject to general service of
process or to taxation or qualification to do business as a foreign
corporation doing business in such jurisdiction solely as a result of such
filing. Parent agrees to file the Registration Statement with the SEC as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Each of Parent and WPZ agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to be
declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after
filing thereof and keep the Registration Statement effective until the

 



45  earlier of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.
The Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement, as it may be amended
or supplemented from time to time prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting,
shall specify the date on which the record date for the Parent Third Quarter
Dividend shall occur. Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
stockholders of Parent as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act. Each of Parent and
WPZ agrees to furnish to the other party all information concerning the
Parent Group Entities or the WPZ Group Entities, as applicable, and to take
such other action as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
foregoing. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement or the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement will be
made by Parent or WPZ, in each case without providing the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. 

(b) Each of the Parent Parties and the WPZ Parties agrees, as to itself and
its Subsidiaries, that (i) none of the information supplied or to be supplied
by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Registration
Statement will, at the time the Registration Statement and each amendment or
supplement thereto, if any, becomes effective under the Securities
Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and (ii) none of the information supplied
or to be supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto will, at the date the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent
Proxy Statement is mailed to the Holders of WPZ Common Units or Parent Common
Stock, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
Parent Parties and the WPZ Parties further agrees that, if it shall become
aware prior to the Closing Date of any information that would cause any of the
statements in the Registration Statement or the Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement to be false or misleading with
respect to any material fact, or omit to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not false or misleading, it will promptly inform the other party
thereof and take the necessary steps to correct such information in an
amendment or supplement to the Registration Statement or Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement.

 

(c) Each of WPZ and Parent shall (1) promptly notify the other of receipt of
any comments from the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government
official and of any requests by the SEC or its staff or any other applicable
government official for amendments or supplements to any of the filings with
the SEC in connection with the Merger and other transactions
contemplated hereby or for additional information and (2) promptly supply the
other with copies of all correspondence between WPZ or any of its
representatives, or Parent or any of its representatives, as the case may be,
on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff or any other applicable government
official, on the other hand, with respect thereto. Parent and WPZ shall use
their respective commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent
Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement as promptly as practicable.

 



46 (d) WPZ General Partner shall distribute to the Holders of WPZ Units the
Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement, which shall include a
form of consent that may be executed by Holders of WPZ Units in connection
with the Written Consent as promptly as practicable after the Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act.

(e) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following the effective date of the
Registration Statement, establish a record date for, duly call, give notice
of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent
Stockholder Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder
Approval. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(h)_, Parent shall, through the
Parent Board, recommend to its stockholders approval of the Parent Stock
Issuance and adoption of the Charter Amendment (the " _Parent
Board Recommendation_ "). Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(h)_, Parent shall
use reasonable best efforts to obtain from its stockholders the Parent
Stockholder Approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the obligations of Parent set forth in the first sentence of this _Section_
__ _ 5.3(e)_ shall not be affected by a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
or by any action by the Parent Board with respect to this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, Parent may postpone or adjourn the Parent
Stockholder Meeting (i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, (ii) in the absence of quorum,
(iii) if Parent has delivered any notice contemplated by _Section_ __ _
5.3(h)_ and the time periods contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 5.3(h)_ have not
expired, or (iv) to allow reasonable additional time for the filing and/or
mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure that Parent has determined
after consultation with outside legal counsel is necessary under applicable
Law and for such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and
reviewed by the stockholders of Parent prior to the Parent Stockholder
Meeting; provided, however, that in each case, without the prior written
consent of the WPZ Conflicts Committee, Parent shall not be permitted to
postpone or adjourn the Parent Stockholder Meeting for more than ten (10)
Business Days later than the most recently adjourned meeting or to a date
after the date that is two (2) Business Days prior to the Termination Date.
Without the written consent of the Conflicts Committee (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), no matter shall be submitted
for action at the Parent Stockholder Meeting except the approval of the
Parent Stock Issuance and adoption of the Charter Amendment and matters
reasonably related to the Parent Stock Issuance and adoption of the Charter
Amendment.

 

(f) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable best
efforts to, cause its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal, and immediately prohibit any access by any Person (other than
the WPZ Parties and their Representatives) to any confidential information
relating to a possible Parent Acquisition Proposal. Except as permitted by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time, Parent shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and use reasonable
best efforts to cause its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage the submission of a Parent Acquisition Proposal
(including any acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share
exchange), (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or
furnish any non-public information with respect to, any proposal or offer from
any Person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Parent

 



47  Acquisition Proposal, (iii) knowingly assist, participate in or facilitate
in any other manner any effort or attempt by any Person to do or seek any of
the foregoing, (iv) enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (v)
(A) withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withdraw, modify or
qualify, in a manner adverse to WPZ, such Parent Board Recommendation, (B)
fail to include such Parent Board Recommendation in the Parent Proxy
Statement, (C) authorize, approve, declare advisable, adopt or recommend or
propose to publicly authorize, approve, declare advisable, adopt or recommend,
any Parent Acquisition Proposal, or (D) authorize Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement or enter into
an agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to any Parent
Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
(any such action in clause (v) being referred to herein as a " _Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Parent shall notify the WPZ Conflicts
Committee promptly orally and in writing, and in no event later than 48 hours
after receipt, if any Person makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact
with respect to, or requests any information with respect to, or seeks any
discussions or negotiations to be initiated or continued with respect to, a
Parent Acquisition Proposal, and Parent shall, in any such notice to the WPZ
Conflicts Committee, indicate the identity of such Person and the material
terms and conditions of any such proposal or offer and the nature and content
of such inquiry or contact, and thereafter shall promptly keep the WPZ
Conflicts Committee reasonably informed of all material developments affecting
the status and terms of any such proposal, offer, inquiry or request and of
the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.3_, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, (i) Parent has received a written
Parent Acquisition Proposal that the Parent Board believes is bona fide, (ii)
the Parent Board, after consultation with Parents financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that such Parent Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a
Parent Designated Proposal and, after consultation with Parents outside
legal counsel, failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its duties to stockholders under applicable Laws and (iii)
such Parent Acquisition Proposal did not result from a material breach of
this  _Section_ __ _ 5.3_, then Parent may, subject to clauses (x) and (y)
below, (A) furnish information, including confidential information, with
respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Parent Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal; provided, however,
that (x) Parent and its respective Subsidiaries will not, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause their respective Representatives not to,
disclose any non-public information to such Person unless Parent has, or first
enters into, an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (y)
Parent will provide to WPZ and the WPZ General Partner non-public information
with respect to Parent and its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided
or made available to WPZ and the WPZ General Partner prior to or
substantially concurrently with providing or making available such non-public
information to such other Person.

 

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time
prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, and subject to compliance
with the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.3(h)_, the Parent Board may, if
the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Parents financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law, make a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to either (x) an unsolicited Parent
Designated Proposal or (y) an Intervening Event; _provided further_ ,
_however_ , that

 



48 (i) the Parent Board may not effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to a Parent Designated Proposal unless:

(A) Parent has provided prior written notice to WPZ (in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_) specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such
action (including the identity of the Person making such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, a description of the material terms and conditions of such
Parent Designated Proposal and complete copies of any written proposal or
offers (including proposed agreements) received by Parent in connection with
such Parent Acquisition Proposal) at least three (3) days in advance of its
intention to take such action with respect to a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, unless at the time such notice is required to be given there are less
than three (3) days prior to the Parent Stockholder Meeting, in which case the
Parent shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period
inclusive of all such days, the " _Parent Notice Period_ ");

 

(B) during the Parent Notice Period the Parent Board (A) has negotiated, and
has used reasonable best efforts to cause its financial advisor and outside
legal counsel to negotiate, with WPZ in good faith to make such adjustments in
the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the failure to effect such
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would not be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law
and (B) keeps WPZ and the WPZ Conflicts Committee reasonably informed with
respect to the status and changes in the material terms and conditions of
such Parent Acquisition Proposal or other changes in circumstances related
thereto; provided, further, that any material amendment to the terms of a
Parent Designated Proposal, if applicable, shall require a new notice pursuant
to this Section 5.3(h) and a new Parent Notice Period, except that such new
Parent Notice Period in connection with any material amendment shall be for
one Business Day from the time WPZ receives such notice (as opposed to three
days); and

 

(C) the Parent Board shall take into account all changes to the terms of this
Agreement proposed by WPZ or the WPZ Conflicts Committee in determining (A)
whether such Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Parent Designated
Proposal even if such changes were given effect and (B) whether the failure to
effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law
even if such changes were given effect; and

 

(ii) the Parent Board may not effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in
response to an Intervening Event unless:

 



49 (A) Parent provides WPZ (in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 8.1_) with
written information describing such Intervening Event in reasonable detail as
soon as reasonably practicable after becoming aware of it;

 

(B) Parent keeps WPZ and the WPZ Conflicts Committee reasonably informed of
developments with respect to such Intervening Event;

(C) Parent notifies WPZ (in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.1_) in writing
at least three Business Days before making an Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change with respect to such Intervening Event of its intention to do so and
specifies the reasons therefor; and

 

(D) if WPZ or the WPZ Conflicts Committee makes a proposal during such three
Business Day period to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Parent Board, after taking into consideration the adjusted terms and
conditions of this Agreement as proposed by WPZ or the WPZ Conflicts
Committee, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation
with outside counsel) that the failure to make such Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to stockholders under applicable Law even if such changes
were given effect.

 

(i) Unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with _Article_
__ _ VII_, Parent shall submit the Parent Stock Issuance and adoption of the
Charter Amendment for approval at the Parent Stockholder Meeting even if the
Parent Board shall have effected a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

(j) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent Parent or the Parent
Board, as applicable, from issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying with Rule 14d-9
and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a Parent Acquisition
Proposal if the Parent Board determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel) that its failure to do so would be reasonably likely to
constitute a violation of applicable Laws; provided, however, that any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change may only be made in accordance with Section
5.3(h).

SECTION 5.4 _Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_ _._ From
and after the Execution Date, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement as promptly as practicable and (ii) defend any lawsuits or
other Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or seek to have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining
order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the parties to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger. Without
limiting the foregoing but subject to the other terms of this Agreement, the
parties hereto agree that, from time to time, whether before, at or after the
Closing Date, each of them will execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, such instruments of assignment, transfer, conveyance,
endorsement, direction or

 



50  authorization as may be necessary to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Agreement will require any party hereto to hold separate or
make any divestiture not expressly contemplated herein of any asset or
otherwise agree to any restriction on its operations or other condition in
order to obtain any consent or approval or other clearance required by
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.5 _No Public Announcement_ _._ On the Execution Date, Parent and WPZ
shall issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this
Agreement and the Merger, which press release shall be reasonably satisfactory
to Parent and WPZ General Partner. From and after the Execution Date, neither
WPZ nor Parent shall issue any other press release or make any other public
announcement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with
this Agreement) (other than public announcements at industry road shows
and conferences or as may be required by applicable Law or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with the NYSE, in which event the party
making the public announcement or press release shall, to the extent
practicable, notify Parent and WPZ General Partner in advance of such public
announcement or press release) without the prior approval of Parent and WPZ
General Partner, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned.

 

SECTION 5.6 _Expenses_ _._ Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _
7.5_ and  _Section_ __ _ 7.6_, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, including legal
fees, accounting fees, financial advisory fees and other professional and non-
professional fees and expenses, shall be paid by the party hereto incurring
such expenses, except that Parent and WPZ shall each pay for one-half of (a)
any filing fees with respect to the Registration Statement and the Consent
Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement and (b) the costs of printing and
mailing of the Consent Statement/Prospectus/Parent Proxy Statement.

 

SECTION 5.7 _Regulatory Issues_ _._ WPZ and Parent shall cooperate fully with
respect to any filing, submission or communication with a Governmental Entity
having jurisdiction over the Merger. Such cooperation shall include each of
the parties hereto: (i) providing, in the case of oral communications with a
Governmental Entity, advance notice of any such communication and, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, an opportunity for the other party to
participate; (ii) providing, in the case of written communications, an
opportunity for the other party to comment on any such communication and
provide the other with a final copy of all such communications; and (iii)
complying promptly with any request for information from a Governmental Entity
(including an additional request for information and documentary material),
unless directed not to do so by the other party hereto. All cooperation shall
be conducted in such a manner so as to preserve all applicable privileges.

SECTION 5.8 _Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes (and for
purposes of any applicable state, local or foreign Tax that follows the U.S.
federal income tax treatment), the parties agree to treat the Merger (a) with
respect to holders of WPZ Public Units, as a taxable sale of such WPZ Common
Units to Parent and (b) with respect to Parent, as a purchase by Parent of the
assets of WPZ attributable to such WPZ Common Units. The parties will prepare
and file all Tax Returns consistent with the foregoing and will not take any
inconsistent position on any Tax Return, or during the course of any audit,
litigation or other proceeding with respect

 

to Taxes, except as otherwise required by applicable Law following a final
determination by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
administrative settlement with or final administrative decision by the
relevant Governmental Entity.

 



51 SECTION 5.9 _D andO Insurance_.

 

(a) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Laws, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall, and
shall cause the WPZ Group Entities to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless against
any reasonable costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and all
other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees,
travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier
charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being
a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Proceeding arising
from acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), including any Proceeding
relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by a WPZ DandO
Indemnified Party), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities,
penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments
and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any
thereof) in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding arising from
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and, upon receipt by Parent of
an undertaking by or on behalf of the WPZ DandO Indemnified Party to repay such
amount if it shall be determined in a final and non-appealable judgment
entered by a court of competent jurisdiction that the WPZ DandO Indemnified
Party is not entitled to be indemnified, provide advancement of expenses with
respect to each of the foregoing to, all WPZ DandO Indemnified Parties and (ii)
honor all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses, elimination of
liability and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at
or prior to the Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) now existing in favor of the WPZ DandO Indemnified Parties as
provided in the Governing Documents of any WPZ Group Entity, under applicable
Delaware Law or otherwise, and shall ensure that the Governing Documents of
WPZ and WPZ General Partner (or their successor entities) shall, for a period
of six years following the Effective Time, contain provisions substantially no
less advantageous with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
elimination of liability and exculpation of their present and former
directors, officers, employees and agents than are set forth in the Governing
Documents of WPZ and WPZ General Partner as of the Execution Date. Any
right of a WPZ DandO Indemnified Party pursuant to this Section 5.9(a) shall
not be amended, repealed, terminated or otherwise modified at any time in a
manner that would adversely affect the rights of such WPZ DandO Indemnified
Party as provided herein, and shall be enforceable by such WPZ DandO
Indemnified Party and their respective heirs and representatives against
Parent and its respective successors and assigns.

 

(b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
officers and directors liability insurance with a nationally reputable
carrier covering each WPZ DandO Indemnified Party who is or at any time prior to
the Effective Time was covered by the existing officers and directors
liability insurance applicable to the WPZ Group Entities (" _D andO
Insurance_"), on terms substantially no less advantageous to the WPZ DandO
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, than such existing insurance with respect
to acts or omissions, or alleged acts or 

 



52  omissions, at or prior to the Effective Time (whether claims, actions or
other Proceedings relating thereto are commenced, asserted or claimed before
or after the Effective Time);  _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not
be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance for the WPZ DandO
Indemnified Parties in excess of 300% of the current annual premium currently
paid by the WPZ Group Entities for such insurance, but shall purchase as much
of such coverage as possible for such applicable amount. Parent shall have the
right to cause such coverage to be extended under the applicable DandO Insurance
by obtaining a six-year "tail" policy on terms and conditions no less
advantageous to the WPZ DandO Indemnified Parties than the existing DandO
Insurance, and such "tail" policy shall satisfy the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

(c) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall survive
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement for a period of six years and expressly are intended to benefit
each of the WPZ DandO Indemnified Parties; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the
event that any claim or claims for indemnification or advancement set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ are asserted or made within such six-year period,
all rights to indemnification and advancement in respect of any such claim or
claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims. The rights of any
WPZ DandO Indemnified Party under this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ shall be in addition
to any other rights such WPZ DandO Indemnified Party may have under the
Governing Documents of any WPZ Group Entity or applicable Law.

(d) In the event Parent or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in
either such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that its
successors and assigns, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

SECTION 5.10 _Consent to Use of Financial Statements; Financing Cooperation_
_._ The WPZ Parties hereby consent to the Parent Group Entities use of and
reliance on any audited or unaudited financial statements, including the WPZ
Financial Statements, relating to the WPZ Group Entities reasonably requested
by the Parent Parties to be used in any financing or other activities of the
Parent Parties permitted hereby, including any filings that the Parent Parties
desire to make with the SEC. In addition, the WPZ Parties will use
commercially reasonable efforts, at the Parent Parties sole cost and
expense, to obtain the consents of Ernst and Young LLP (with respect to certain
consolidated financial statements of WPZ) and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP and
Deloitte and Touche LLP (both with respect to the financial statements of
Gulfstream Natural Gas System, L.L.C.) to the inclusion of the financial
statements referenced above in appropriate filings with the SEC. Prior to the
Closing, the WPZ Parties will provide the Parent Parties such information, and
make available such personnel, as the Parent Parties may reasonably request
in order to assist any of the Parent Group Entities in connection with
financing activities permitted hereby, including any public offerings to be
registered under the Securities Act or private offerings. 

 



53 SECTION 5.11 _Dividends and Distributions_.

 

(a) After the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_, the WPZ General Partner shall (and Parent shall
directly or indirectly cause its representatives on the WPZ Board to)
determine, declare and cause WPZ to pay regular quarterly cash distributions
on the WPZ Common Units for each quarter in accordance with the
WPZ Partnership Agreement in the ordinary course and consistent with past
practice, including with respect to amount and timing of record dates and
payment dates; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to applicable Law and 
_Section_ __ _ 5.11(b)_, any such regular quarterly distribution shall not be
less than $0.614 per Common Unit without the separate determination and
approval of the WPZ Conflicts Committee made in accordance with the
WPZ Partnership Agreement and their duties as directors of the WPZ Board. The
WPZ General Partner shall (and Parent shall directly or indirectly cause its
representatives on the WPZ Board to) designate the record date for the WPZ
Third Quarter Distribution so that such record date precedes the Effective
Time so as to permit the payment of the WPZ Third Quarter Distribution to the
Holders of WPZ Public Units.

 

(b) If Closing occurs on or after the record date for the Parent Third Quarter
Dividend, each of Parent and WPZ shall coordinate with the other regarding
the declaration of any dividends or distributions in respect of Parent Common
Stock and WPZ Common Units and the record dates and payment dates relating
thereto, it being the intention of the parties that if Closing occurs on or
after the record date for the Parent Third Quarter Dividend, Holders of WPZ
Common Units shall not receive distributions both in respect of WPZ Common
Units and also dividends in respect of the Parent Common Stock that they
receive in exchange therefor in the Merger, but that they shall receive for
any such quarter (exclusive of any dividends received in respect of Parent
Common Stock not received by such Holders in the Merger) either: (a) only
distributions in respect of WPZ Common Units or (b) only dividends in respect
of Parent Common Stock that they receive in exchange therefor in the Merger.

SECTION 5.12 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the WPZ Board
and the Parent Board shall take all such steps as may be necessary or
appropriate to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispositions of WPZ Units (including derivative securities with
respect to such WPZ Units) or acquisitions of shares of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to such shares Parent Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to WPZ, or will become subject to such reporting
requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.

SECTION 5.13 _Conflicts Committee_ _._ Prior to the Effective Time, none of
the WPZ Group Entities shall, without the consent of the WPZ Conflicts
Committee, eliminate the WPZ Conflicts Committee, or revoke or diminish the
authority of the WPZ Conflicts Committee, or remove or cause the removal
of any director of the WPZ Board that is a member of the WPZ Conflicts
Committee either as a member of such board or such committee without the
affirmative vote of the members of the WPZ Board, including the affirmative
vote of each of the other members of the WPZ Conflicts Committee. For the
avoidance of doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 5.13_ shall not apply to the filling
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Governing Documents of any
vacancies caused by the death, incapacity or resignation of any director.

 



54 SECTION 5.14 _Takeover Statutes_ _._ Parent shall not, and shall cause its

failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date;

(b) a Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or

of such intentional or willful and material breach, at law or in equity, shall
be preserved.

 



58 SECTION 7.6 _Parent Termination Fee_.

 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated (i) by WPZ pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 7.3(a)_ (Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) or (ii) by WPZ or Parent
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(c)_ (Parent Stockholder Approval), and in the
case of each of clause (i) and (ii) where prior to such termination a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred, then Parent shall pay to WPZ,
after the date of termination, the Parent Termination Fee, which payment,
subject to _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_, shall be paid in four equal quarterly
installments, with each such installment to be paid within two (2) Business
Days following the first four dates that a regular quarterly distribution is
paid to holders of WPZ Units following termination of this Agreement.

 

(b) In the event that (i) a Parent Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
proposed or publicly disclosed by any Person or such a Parent Acquisition
Proposal has otherwise become publicly known to Parents stockholders
generally and in any event such proposal is not subsequently irrevocably
withdrawn at least seven days prior to the earlier of the Parent Stockholder
Meeting or the termination of this Agreement, (ii) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent or WPZ pursuant to Section 7.2(a) (Termination
Date) or Section 7.2(c) (Parent Stockholder Approval) and (iii) within 12
months after the termination of this Agreement, Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries enters into any definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, such Parent Acquisition Proposal, then, subject to _Section_ __ _
7.6(d)_, Parent shall pay to WPZ, upon the first to occur of such entering
into a definitive agreement or consummation of such Parent Acquisition
Proposal, the Parent Termination Fee; provided that for purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6(b)_, "25%" shall be deemed to be references to "50%" in
the definition of Parent Acquisition Proposal.

(c) If this Agreement is validly terminated by WPZ pursuant to the provisions
of _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_ (Parent Uncured Breach), then Parent shall pay to
WPZ by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by WPZ an amount equal to the WPZ Expenses, and such payment shall be made
within five (5) Business Days after such termination.

(d) The " _Parent Termination Fee_ " shall be an amount of cash equal to the
lesser of (i) $410 million (the " _Parent Base Amount_ ") and (ii) the maximum
aggregate amount, if any, that can be paid to WPZ without causing WPZ to fail
the gross income requirement in Section 7704(c)(2) of the Code for any WPZ
taxable year within the Measurement Period (as defined below), treating the
Parent Termination Fee and the WPZ Expenses as non-qualifying income and
after taking into consideration all other sources of non-qualifying income
(such maximum amount, the " _Non-Qualifying Income Cushion_"), for the
applicable year, as determined by WPZs independent accountants.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event WPZ receives an opinion from
outside counsel or a ruling from the IRS (" _Tax Guidance_ ") providing that
WPZs receipt of the Parent Base Amount would either constitute qualifying
income (as defined in Section 7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from
gross income for purposes of Section 7704 of the Code, the Parent Termination
Fee shall be an amount equal to the Parent Base Amount and Parent shall, upon
receiving notice that WPZ has received the Tax Guidance, pay to WPZ any unpaid
portion of the Parent Base Amount within five (5) Business Days. In the event
that WPZ is not able to initially receive a Parent Termination Fee equal to
the full Parent Base Amount due to the above limitations, Parent shall place
an amount in cash equal to the unpaid portion of the Parent Base Amount in
escrow by wire transfer within three (3)

 



59  Business Days of such determination and shall not release any portion
thereof to WPZ unless and until WPZ receives either: (x) a letter from an
independent nationally recognized accounting firm indicating the amount of
the Non-Qualifying Income Cushion determined for any subsequent WPZ taxable
year (in which case Parent shall pay to WPZ the lesser of the unpaid portion
of the Parent Base Amount or the amount of the Non-Qualifying Income Cushion
determined for such subsequent WPZ taxable year within five (5) Business Days
after Parent has been notified thereof) or (y) Tax Guidance providing that
WPZs receipt of such portion would either constitute qualifying income (as
defined in Section 7704(d) of the Code) or be excluded from gross income for
purposes of Section 7704 of the Code (in which case Parent shall pay to
WPZ any unpaid portion of the Parent Base Amount within five (5) Business
Days after Parent has been notified thereof). Parent agrees to cooperate with
WPZ to maximize the portion of the Parent Base Amount that may be paid as the
Parent Termination Fee without causing WPZ to fail to meet the requirements
of Section 7704(c)(2) of the Code, including using its commercially reasonable
efforts to assist WPZ in obtaining a favorable ruling or legal opinion from
outside counsel, in each case, as described in this _Section_ __ _ 7.6(d)_.
The obligation of Parent to pay any unpaid portion of the Parent Base Amount
shall terminate at the close of the period ending December 31 following the
date that is five (5) years from the date of this Agreement (the "
_Measurement Period_ "). Any amounts remaining in escrow after the obligation
of Parent to pay the Parent Base Amount terminates shall be retained by
Parent.

 

(e) The parties acknowledge that the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, none of the parties would enter into this
Agreement. The parties agree that upon termination of this Agreement under
circumstances in which the Parent Termination Fee is payable, receipt of the
Parent Termination Fee shall be WPZs sole and exclusive remedy under this
Agreement, and upon such termination, Parent shall have no further liability
to WPZ or the WPZ General Partner of any kind in respect of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement other than its
obligation to pay the Parent Termination Fee and WPZ Expenses and except as
expressly set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.5_. In no event shall Parent be
required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one occasion
(provided that for the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Termination Fee shall be
paid in multiple installments in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.6(a)_). In
the event that Parent pays the WPZ Expenses pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
7.6_, then any Parent Termination Fee required to be paid by Parent under this
_Section_ __ _ 7.6_ shall be reduced by the amount of the WPZ
Expenses previously paid.

SECTION 7.7 _Survival_ _._ None of the representations, warranties,
agreements, covenants or obligations in this Agreement or in any instrument
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the consummation of the
Merger, except for those covenants and agreements contained herein that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part after the
Effective Time.

SECTION 7.8 _Enforcement of this Agreement_ _._ The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that an award of money damages would be inadequate for any breach
of this Agreement by any party and any such breach would cause the non-
breaching parties irreparable harm. Accordingly, the parties hereto agree that
prior to the termination of this Agreement, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement by one of the parties, the parties will
also be entitled, without the requirement of posting a bond or other security,
to equitable relief,

 



60  including injunctive relief and specific performance, _provided_ such party
is not in material default hereunder. Such remedies will not be the exclusive
remedies for any breach of this Agreement but will be in addition to all
other remedies available at law or equity to each of the parties.

SECTION 7.9 _No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud/Willful Misconduct_ _._
The liability of any party under this _Article VII_ shall be in addition to,
and not exclusive of, any other liability that such party may have at law or
in equity based on such partys (a) fraudulent acts or omissions or (b)
willful misconduct. None of the provisions set forth in this Agreement shall
be deemed to be a waiver by or release of any party of any right or remedy
that such party may have at law or equity based on any other partys
fraudulent acts or omissions or willful misconduct nor shall any such
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit, (i) the amounts of recovery sought or
awarded in any such claim for fraud or willful misconduct, (ii) the time
period during which a claim for fraud or willful misconduct may be brought, or
(iii) the recourse that any such party may seek against another party with
respect to a claim for fraud or willful misconduct.

any federal or state court located in the State of Delaware) (the " _Delaware

litigation in the Delaware Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Delaware Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any

issues, and therefore each such party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (d) agrees to service
of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding shall be
effective if such process is given as a notice in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 8.1_ or in any manner prescribed by the Laws of the State of Delaware.
Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 

SECTION 8.3 _Entire Agreement; Amendments, Consents and Waivers_ _._ This
Agreement, the Support Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement and the
exhibits and schedules hereto and thereto constitute the entire agreement
between and among the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations
and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties, and there are no
warranties, representations or other agreements between or among the parties
in connection with the subject matter hereof except as set forth specifically
herein or contemplated hereby. Except as expressly set forth in this
Agreement (including the representations and warranties set forth in _Articles
III_ and _IV_ ), (a) the parties acknowledge and agree that neither the WPZ
Group Entities nor any other Person has made, and the Parent Group Entities
are not relying upon, any covenant, representation or warranty, expressed or

any information regarding any WPZ Group Entity furnished or made available to
any Parent Group Entity, (b) the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that,
except as set forth in this Agreement, neither the Parent Group Entities nor
any other Person has made, and the WPZ Group Entities are not relying upon,
any covenant, representation or warranty, expressed or implied, as to the

regarding any Parent Group Entity furnished or made available to any WPZ Group
Entity, and (c) the WPZ Parties and the Parent Parties shall not have or be
subject to any liability to any Parent Group Entity or any other Person or any
WPZ Group Entity or any other Person, as applicable, or any other remedy in
connection herewith, based upon the distribution to any Parent Group Entity
or any WPZ Group Entity of, or any Parent Group Entitys or any WPZ Group
Entitys use of or reliance on, any such information or any information,
documents or material made available to the Parent Group Parties or WPZ Group
Parties, as applicable, in any "data rooms," "virtual data rooms," management
presentations or in any other form in expectation of, or in connection with,
the transactions contemplated hereby. Subject to compliance with applicable
Law, prior to the Closing, any provision of this Agreement may be (a)
consented to or waived in writing by the party benefited by the provision or
(b) amended or modified at any time by an agreement in writing by the parties
hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in addition to any other approvals
required by the WPZ Parties constituent documents or under this Agreement,
the foregoing consents, waivers, amendments or modifications in clauses (a)
and (b), and any decision or determination by WPZ to (x) terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ or (y)
enforce this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.8_), must be
approved by, in the case of consents, waivers, amendments or modifications, or
such decisions or determinations, by any WPZ Party or the WPZ Board, the WPZ
Conflicts Committee. No amendment, supplement, modification or waiver of this

 



63  Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing by the parties hereto.
The failure of a party to exercise any right or remedy shall not be deemed or
constitute a waiver of such right or remedy in the future. No waiver of any
of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a
waiver of any other provision hereof (regardless of whether similar), nor
shall any such waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise
expressly provided.

SECTION 8.4 _Binding Effect; No Third-Party Beneficiaries; and Assignment_ _._
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. Nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and
assigns, any rights, benefits or obligations hereunder, except (i) as provided
in _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ and (ii) for the right of the Holders of WPZ Units to
receive the Merger Consideration, any Fractional Share Payment and any
distributions or dividends payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ after the Closing (a claim by the Holders of WPZ Units
with respect to which may not be made unless and until the Closing shall have
occurred). No party hereto may assign, transfer, dispose of or otherwise
