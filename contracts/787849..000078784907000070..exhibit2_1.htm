any action  to  be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to
fail to be taken,  which  action or failure to act could prevent the Merger
from qualifying as a  reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code.

(ii) If  the  Cash Election Number is less than the Cash Conversion Number
(the amount  by  which the Cash Conversion Number exceeds the Cash Election
Number being referred  to herein as the "Shortfall Number"), then all Cash
Election Shares shall be  converted into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration and the Non-Election  Shares and Stock Election Shares shall be
treated in the following  manner:

 

 

(A) If  the  Shortfall Number is less than or equal to the number of Non-
Election Shares,  then all Stock Election Shares shall be converted into the
right to receive  the  Stock Consideration, and the Non-Election Shares of
each holder thereof shall  convert into the right to receive the Cash
Consideration in respect of that  number of Non-Election Shares equal to the
product obtained by multiplying  (x)  the number of Non-Election Shares held
by such holder by (y) a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the Shortfall
Number and the denominator of which is  the  total number of Non-Election
Shares (with the Exchange Agent to determine,  consistent with Section
3.1.6(a), whether fractions of Non-Election Shares  shall  be rounded up or
down), with the remaining number of such holder's Non-Election  Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Stock Consideration;  or

 

 

(B) If  the  Shortfall Number exceeds the number of Non-Election Shares,
then all  Non-Election Shares shall be converted into the right to receive
the Cash  Consideration, and Stock Election Shares of each holder thereof
shall convert  into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in respect of
that number  of  Stock Election Shares equal to the product obtained by
multiplying (x) the  number of Stock Election Shares held by such holder by
(y) a fraction, the  numerator of which is the amount by which (1) the
Shortfall Number exceeds  (2)  the total number of Non-Election Shares, and
the denominator of which is  the  total number of Stock Election Shares
(with the Exchange Agent to determine,  consistent with Section 3.1.6 (a),
whether fractions of Stock Election Shares  shall be rounded up or down),
with the remaining number of such holder's Stock  Election Shares being
converted into the right to receive the Stock  Consideration.

Section  3.2. _Procedures  for Exchange of Yardville Common Stock_.

 

 

3.2.1. _Election  Procedures_. Each holder of record of shares of Yardville
Common  Stock ("Holder") shall have the right, subject to the limitations set
forth in  this Article 3, to submit an election in accordance with the
following  procedures:

 

 

(a) Each  Holder may specify in a request made in accordance with the
provisions of  this  Section 3.2.1 (herein called an "Election") (i) the
number of shares of  Yardville Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect
to which such Holder  desires to make a Stock Election and (ii) the number of
shares of Yardville  Common Stock owned by such Holder with respect to which
such Holder desires  to  make a Cash Election.

 

 

(b) Acquirer  shall prepare a form reasonably acceptable to Yardville (the
"Form of Election")  which shall be mailed to each holder of record of
Certificate(s) so as to  permit  such holders to exercise their right to
make an Election prior to the Election  Deadline.

 

 

(c) Acquirer  shall make the Form of Election initially available not less
than twenty  (20)  business days prior to the anticipated Election Deadline
and shall use all  reasonable efforts to make available as promptly as
possible a Form of Election  to any stockholder of Yardville who requests
such Form of Election following  the  initial mailing of the Forms of
Election and prior to the Election  Deadline.

 

 

(d) Any  Election shall have been made properly only if the person authorized
to receive  Elections and to act as Exchange Agent, pursuant to an agreement
(the "Exchange  Agent Agreement") entered into prior to the mailing of the
Form of Election to  Yardville stockholders, shall have received, by the
Election Deadline, a  Form of  Election properly completed and signed and
accompanied by Certificates to  which  such Form of Election relates or by
an appropriate customary guarantee of  delivery of such certificates, as set
forth in such Form of Election, from  a  member of any registered national
securities exchange or a commercial bank  or  trust company in the United
States; provided, that such Certificates are  in fact  delivered to the
Exchange Agent by the time required in such guarantee of  delivery. Failure
to deliver shares of Yardville Common Stock covered  by such a guarantee of
delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee  shall be deemed to
invalidate any otherwise properly made Election, unless  otherwise determined
by Acquirer, in its sole discretion. As used  herein, unless otherwise agreed
in advance by the parties, "Election Deadline" means 5:00 p.m. local time (in
the city in which the principal office of  the  Exchange Agent is located)
on the day prior to the Yardville Stockholders' Meeting. Yardville and
Acquirer shall cooperate to issue a press  release reasonably satisfactory to
each of them announcing the date of the  Election Deadline not more than
fifteen (15) business days before, and at  least  five (5) business days
prior to, the Election Deadline.

 

 

(e) Any  Yardville stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline, change  or  revoke his or her Election by written notice received
by the Exchange Agent  prior to the Election Deadline accompanied by a
properly completed and signed  revised Form of Election. Subject to the terms
of the Exchange Agent  Agreement, if Acquirer shall determine in its
reasonable discretion that  any  Election is not properly made with respect
to any shares of Yardville Common  Stock (neither Acquirer nor Yardville nor
the Exchange Agent being under  any  duty to notify any stockholder of any
such defect), such Election shall be  deemed to be not in effect, and the
shares of Yardville Common

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

Stock  covered by such Election shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be 
Non-Election Shares, unless a proper Election is thereafter timely  made.

 

 

 

(f) Any  Yardville stockholder may, at any time prior to the Election
Deadline,  revoke  his or her Election by written notice received by the
Exchange Agent prior  to  the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to
the Election Deadline of  his or  her Certificates, or of the guarantee of
delivery of such Certificates,  previously deposited with the Exchange Agent.
All Elections shall be  automatically deemed revoked upon receipt by the
Exchange Agent of written  notification from Acquirer or Yardville that this
Agreement has been terminated  in accordance with Article 11.

 

 

 

(g) Subject  to the terms of the Exchange Agent Agreement, Acquirer, in the
exercise of  its  reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all
determinations, not  inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing
(i) the validity  of the  Forms of Election and compliance by any Yardville
stockholder with the Election  procedures set forth herein, (ii) the manner
and extent to which Elections  are  to be taken into account in making the
determinations prescribed by Section  3.1.3, (iii) the issuance and delivery
of certificates representing the whole  number of shares of Acquirer Common
Stock into which shares of Yardville  Common  Stock are converted in the
Merger and (iv) the method of payment of cash  for  shares of Yardville
Common Stock converted into the right to receive the  Cash  Consideration
and cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquirer Common  Stock.

 

 

3.2.2. _Deposit  of Merger Consideration_. At or prior to the Effective
Time,  Acquirer shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the
Exchange  Agent  (i) certificates representing the number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock  sufficient to deliver, and Acquirer shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to  timely  deliver, the aggregate Stock Consideration, and
(ii) immediately available  funds  equal to the aggregate Cash Consideration
(together with, to the extent then  determinable, any cash payable in lieu of
fractional shares pursuant to Section  3.2.3(f)) (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund") and Acquirer shall instruct the  Exchange Agent to timely pay the Cash
Consideration, and such cash in lieu  of  fractional shares, in accordance
with this Agreement.

 

 

3.2.3. _Delivery  of Merger Consideration_.

 

 

(a) As  soon  as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall  mail to each holder of record of Certificate(s) which
immediately prior to  the  Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Yardville Common Stock whose  shares were converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration  pursuant to Section 3.1 and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Acquirer  Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor who did not properly  complete and submit an Election
Form (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall  specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to  Certificate(s) shall pass, only upon
delivery of Certificate(s) (or affidavits  of loss in lieu of such
Certificates) to the Exchange Agent and shall be  substantially in such form
and have such other provisions as shall be prescribed  by the Exchange Agent
Agreement (the "Letter of Transmittal") and (ii)  instructions for use in
surrendering Certificate(s) in exchange for the Merger  Consideration and any
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquirer Common  Stock  to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section  3.2.3(f) upon
surrender of such Certificate and any dividends or distributions  to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.2.3(c).

 

 

(b) Upon  surrender to the Exchange Agent of its Certificate or Certificates,
accompanied  by a properly completed Form of Election or a properly completed
Letter of  Transmittal, a holder of Yardville Common Stock will be entitled
to receive  promptly after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration (with
the aggregate  Cash Consideration paid to each such holder rounded to the
nearest whole  cent)  and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Acquirer
Common Stock to be  issued  or paid in consideration therefor in respect of
the shares of Yardville Common  Stock represented

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

by  its  Certificate or Certificates. Until so surrendered, each such 
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time, for all purposes, only 
the  right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional  shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor  upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance
with, and any dividends  or  distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to, this Section  3.2.

 

 

(c) No  dividends or other distributions with respect to Acquirer Common
Stock shall  be  paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with
respect to the shares  of Acquirer Common Stock represented thereby, in each
case until the surrender  of such Certificate in accordance with this Section
3.2. Subject to  the effect of applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar laws, following  surrender of any such Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.2, the  record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive,
without interest, (i)  the  amount of dividends or other distributions with
a record date after the  Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to
the whole shares of Acquirer  Common Stock represented by such Certificate
and not paid and/or (ii) at  the  appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions  payable  with respect to shares of
Acquirer Common Stock represented by such Certificate  with a record date
after the Effective Time (but before such surrender date)  and  with a
payment date subsequent to the issuance of the Acquirer Common Stock 
issuable with respect to such Certificate.

 

 

(d) In  the  event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate representing
Yardville  Common  Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer
records of Yardville,  the  proper amount of cash and/or shares of Acquirer
Common Stock shall be paid  or  issued in exchange therefor to a Person
other than the Person in whose name  the  Certificate so surrendered is
registered if the Certificate formerly  representing such Yardville Common
Stock shall be properly endorsed or otherwise  be in proper form for transfer
and the Person requesting such payment or  issuance shall pay any transfer or
other similar Taxes required by reason  of the  payment or issuance to a
Person other than the registered holder of the  Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Acquirer that the Tax has  been  paid or is not
applicable.

 

 

(e) After  the  Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of  Yardville of the shares of Yardville Common Stock that
were issued and  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time other
than to settle  transfers of Yardville Common Stock that occurred prior to
the Effective  Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing
such  shares are presented for transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be
cancelled  and exchanged for the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional  shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor  in accordance with the procedures set forth in this
Section 3.2.

 

 

(f) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
certificates or  scrip  representing fractional shares of Acquirer Common
Stock shall be issued upon  the  surrender of Certificates for exchange, no
dividend or distribution with  respect  to Acquirer Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional  share, and such fractional
share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof  to vote or to any other
rights of a stockholder of Acquirer. In lieu  of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Acquirer shall pay to each  former  stockholder of
Yardville who otherwise would be entitled to receive such  fractional share
an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined  by  multiplying
(i) the Acquirer Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of a share  (after taking
into account all shares of Yardville Common Stock held by such  holder at the
Effective Time and rounded to the nearest thousandth when  expressed in
decimal form) of Acquirer Common Stock to which such holder  would 
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.1.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

(g) Any  portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of  Yardville as of the first anniversary of the Effective Time
may, to the extent  permitted by applicable law, be paid to Acquirer. In such
event, any  former stockholders of Yardville who have not theretofore
complied with this  Section 3.2 shall thereafter look only to Acquirer with
respect to the Merger  Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional
shares and any unpaid  dividends and distributions on the Acquirer Common
Stock deliverable in respect  of each share of Yardville Common Stock such
stockholder holds as determined  pursuant to this Agreement, in each case,
without any interest  thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of
Acquirer, Yardville,  the Exchange Agent or any other Person shall be liable
to any former holder  of  shares of Yardville Common Stock for any amount
delivered in good faith to  a  public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar  laws.

 

 

 

(h) In  the  event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the  making  of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to  be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Acquirer or the Exchange  Agent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such amount as Acquirer  may  determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may  be  made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will  issue  in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger  Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this  Agreement.

 

 

 

3.2.4. _Withholding  Rights_. The Exchange Agent (or, subsequent to the
first  anniversary of the Effective Time, Acquirer) shall be entitled to
deduct  and  withhold from the cash portion of the Merger Consideration and
any cash in  lieu  of fractional shares of Acquirer Common Stock otherwise
payable pursuant  to this  Agreement to any holder of Yardville Common Stock
such amounts as the Exchange  Agent or Acquirer, as the case may be, is
required to deduct and withhold  under  the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax law, with respect  to  the making of such payment. To
the extent the amounts are so withheld  by the Exchange Agent or Acquirer, as
the case may be, such withheld amounts  shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to  the  holder of shares of Yardville
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction  and  withholding was made by
the Exchange Agent or Acquirer, as the case may  be.

 

 

Section  3.3. _Treatment  of Yardville Options_.

 

 

As  of the  Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part  of  the holders thereof, each Yardville Option, regardless of
whether or not  vested,  that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled  and shall only entitle the holder thereof
the right to receive, as soon as  reasonably practicable following the
Effective Time, a lump sum cash payment,  without interest, equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares subject  to  such Yardville Option and
(y) the excess, if any, of (i) the Per Share Amount  over (ii) the exercise
price per share of such Yardville Option; provided,  however, that Acquirer
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold such amounts  as  may be required
to be deducted and withheld under the Code and any applicable  state or local
Tax law. Prior to the Effective Time, Yardville shall  take all actions
necessary or advisable in order to effectuate the foregoing  provisions of
this Section 3.3.

 

 

Section  3.4. _Reservation  of Shares_.

 

 

Acquirer  shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of the
Acquirer  Common  Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of Acquirer Common
Stock to the  Yardville stockholders in accordance with this Article 3.

respect of which Yardville or any Yardville Subsidiary is an  obligor to any
Person, which instrument evidences or relates to indebtedness  other than
deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, bankers' acceptances,  and
"treasury tax and loan" accounts and transactions in "federal funds" in each 
case established in the ordinary course of business consistent with past 
practice, or which contains financial covenants or material restrictions 
(other  than prepayment penalties and those relating to the payment of
principal  and  interest when due) which would be applicable on or after the
Closing Date  to  Acquirer or any Acquirer Subsidiary; (vi) with a vendor of
products or services,  written or oral, that obligates Yardville or any

not  terminable without cause on 60 days' or less notice without penalty or

following consummation  of  the Merger, Acquirer or its Subsidiaries, (viii)
that is a "material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of

Yardville Securities Documents filed prior  to  the date hereof or (ix)
containing a "most favored nation" clause or other  similar term providing

4.9.2. Each  real  estate lease that requires the consent of the lessor or
its agent resulting  from  the Merger by virtue of the terms of any such
lease, is listed in YARDVILLE  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.2 identifying the
section of the lease that contains  such prohibition or restriction. Subject
to any consents that may be  required as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement,  neither  Yardville nor any Yardville
Subsidiary nor, to Yardville's Knowledge, any other  party, is in default in
any material respect under any material contract,  agreement, commitment,
arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument  to which it is a
party, by which its assets, business, or operations may  be  bound or
affected, or under which it or its assets, business, or operations  receive
benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse  of 
time or the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a  default.

 

 

4.9.3. True  and  correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments referred  to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available
to Acquirer on or  before  the date hereof, are listed on YARDVILLE
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.1 or YARDVILLE  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.9.2 and are in
full force and effect and, neither  Yardville nor any Yardville Subsidiary
has materially breached any provision  of,  or is in default in any respect
under any term of, any such contract,  arrangement or instrument. No party to
any material contract,  arrangement or instrument will have the right to
terminate any or all of  the  provisions of any such contract, arrangement
or instrument as a result of  the  execution of, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this  Agreement. No plan, contract, employment
agreement, termination  agreement, or similar agreement or arrangement to
which Yardville or any  Yardville Subsidiary is a party or under which
Yardville or any Yardville  Subsidiary may be liable contains provisions
which permit an employee or  independent contractor to terminate it without
cause and continue to accrue  future benefits thereunder. Except as set forth
in YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE  4.9.3, no such agreement, plan, contract,
or arrangement (x) provides for  acceleration in the vesting of benefits or
payments due thereunder upon the  occurrence of a change in ownership or
control of Yardville or any Yardville  Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a
subsequent event; or (y) requires  Yardville or any Yardville Subsidiary to

the execution of  this  Agreement, approval of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Yardville or  consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will, either  alone or in conjunction with any other event,
(A) result in any payment  (including, without limitation, severance,
unemployment compensation, "excess  parachute payment" (within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code), forgiveness  of indebtedness or otherwise)
becoming due to any director or any employee  of  Yardville or any Yardville
Subsidiary under any Yardville Compensation and  Benefit Plan, (B) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or trigger any  payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation  or  benefits under, increase

Yardville Compensation and Benefit Plan, (C)  result  in the breach or
violation of, or a default under, any Yardville Compensation  and Benefit
Plan, (D) limit or restrict the ability to merge, amend or terminate  any
Yardville Compensation and Benefit Plan or (E) result in any payment  which 
may be nondeductible for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section

Section  4.10. _Ownership  of Property; Insurance Coverage_.

 

 

4.10.1. Yardville  and each Yardville Subsidiary has good and, as to real
property, marketable  title to all material assets and properties owned by
Yardville or each Yardville  Subsidiary in the conduct of its businesses,
whether such assets and properties  are real or personal, tangible or
intangible, including assets and property  reflected in the balance sheets
contained in the Yardville Regulatory Reports  and in the Yardville Financial
Statements or acquired subsequent thereto  (except  to the extent that such
assets and properties have been disposed of in the  ordinary course of
business, since the date of such balance sheets), subject  to  no material
encumbrances, liens, mortgages, security interests or pledges,  except (i)
those items which secure liabilities for public or statutory  obligations or
any discount with, borrowing from or other obligations to  FHLB,  inter-bank
credit facilities, or any transaction by a Yardville Subsidiary  acting in a
fiduciary capacity, (ii) those reflected in the notes to the  Yardville
Financial Statements, and (iii) statutory liens for amounts not  yet 
delinquent or which are being contested in good faith (collectively
"Yardville  Permitted Encumbrances"). Yardville and the Yardville
Subsidiaries,  as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of
real and personal  properties used by Yardville and its Subsidiaries in the
conduct of their  businesses or otherwise reflected in the Yardville
Financial Statements to  occupy or use all such properties as presently
occupied and used by each  of them  and such right is free and clear of all
material encumbrances, liens, mortgages,  security interests or pledges of
any nature whatsoever, except for Yardville  Permitted Encumbrances. Such
existing leases and commitments to lease  constitute or will constitute
operating leases for both tax and financial  accounting purposes and the
lease expense and minimum rental commitments  with  respect to such leases
and lease commitments are as disclosed in all material  respects in the notes
to the Yardville Financial Statements. There  are no pending or, to
Yardville's Knowledge, threatened condemnation proceedings  against such
leased or owned real property. To Yardville's Knowledge,  Yardville and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable health  and  safety
related requirements for such owned and leased real property, including 
those under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Occupational 
Health and Safety Act of 1970.

 

 

4.10.2. Each  of  Yardville and its Subsidiaries has good title to all
securities owned by  it  (except those sold under repurchase agreements or
held in any fiduciary or  agency capacity), free and clear of any liens,
except to the extent such  securities are pledged in the ordinary course of
business to secure obligations  of Yardville or its Subsidiaries. Such
securities are valued on the  books of Yardville in accordance with GAAP in
all material  respects. Yardville and its Subsidiaries and their respective 
businesses employ investment, securities, commodities, risk management and 
other  policies, practices and procedures which Yardville believes are
prudent and  reasonable in the context of such businesses. With respect to
all  agreements pursuant to which Yardville or any Yardville Subsidiary has
purchased  securities subject to an agreement to resell, if any, Yardville or
such  Yardville Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security
interest  (which  to Yardville's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien)
in the securities or  other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and
the value of such  collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt
secured  thereby.

 

 

4.10.3. Yardville  and each Yardville Subsidiary currently maintain insurance
considered by  each of  them to be reasonable for their respective
operations. Neither  Yardville nor any Yardville Subsidiary has received
notice from any current  insurance carrier that: (i) such insurance will be
canceled or that coverage  thereunder will be reduced or eliminated; or (ii)
premium costs with respect  to  such policies of insurance will be
substantially increased. Except as  disclosed in YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE 4.10.3, there are presently no  material claims pending under such
policies of insurance and no notices have  been given by Yardville or any
Yardville Subsidiary under such  policies. All such insurance is valid and
enforceable and in full  force and effect, and within the last three years
Yardville and each Yardville  Subsidiary has received each type of insurance
coverage for which it has  applied  and during such periods has not been
denied indemnification for any material  claims submitted under any of its
insurance policies. YARDVILLE  DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.10.3 identifies all
material policies of insurance  maintained by Yardville and each Yardville
Subsidiary (other than those  providing for employee or director welfare or
similar benefits) as well as  the  other matters required to be disclosed
under this Section.

4.11.1. Except  as  set forth in YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE 4.11.1,
neither Yardville nor  any  Yardville Subsidiary is a party to any, and
there are no pending or, to the  best  of Yardville's Knowledge, threatened
legal, administrative, arbitration or other  proceedings, claims (whether
asserted or unasserted), actions or governmental  or  regulatory
investigations, (i) against Yardville or any Yardville Subsidiary  involving
a claim in excess of $250,000 or requesting equitable relief, (ii)  to 
which Yardville or any Yardville Subsidiary's assets are or may be subject, 
(iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the transactions 
contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could adversely affect the 
ability  of Yardville to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

to obtaining Regulatory Approvals.

December 31, 2004  or  has pending any proceeding, enforcement action or, to
Yardville's Knowledge,  investigation into the business, disclosures or
operations of Yardville or  any  Yardville Subsidiary. Except as set forth
in YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE  SCHEDULE 4.12.3, (a) since December 31, 2004, no

The  information relating to Acquirer and any Acquirer Subsidiary to be
contained  in  the Merger Registration Statement, or in any of the documents

to state a material  fact  necessary to make the statements therein, in

Section  5.19. _Internal  Controls_.

 

 

5.19.1. None  of  Acquirer or Acquirer Subsidiaries' records, systems,
controls, data or  information are recorded, stored, maintained, operated or
otherwise wholly  or  partly dependent on or held by any means (including
any electronic, mechanical  or photographic process, whether computerized or
not) that (including all  means  of access thereto and therefrom) are not
under the exclusive ownership and  direct control of it or its subsidiaries
or accountants except as would not  reasonably by expected to have a
materially adverse effect on  Acquirer. Acquirer (x) has implemented and
maintains disclosure  controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act)  to  ensure that material information relating to
Acquirer, including its  consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known to the
chief executive officer and  the  chief financial officer of Acquirer by
others within those entities, and  (y) has  disclosed, based on its most
recent evaluation prior to the date hereof,  to  Acquirer's outside auditors
and the audit committee of Acquirer's Board of  Directors (i) any significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the  design  or operation of
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in  Rule  13a-15(f) of
the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to adversely affect  Acquirer's
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial  information, and
(ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves  management or other
employees who have a significant role in Acquirer's internal  controls over
financial reporting. These disclosures were made in  writing by management to
Acquirer's auditors and audit committee and a copy has  previously been made
available to Acquirer. As of the date hereof,  there is no reason to believe
that Acquirer's outside auditors and Acquirer's  chief executive officer and
chief financial officer will not be able to give  the  certifications and
attestations required pursuant to the rules and regulations  adopted pursuant
to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without  qualification, when next
due.

 

 

5.19.2. Since  December 31, 2006, (i) through the date hereof, neither
Acquirer nor any  of the  Acquirer Subsidiaries has received or otherwise
had or obtained knowledge  of any  material complaint, allegation, assertion
or claim, whether written or oral,  regarding the accounting or auditing
practices, procedures, methodologies  or  methods of Acquirer or any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective internal  accounting controls, including any
material complaint, allegation, assertion  or  claim that Acquirer or any of
the Acquirer Subsidiaries has engaged in  questionable accounting or auditing
practices, and (ii) no attorney representing  Acquirer or any of the Acquirer
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by  Acquirer or any of the Acquirer
Subsidiaries, has reported evidence of a  material violation of securities
laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar  violation by Acquirer or any of
its officers, directors, employees or agents  to  the Board of Directors of
Acquirer or any committee thereof or to any director  or officer of Acquirer.

ongoing operations at such  times  as Acquirer may reasonably request.
Yardville will promptly notify  Acquirer of any material change in the normal

indemnify Yardville Bank for  any  out-of-pocket costs incurred therewith,
including fees, charges and the costs  of  reversing the conversion process,
if for any reason the Merger is not  consummated for any reason other than a
breach of this Agreement by Yardville,  or a termination of this Agreement

47  

 

 

 

 

 

6.2.3. Yardville  Bank shall provide Acquirer Bank, within fifteen (15)

defined in Statement of Financial  Accounting Standards No. 15, "Accounting
by Debtors and Creditors for Troubled  Debt Restructuring," (ii) loans on
nonaccrual, (iii) real estate owned, (iv) all  loans ninety (90) days or more

of all loan approvals, which schedule shall indicate the  loan  amount, loan
type and other material features of the loan.

 

 

6.2.4. Yardville  shall promptly inform Acquirer upon receiving notice of any
legal,  administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, demands, notices,

Section  6.3. _Access  to Properties and Records_.

 

 

In  order  to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the Bank Merger
and the  integration of the business and operations of the parties to this
Agreement,  subject to Section 12.1 hereof, Yardville shall permit Acquirer
and its  officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives,  reasonable access, upon reasonable notice and throughout
the period before  the  Effective Time, to its resources, personnel and
properties and those of the  Yardville Subsidiaries, and shall disclose and
make available to Acquirer  and  its officers, employees, counsel,
accountants and other authorized  representatives during normal business
hours all of its books, papers and  records relating to the assets,
properties, operations, obligations and  liabilities, including, but not
limited to, all books of account (including  the  general ledger), tax
records, minute books of directors' (other than minutes  that discuss any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any  Acquisition Proposal or
any other subject matter Yardville reasonably determines  should be treated
as confidential) and stockholders' meetings, organizational  documents,
Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings with any  regulatory
authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees, and any  other 
business activities or prospects in which Acquirer may have a reasonable 
interest; provided, however, that Yardville shall not be required to take 
any  action that would provide access to or to disclose information where
such  access  or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights or
business interests  or  confidences of any customer or other Person or would
result in the waiver  by it  of the privilege protecting communications
between it and any of its counsel;  provided, further, that the parties shall
make appropriate substitute disclosure  arrangements. Yardville shall
cooperate with Acquirer in preparing  for the integration of employees,
including by providing access  thereto, and transfer and conversion of
compensation and employee benefit  plans,  programs and arrangements, for
employees from those of Yardville to those  of  Acquirer or its appropriate
Subsidiary. Yardville shall upon  Acquirer's reasonable request provide
Acquirer with access to Yardville's  records and systems for the purpose of
allowing Acquirer to obtain account  and  transaction information in
connection with Acquirer's efforts to complete a  migration or integration of
such data into its systems and planning for  same. Such access shall include,
without limitation, computer data  linkage to Yardville's system prior to the
Effective Time if Acquirer deems that  to be reasonably necessary or
appropriate. Yardville hereby consents  to Acquirer sharing such information,
on a confidential basis and in compliance  with the provisions of the Gramm-
Leach-Bliley Act and any applicable  regulations, with such vendors as
Acquirer deems to be necessary or appropriate  for the purpose of preparing
for and implementing the required systems  integration or account migration.
Yardville shall provide and shall  request its auditors to provide Acquirer
with such historical financial  information regarding it (and related audit
reports and consents) as Acquirer  may reasonably request for securities
disclosure purposes. Acquirer  shall use commercially reasonable best efforts
to minimize any interference  with  Yardville's regular business operations
during any such access to Yardville's  property, books and records. Yardville
and each Yardville Subsidiary  shall permit Acquirer, at Acquirer's expense,
to cause a "phase I environmental  audit" and a "phase II environmental
audit" to be performed at any physical  location owned or occupied by
Yardville or any Yardville  Subsidiary.

and the Yardville  Subsidiaries made by its independent accountants and
copies of all internal  control reports submitted to Yardville by such
accountants in connection  with  each annual, interim or special audit of

6.4.2. As  soon  as reasonably available, but in no event later than the

Acquirer of the filing on the date  thereof. Yardville will furnish to
Acquirer copies of all documents,  statements and reports as it or any
Yardville Subsidiary shall send to its  stockholders, the FDIC, the Federal
Reserve, the OCC or any other Regulatory  Authority, except as legally
prohibited thereby. Within twenty-five  (25) days after the end of each
month, Yardville will deliver to Acquirer  a  consolidated balance sheet and
a consolidated statement of operations, without  related notes, for such
month prepared in accordance with current financial  reporting practices.

 

 

6.4.3. With  reasonable promptness, Yardville will furnish to Acquirer such
additional  financial data that Yardville possesses and as Acquirer may
reasonably request,  including without limitation, loan reports.

 

 

Section  6.5. _Maintenance  of Insurance_.

 

 

Yardville  shall maintain, and shall cause each Yardville Subsidiary to
maintain, insurance  in such amounts as Yardville deems reasonable to cover
such risks as are  customary in relation to the character and location of
their properties and  the  nature of their business.

 

 

Section  6.6. _Disclosure  Supplements_.

 

 

From  time  to time prior to the Effective Time, Yardville will promptly
supplement or  amend  the YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES delivered in
connection herewith with  respect  to any matter hereafter arising which, if
existing, occurring or known at  the  date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described  in  such YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any  information in such YARDVILLE
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered  materially inaccurate thereby.
No supplement or amendment to such  YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have
any effect for the purpose of (i)  determining satisfaction of the conditions

Section  6.7. _Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties_.

 

 

Yardville  shall use all reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all  consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Without
limiting the  generality of the foregoing, Yardville shall utilize the
services of a  professional proxy soliciting firm to provide assistance in
obtaining the  stockholder vote required to be obtained by it hereunder.

 

 

Section  6.8. _All  Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, Yardville agrees to use
all  reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to  do, or  cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable  laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

Section  6.9. _Failure  to Fulfill Conditions_.

 

 

In  the  event that Yardville determines that a condition to its obligation
to complete  the Merger or the Bank Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it
will not waive  that condition, it will promptly notify Acquirer.

 

 

Section  6.10. _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

From  and  after the date hereof until the termination of this Agreement,
neither  Yardville, nor any Yardville Subsidiary, nor any of their respective
officers,  directors, employees, representatives, agents or affiliates
(including, without  limitation, any investment banker, financial advisor,
attorney, accountant  or  other agent or representative retained by
Yardville or any of its Subsidiaries),  will, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, encourage or take any  other  action that is designed to
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public  information or
assistance) any inquiries or the making or implementation  of any  proposal
that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any  Acquisition
Proposal (as defined below), (ii) enter into or maintain or continue 
discussions or negotiate with any Person in furtherance of such inquiries 
or  (iii) enter into any agreement regarding any Acquisition Proposal or
authorize  or permit any of its officers, directors, or employees or any of
its  subsidiaries or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,
accountant  or other agent or representative retained by any of its
Subsidiaries to take  any  such action. Yardville shall notify Acquirer
orally (within one day)  and in writing (as promptly as practicable) after
receipt of any Acquisition  Proposal or any material modification of or
material amendment to any  Acquisition Proposal, or any request for nonpublic
information relating to  Yardville or any of its Subsidiaries or for access
to the properties, books  or  records of Yardville or any Subsidiary by any
Person or entity that informs  the  Board of Directors of Yardville or any
Subsidiary that it is considering  making,  or has made, an Acquisition
Proposal. Such notice to Acquirer shall  include all of the relevant details
relating to such inquiry, proposal,  modification or amendment which
Yardville or any of its Subsidiaries or any  such  officer, director,
employee, investment banker, financial advisor, attorney,  accountant or
other agent or representative may receive relating to any of  such  matters.
Yardville shall keep Acquirer fully informed, on a current  basis, of any
material changes in the status and any material changes or  modifications in
the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal, indication or  request. Yardville
shall also promptly, and in any event within 24  hours, notify Acquirer,
orally and in writing, if it enters into discussions  or  negotiations
concerning any Acquisition Proposal in accordance with the  following
sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained  in this Section
6.10 shall prohibit the Board of Directors of Yardville from  furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations,  with  any
Person that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if, and only to  the 
extent that, (A) the Board of Directors of Yardville determines in good
faith  that such Acquisition Proposal, if consummated, is reasonably likely
to result  in a transaction more favorable to Yardville's stockholders, (B)
the Board  of Directors of Yardville, after consultation with and after
considering  the  advice of outside legal counsel, determines in good faith
that the failure  to  furnish information to or enter into discussions with
such Person would be  reasonably likely to violate the Board of Directors of
Yardville's fiduciary  duties under New Jersey law; (C) such Acquisition
Proposal was not solicited  by  Yardville and did not otherwise result from
a breach of this Section 6.10  by  Yardville (such proposal that satisfies
(A), (B) and (C) being referred to  herein as a "Superior Proposal"); (D)
Yardville promptly (but in no event later  than 24 hours after receipt)
notifies Acquirer in writing of such inquiries,  proposals or offers received
by, any such information requested from, or  any  such discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued with  Yardville or any of
its representatives indicating, in connection with such  notice, the name of
such Person and the material terms and conditions of  any  inquiries,
proposals or offers, and receives from such Person an executed 
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to, and no less 
favorable to Yardville than, those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement;  and (E) the Yardville Stockholders Meeting has not  occurred.
Yardville shall promptly provide to Acquirer any non-public  information that
is provided to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal  or  its
representatives which was not previously provided to  Acquirer. For purposes
of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal or offer as to
any of the following (other than the  transactions contemplated hereunder)
involving Yardville or any of its  Subsidiaries: (i) any merger,
consolidation, share exchange, business  combination, or other similar
transactions; (ii) any sale, lease, share  exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition or change in control  of the consolidated
assets (including for this purpose the outstanding equity  securities of
subsidiaries of Yardville and securities of the entity surviving  any merger
or business combination including any of Yardville's Subsidiaries) of 
Yardville, or any of its Subsidiaries representing more than 25% of the fair 
market value of all the assets, net revenues or net income of Yardville and 
its  Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, immediately prior to such transaction;
(iii)  any  tender offer or exchange offer, or acquisition from Yardville,
pursuant to  which  any person (or group of persons) (other than Acquirer or
its affiliates)  directly or indirectly, acquires or would acquire more than
25% or more of  the  outstanding shares of capital stock of Yardville or
outstanding voting power  or  of any new series or new class of preferred
stock that would be entitled  to a  class or series vote with respect to the
Merger, or the filing of a registration  statement under the Securities Act
in connection therewith; (iv) or any other  consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization or similar transaction  involving Yardville or
any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement, as a result of which the holders of shares of  Yardville
immediately prior to such transactions do not, in the aggregate,  own  at
least 75% of the outstanding shares of common stock and the outstanding 
voting power of the surviving or resulting entity in such transaction 
immediately after the consummation thereof in substantially the same
proportion  as such holders held the shares of Yardville Common Stock
immediately prior  to  the consummation thereof, or (iv) any public
announcement of a proposal,  plan or  intention to do any of the foregoing
or any agreement to engage in any of  the  foregoing.

6.10.1. Yardville  and its Subsidiaries shall immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any  existing discussions or negotiations with any Persons
(other than Acquirer)  conducted heretofore with respect to any of the
foregoing, and shall use  reasonable best efforts to cause all Persons other
than Acquirer who have  been  furnished confidential information regarding
Yardville in connection with  the  solicitation of or discussions regarding
an Acquisition Proposal within the  12  months prior to the date hereof
promptly to return or destroy such  information. Yardville agrees not to, and
to cause its Subsidiaries  not to, release any third party from the
confidentiality and standstill  provisions of any agreement to which
Yardville or its Subsidiaries is or  may  become a party, and shall
immediately take all steps necessary to terminate  any  approval that may
have been heretofore given under any such provisions  authorizing any person
to make an Acquisition Proposal. Neither  Yardville nor the Board of
Directors of Yardville shall approve or take any  action to render
inapplicable to any Acquisition Proposal the New Jersey  Shareholders
Protection Act, Section 14A:10A-1 _et_ _seq._ of the  NJBCA, or any similar
Takeover Laws.

 

 

6.10.2. Yardville  shall ensure that the executive officers, directors,
agents and representatives  (including any investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants  or  other retained representatives) of
Yardville or its Subsidiaries are aware  of  the restrictions described in
this Section 6.10 as reasonably necessary to  avoid  violations thereof. It
is understood that any violation of the  restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.10 by any officer, director, employee,  agent or representative
(including any investment banker, financial advisor,  attorney, accountant or
other retained representative) of Yardville or its  Subsidiaries, at the
direction or with the consent of Yardville or its  Subsidiaries, shall be
deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.10 by  Yardville.

 

 

6.10.3. Nothing  contained in this Section 6.10 shall prohibit Yardville or
its Subsidiaries  from  taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position
required by Rule 14e-2(a)  or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

 

Section  6.11. _Reserves  and Merger-Related Costs_.

 

 

Yardville  agrees to consult with Acquirer with respect to its loan,
litigation and  real  estate valuation policies and practices (including
loan classifications and  levels of reserves). Acquirer and Yardville shall
also consult with  respect to the character, amount and timing of
restructuring charges to be  taken  by Yardville in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and  shall  take such charges as Acquirer
shall reasonably request, provided that no  such  actions need be effected
until the conditions set forth in Sections 9.1.  and 9.3  have been
satisfied and until Acquirer shall have irrevocably certified to  Yardville
that all conditions set forth in Article 9 to the obligation of  Acquirer to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the  delivery of
certificates or opinions) have been satisfied or, where legally  permissible,
waived. No action taken by Yardville in accordance with  this Section 6.11
shall constitute or be deemed to be a breach, violation  of or  failure to
satisfy any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, condition  or
other provision of this Agreement or otherwise be considered in determining 
whether any such breach, violation or failure to satisfy shall have 
occurred.

 

 

Section  6.12. _Takeover  Laws_.

 

 

If  any  Takeover Law may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement (other than with respect to any
Acquisition  Proposal), Yardville, in conjunction with Acquirer, and the
members of  Yardville's Board of Directors, in conjunction with Acquirer's
Board of  Directors, will use reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals
and take  such actions as are necessary (other than any action requiring the
approval  of  Yardville's stockholders other than as contemplated by Section
8.1) so that the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be
consummated as promptly  as  practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise act to eliminate  or  minimize the effects of any Takeover
Laws on any of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

Section  6.13. _Yardville  Warrants_.

 

 

Yardville  shall provide the holders of the Yardville Warrants with any
notice required  by  the terms of the Yardville Warrants as a result of the
entry into this Agreement  or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereunder.

ARTICLE  7

 

 

COVENANTS  OF ACQUIRER

 

 

Section  7.1. _Conduct  of Business_.

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except  with  the written consent of Yardville, Acquirer will not, and will
cause Acquirer  Bank not to, voluntarily take any action, unless required by
applicable law  or  regulation, that would: (i) adversely affect the ability
of the parties to  obtain any Regulatory Approval or other approvals of
Governmental Entities  required for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii)  materially adversely affect its ability to perform
its covenants and agreements  under this Agreement; (iii) result in any of
the conditions set forth in  Article  9 hereof not being satisfied, or any
of its representations or warranties  in  this Agreement becoming untrue as
of any date after the date hereof, subject  to  opportunity to cure as set
forth in Section 11.1.2.

 

 

Section  7.2. _Current  Information_.

 

 

During  the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
Acquirer  will  cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of  Yardville and report the general status of its financial
condition, operations  and business and matters relating to the completion of
the transactions  contemplated hereby, at such times as Yardville may
reasonably  request. Acquirer will promptly notify Yardville of any
material  change in the normal course of its business or in the operation of
its  properties and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, of any
governmental  complaints, investigations or hearings (or communications
indicating that  the  same may be contemplated), or the institution or the
threat of material  litigation involving Acquirer or any Acquirer Subsidiary.

 

 

Section  7.3. _Financial  and Other Statements_.

 

 

As  soon  as reasonably available, but in no event later than the date such
documents  are  filed with the SEC, Acquirer will deliver to Yardville the
Securities Documents  filed by it with the SEC under the Securities Laws.
Acquirer will  furnish to Yardville copies of all documents, statements and
reports as it  or  Acquirer Bank file with, or receive from, any Bank
Regulatory or other  Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the
Bank Merger.

 

 

Section  7.4. _Disclosure  Supplements_.

 

 

From  time  to time prior to the Effective Time, Acquirer will promptly
supplement or  amend  the ACQUIRER DISCLOSURE SCHEDULES delivered in
connection herewith with respect  to any matter hereafter arising which, if
existing, occurring or known at  the  date of this Agreement, would have
been required to be set forth or described  in  such ACQUIRER DISCLOSURE
SCHEDULE or which is necessary to correct any  information in such ACQUIRER
DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE which has been rendered  materially inaccurate thereby.
No supplement or amendment to such  ACQUIRER DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE shall have
any effect for the purpose of (i)  determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article 9 or (ii)  the  provisions of Article 11, and shall be
for informational purposes  only.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

Section  7.5. _Consents  and Approvals of Third Parties_.

 

 

Acquirer  shall use all reasonable best efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all  consents and approvals necessary or desirable for the
consummation of the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.6. _All  Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

 

Subject  to the terms and conditions herein provided, Acquirer agrees to use
all  reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to  do, or  cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable  laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.7. _Failure  to Fulfill Conditions_.

 

 

In  the  event that Acquirer determines that a condition to its obligation
to complete  the Merger or the Bank Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it
will not waive  that condition, it will promptly notify Yardville.

 

 

Section  7.8. _Employee  Benefits_.

 

 

7.8.1. Subject  to Section 4.9.4, Acquirer agrees that it will honor all
Yardville Compensation  and Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as
in effect immediately  before  the Effective Time as disclosed in the
YARDVILLE DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE, subject  to  any amendment or termination
thereof that may be required by the terms of  this  Agreement or permitted
by the terms of the applicable Yardville Compensation  and  Benefit Plans.
Acquirer will review all Yardville Compensation and  Benefit Plans that are
generally and uniformly provided to employees to  determine whether to
maintain, terminate or continue such plans. In  the event employee
compensation and/or benefits as currently provided by  Yardville or any
Yardville Subsidiary are changed or terminated by Acquirer,  in  whole or in
part, Acquirer shall provide Continuing Employees (as defined  below)  with
compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially 
similar  to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly situated
employees  of  Acquirer or its applicable Acquirer Subsidiary (as of the
date any such  compensation or benefit is provided). Continuing Employees who
become  participants in an Acquirer compensation and benefit plan shall, for
purposes  of  determining eligibility for and for any applicable vesting
periods of such  employee benefits only (and not for benefit accrual purposes
except for vacation  or as otherwise specifically set forth herein) be given
credit for meeting  eligibility and vesting requirements (except for vesting
requirements applicable  to any defined benefit pension plan maintained by
the Acquirer or its  Affiliates) in such plans for service as an employee of
Yardville or any  Yardville Subsidiary or any predecessor thereto prior to
the Effective  Time. For one year following the Effective Time, Continuing
Employees  shall participate in the Acquirer's Displaced Employee Assistance
Plan as it may  be in effect from time to time, provided, however, that the
level of cash  severance benefits payable thereunder shall equal the greater
of the benefits  payable under the Displaced Employee Assistance Plan or the
benefits which  would  have been payable under the Yardville Change in
Control Severance Compensation  Plan had it not been terminated. From and
after the one year  anniversary of the Effective Time, Continuing Employees
shall participate  in the  Acquirer's Displaced Employee Assistance Plan as
it may be in effect from time  to time. This Agreement shall not be construed
to limit the ability  of Acquirer or Acquirer Bank to terminate the
employment of any employee  or to  review employee benefits programs from
time to time and to make such changes  as  they deem appropriate.

 

 

7.8.2. In  the  event of any termination or consolidation of any Yardville
health plan with  any  Acquirer health plan, Acquirer shall make available
to employees of Yardville  or  any Yardville Subsidiary who are employed by
Acquirer or a Acquirer Subsidiary  at or after the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees") and their dependents  employer-provided health
coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage  to Acquirer
employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively  terminates coverage
under a Yardville health plan prior to the time that  such  Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate in the Acquirer health  plan,  no
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall 
terminate under any of the Yardville health plans prior to the time such 
Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate  in
the  health plans, programs and benefits generally available to all
employees  of  Acquirer and Acquirer Bank and their dependents. In the event
of a  termination or consolidation of any Yardville health plan, terminated
Yardville  employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to
continued coverage  under group health plans of Acquirer in accordance with
Code Section 4980B(f),  consistent with the provisions below. In the event of
any termination  of any Yardville health plan, or consolidation of any
Yardville health plan  with  any Acquirer health plan, any coverage
limitation under the Acquirer health  plan  due to any pre-existing
condition shall be waived by the Acquirer health  plan to  the degree that
such condition was covered by the Yardville health plan and  such  condition
would otherwise have been covered by the Acquirer health plan in  the 
absence of such coverage limitation. All Yardville Employees who  cease
participating in a Yardville health plan and become participants in  a 
comparable Acquirer health plan shall receive credit for any co-payment and 
deductibles paid under Yardville's health plan for purposes of satisfying
any  applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements under the Acquirer
health  plan, upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory to Acquirer that
such  co-payment and/or deductible has been satisfied.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

7.8.3. This  Agreement shall inure exclusively to the benefit of and be
binding upon the  parties hereto and their respective successors, assigns,
executors and legal  representatives. Without limiting the generality of
Section 12.5,  nothing in this Section 7.8, express or implied: (i) is
intended to confer  on  any person other than the parties hereto or their
respective successors and  assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or
liabilities under or by reason  of  this Agreement; (ii) shall require the
Acquirer to maintain any specific  Yardville Compensation and Benefit Plan or
to guarantee employment of any  employee for any period of time after the
Effective Time; and (iii) shall  constitute an amendment to any Yardville
Compensation and Benefit Plan or  any  Acquirer compensation or benefit plan
or arrangement.

 

 

Section  7.9. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

 

7.9.1. Acquirer  shall maintain in effect for six (6) years following the
Effective Time,  the  current directors' and officers' liability insurance
policies maintained by  Yardville (provided, that Acquirer may substitute
therefor policies of at  least  the same coverage containing terms and
conditions which are not materially  less  favorable) with respect to
matters occurring prior to or at the Effective  Time;  provided, however,
that in no event shall Acquirer be required to expend  in the  aggregate
pursuant to this Section 7.9.1 more than 150% of the annual cost  currently
expended by Yardville with respect to such insurance (the "Maximum  Amount");
_provided, further,_ that if the amount of the annual premium  necessary to
maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum  Amount,
Acquirer shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and 
officers' insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum  Amount. In
connection with the foregoing, Yardville agrees in order  for Acquirer to
fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers  liability insurance
policies for six years to provide such insurer or substitute  insurer with
such reasonable and customary representations as such insurer  may  request
with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

 

 

7.9.2. In  addition to 7.9.1, from and after the Effective Time, Acquirer
shall indemnify  and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at
any time before  the  date hereof, or who becomes before the Effective Time,
an officer or director  of  Yardville (the "Indemnified Parties") against
all losses, claims, damages,  costs, expenses (including attorney's fees),
liabilities or judgments or amounts  that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written  consent of Acquirer, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of  or in  connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether  civil, criminal,
or administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified  Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in  part on  or
arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was  a 
director or officer of Yardville or a Yardville Subsidiary if such Claim 
pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or occurring at or before 
the  Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger and the
other  transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is
asserted  or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Liabilities"),  to the fullest extent permitted under Yardville's Certificate
of Incorporation  or Bylaws to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Acquirer shall  pay reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) in advance of the  final disposition of any such action or proceeding
to each Indemnified Party  to  the full extent permitted by applicable state
or Federal law upon receipt  of an  undertaking to repay such advance
payments if he shall be adjudicated or  determined to be not entitled to
indemnification under this Section  7.9.2. Any Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under  this Section 7.9.2 upon learning of any Claim,
shall notify Acquirer (but  the  failure to so notify Acquirer shall not
relieve Acquirer from any obligations  which it may have under this Section
7.9.2, except to the extent such failure  materially prejudices Acquirer) and
shall deliver to Acquirer the undertaking  referred to in the previous
sentence. In the event of any such Claim  (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time) (1) Acquirer shall have  the  right to assume the
defense thereof (in which event the Indemnified Parties  will  cooperate in
the defense of any such matter) and upon such assumption Acquirer  shall not
be liable to any Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other  counsel
or any other expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party  in 
connection with the defense thereof (provided, however, that Acquirer shall 
not  settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect
to  any  Claim brought against such Indemnified Party, unless such
settlement, compromise  or consent includes an unconditional release of such
Indemnified Party from  all  liability arising with respect to such Claim or
such Indemnified Party otherwise  consents), except that if Acquirer elects
not to assume such defense, or  legal  counsel for the Indemnified Parties
reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties  that there are or may be (whether
or not any have yet actually arisen) issues  which raise conflicts of
interest between Acquirer and the Indemnified Parties,  the Indemnified
Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to them,  and  Acquirer
shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the 
Indemnified Parties, (2) Acquirer shall be obligated pursuant to this
paragraph  to pay for only one firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
whose reasonable  fees and expenses shall be paid promptly as statements are
received, (3)  Acquirer shall not be liable for any settlement effected
without its prior  written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned  or delayed), and (4) no indemnification shall be
available to the extent  the  person seeking indemnification has not acted
in good faith and in a manner  such  person reasonably believed to be in or
not opposed to the best interests  of  Yardville or a Yardville Subsidiary
or its successor, and with respect to  any  criminal proceeding, had
reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful,  such determination to
be made by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of  the  Directors of
Acquirer who are not involved in such proceeding.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

7.9.3. Acquirer  shall pay all expenses (including attorneys' fees) that may
be reasonably  incurred by an Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other  obligations of Acquirer under this Section 7.9; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,  that Acquirer shall not be required to pay such expenses
contemplated and  shall  be entitled to repayment of any advance payments of
such expenses from an  Indemnified Party if it is adjudicated or determined
that such Indemnified  Party  is not entitled to indemnity under this
Section 7.9.

 

 

7.9.4. In  the  event that either Acquirer or any of its successors or
assigns, to the extent  not assumed by operation of law, transfers all or
substantially all of its  properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, proper  provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Acquirer shall  assume the obligations set forth in this Section
7.9.

 

 

7.9.5. The  obligations of Acquirer provided under this Section 7.9 are
intended to be  enforceable against Acquirer directly by the Indemnified
Parties and shall  be  binding on all respective successors and permitted
assigns of  Acquirer.

 

 

Section  7.10. _Stock  Listing_.

 

 

Acquirer  agrees to list on the Stock Exchange (or such other national
securities exchange  on which the shares of the Acquirer Common Stock shall
be listed as of the  date  of consummation of the Merger), subject to
official notice of issuance, the  shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger.

 

 

Section  7.11. _Stock  Reserve_.

 

 

Acquirer  agrees at all times from the date of this Agreement until the
Merger  Consideration has been paid in full to reserve a sufficient number of
shares  of  its common stock to fulfill its obligations under this
Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.12. _Section  16(b) Exemption_.

 

 

Acquirer  and Yardville agree that, in order to most effectively compensate
and retain  Yardville Insiders in connection with the Merger, both prior to
and after  the  Effective Time, it is desirable that Yardville Insiders not
be subject to  a risk  of liability under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
to the fullest extent  permitted by applicable law in connection with the
conversion of shares of  Yardville Common Stock into shares of Acquirer in
the Merger, and for that  compensatory and retentive purpose agree to the
provisions of this Section  7.12. Assuming that Yardville delivers to
Acquirer the Yardville  Section 16 Information in a timely fashion prior to
the Effective Time, the  Board of Directors of Acquirer, or a committee of
non-employee directors  thereof  (as such term is defined for purposes of
Rule 16b-3(d) under the Exchange  Act),  shall reasonably promptly
thereafter and in any event prior to the Effective  Time adopt a resolution
providing in substance that the receipt by the Yardville  Insiders (as
defined below) of Acquirer Common Stock in exchange for shares  of 
Yardville Common Stock and/or New Options for Yardville Options, pursuant  to
the  transactions contemplated hereby and to the extent such securities are
listed  in  the Yardville Section 16 Information, are intended to be exempt
from liability  pursuant to Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act to the
fullest extent permitted  by applicable law. "Yardville Section 16
Information" means  information accurate in all material respects regarding
the Yardville Insiders,  the number of shares of Yardville Common Stock held
by each such Yardville  Insider and expected to be exchanged for Acquirer
Common Stock in the  Merger. "Yardville Insiders" means those officers and
directors of  Yardville who are subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a)  of the  Exchange Act and who are expected to be subject to
Section 16(a) of the Exchange  Act with respect to Acquirer Common Stock
subsequent to the Effective  Time.

8.1.1. Yardville  will promptly take all steps necessary to duly call, give
notice of, convene  and  hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Yardville
Stockholders Meeting"), for  the purpose of considering this Agreement and
the Merger as soon as practicable  after the Merger Registration Statement is
declared  effective. Subject to the next sentence, the Board of Directors
of  Yardville has adopted resolutions recommending to the stockholders of
Yardville  the adoption of this Agreement and shall (i) recommend approval of
this  Agreement by the Yardville stockholders, (ii) take all reasonable
lawful  action  to solicit approval of this Agreement by the Yardville
stockholders and (iii)  not withdraw, modify or change in any manner adverse
to Acquirer such favorable  recommendation. The Board of Directors of
Yardville may withdraw,  modify or qualify any such recommendation only in
connection with a Superior  Proposal and only if the Board of Directors of
Yardville determines, in good  faith after consultation with its outside
financial and legal advisors, that  the  failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to violate its fiduciary  obligations under applicable
law. Notwithstanding any such  withdrawal, modification, or qualification,
this Agreement and such other  matters shall be submitted to the stockholders
for the purpose of approving  the  Agreement and such other matters, and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed  to relieve Yardville of such
obligation, _provided_ , _however_ , that  if the Board of Directors of
Yardville shall have withdrawn, modified or  qualified its recommendation,
then in submitting this Agreement to stockholders  of Yardville, the Board of
Directors of Yardville may submit this Agreement  to  the stockholders of
Yardville without recommendation (although the resolutions  approving and
adopting this Agreement as of the date hereof may not be rescinded  or
amended), in which event the board of directors of Yardville may communicate 
the basis for its lack of a recommendation to the stockholders of Yardville 
in  the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or an appropriate amendment or
supplement  thereto  to the extent required by law.

 

 

8.1.2. Yardville  may postpone or adjourn the Yardville Stockholders Meeting
to the extent  the  parties reasonably believe is necessary to ensure than
any supplement or  amendment to the Proxy Statement-Prospectus (as defined
below) is provided  sufficiently in advance of a stockholder vote on this
Agreement and the Merger,  including, without limitation, in connection with
any amendment of the Proxy  Statement-Prospectus contemplated by Section
8.2.3.

 

 

Section  8.2. _Proxy  Statement-Prospectus_.

 

 

8.2.1. For  the  purposes (x) of registering Acquirer Common Stock to be
offered to holders  of  Yardville Common Stock in connection with the Merger
with the SEC under the  Securities Act and (y) of holding the Yardville
Stockholders Meeting, Acquirer  and Yardville shall jointly draft and prepare
the Merger Registration Statement,  including a proxy statement of Yardville
and prospectus of Acquirer satisfying  all applicable requirements of
applicable state securities and banking laws,  and  of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations  thereunder (such proxy
statement/prospectus in the form mailed to the Yardville  stockholders,
together with any and all amendments or supplements thereto,  being  herein
referred to as the "Proxy Statement-Prospectus"). The parties  shall use
their reasonable best efforts to file the Merger Registration  Statement,
including the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, with the SEC within  45 days 
after the date hereof. Each of Acquirer and Yardville shall use their 
reasonable best efforts to have the Merger Registration Statement declared 
effective under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such 
filing,  and Yardville shall thereafter promptly mail the Proxy Statement-
Prospectus  to  its stockholders. Acquirer shall also use its reasonable
best efforts  to obtain all necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky"
permits and approvals  required to carry out the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and  Yardville shall furnish all information concerning
Yardville and the holders  of  Yardville Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with  any  such action.

 

 

8.2.2. Each  party shall provide the other with any information concerning
itself that  the  other may reasonably request in connection with the
drafting and preparation  of  the Proxy Statement-Prospectus, and each party
shall notify the other promptly  of the receipt of any comments of the SEC
with respect to the Proxy  Statement-Prospectus and of any requests by the
SEC for any amendment or  supplement thereto or for additional information
and shall provide to the  other  promptly copies of all correspondence
between such party or any of their  representatives and the SEC. No filing of
the Merger Registration  Statement, including any amendment thereto shall be
made without the parties  each having the opportunity to review, comment on
and revise the Merger  Registration Statement. Each of Acquirer and Yardville
agrees to use  all reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other
party hereto,  to  respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by
the SEC and to cause  the Proxy Statement-Prospectus and all required
amendments and supplements  thereto to be mailed to the holders of Yardville
Common Stock entitled to  vote  at the Yardville Stockholders Meeting hereof
at the earliest practicable  time.

8.2.3. Yardville  and Acquirer shall promptly notify the other party if at
any time it becomes  aware that the Proxy Statement-Prospectus or the Merger
Registration Statement  contains any untrue statement of a material fact or
omits to state a material  fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements contained  therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not  misleading. In such event, Yardville shall
cooperate with Acquirer in  the preparation of a supplement or amendment to
such Proxy Statement-Prospectus  that corrects such misstatement or omission,
and Acquirer shall file an amended  Merger Registration Statement with the
SEC, and Yardville shall mail an amended  Proxy Statement-Prospectus to the
Yardville stockholders.

 

 

Section  8.3. _Regulatory  Approvals_.

 

 

Each  of  Yardville and Acquirer will cooperate with the other and use all
reasonable  best  efforts to promptly prepare all necessary documentation,
to effect all necessary  filings and to obtain all necessary permits,
consents, waivers, approvals  and  authorizations of the SEC, the Bank
Regulators and any other third parties  and  governmental bodies necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement. Yardville
and Acquirer will furnish each other and  each other's counsel with all
information concerning themselves, their  subsidiaries, directors, officers
and stockholders and such other matters  as may  be necessary or advisable
in connection any application, petition or any  other  statement or
application made by or on behalf of Yardville or Acquirer to  any  Bank
Regulator or other Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger  and 
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Yardville and 
Acquirer shall have the right to review and approve in advance all 
characterizations of the information relating to Yardville or Acquirer, as 
the  case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appear in
any  filing made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement  with any Bank Regulator or other Governmental Entity. In
exercising  the foregoing right, each of the parties shall act reasonably and
as promptly  as  practicable. The parties shall consult with each other with
respect  to the obtaining of all permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of  all  third parties and Governmental Entities necessary or
advisable to consummate  the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and each party will keep the  other  apprised of the status of matters
relating to completion of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing,  nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
require Acquirer to take any  action,  or commit to take any action, or
agree to any condition or restriction, in  connection with obtaining the
foregoing permits, consents, approvals and  authorizations of third parties
or Governmental Entities, that would reasonably  be expected to have a
material adverse effect (measured on a scale relative  to  Yardville and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) on Acquirer, Yardville  or the  Surviving
Corporation (a "Materially Burdensome Regulatory  Condition"). In addition,
Yardville agrees to cooperate and use its  reasonable best efforts to assist
Acquirer in preparing and filing such  petitions and filings, and in
obtaining such permits, consents, approvals  and  authorizations of third
parties and Governmental Entities, that may be necessary  or advisable to
effect any mergers and/or consolidations of Subsidiaries  of  Yardville and
Acquirer following consummation of the Merger.

 

 

Section  8.4. _Affiliates_.

 

 

Yardville  shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause each director,
executive officer  and other person who is an "affiliate" (for purposes of
Rule 145 under the  Securities Act) of Yardville to deliver to Acquirer, as
soon as practicable  after the date of this Agreement, and at least thirty
(30) days prior to  the  date of the Yardville Stockholders Meeting, a
written agreement, in the form  of  _Exhibit C_ hereto.

 

 

 

 

 

Section  8.5. _Yardville  Trust Preferred Securities_.

 

 

8.5.1. Yardville  shall cooperate with Acquirer to permit Acquirer to assume
the obligations  of  Yardville under the Indentures and the Guarantees
related to each Yardville  Trust and to receive the transfer of the Common
Securities related to each  Yardville Trust, including by causing Yardville's
counsel to deliver such  opinions as the Trustee of each Yardville Trust may
reasonably require with  respect to the assumption of the Yardville Trust
Preferred  Securities.

 

 

8.5.2. From  and  after the date hereof and until and including the Closing
Date, Yardville  shall  (i) pay, or accrue, as applicable , and cause the
Yardville Trusts to pay,  or  accrue, as applicable, all amounts due (when
and as due) and comply, and  cause  each Yardville Trust to comply, with all
of its obligations under the Indentures  and the Guarantees related to the
Yardville Trusts, and such other transaction  documents (together the
"Operative Documents"), and (ii) not enter into any  agreement (or amend,
alter or agree to amend or alter any Operative Document  or  other
agreement) with the Yardville Trusts.

TERMINATION,  AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

 

 

Section  11.1. _Termination_.

 

 

This  Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing Date,
whether  before or after approval of the Merger by the stockholders of 
Yardville:

 

 

11.1.1. By  the  mutual written agreement of each of Acquirer and Yardville;

 

 

11.1.2. By  either  party (provided, that the terminating party is not then
in material breach  of  any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein)  if  there shall have been a breach of any of
the representations or warranties  set  forth in this Agreement on the part
of the other party, which breach by its  nature cannot be cured prior to the
Termination Date or shall not have been  cured within thirty (30) days after
written notice of such breach by the  terminating party to the other party
provided, however, that neither party  shall  have the right to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 11.1.2  unless the breach of
representation or warranty, together with all other  such  breaches, would
entitle the terminating party not to consummate the transactions 
contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.1 (in the case of a breach of a 
representation or warranty by Yardville) or Section 9.3.1 (in the case of 
a  breach of a representation or warranty by Acquirer);

 

 

11.1.3. By  either  party (provided, that the terminating party is not then
in material breach  of  any representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained herein)  if  there shall have been a failure to perform
or comply with any of the covenants  or agreements set forth in this
Agreement on the part of the other party,  which  failure by its nature
cannot be cured prior to the Termination Date or shall  not  have been cured
within thirty (30) days after written notice of such failure  by  the
terminating party to the other party provided, however, that neither  party 
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 
11.1.3  unless the breach of covenant or agreement, together with all other
such  breaches, would entitle the terminating party not to consummate the
transactions  contemplated hereby under Section 9.2.2 (in the case of a
breach of covenant  by  Yardville) or Section 9.3.2 (in the case of a breach
of covenant by  Acquirer);

 

 

11.1.4. At  the  election of either party if the Closing shall not have
occurred by the  Termination Date, or such later date as shall have been
agreed to in writing  by  Acquirer and Yardville; provided, that no party
may terminate this Agreement  pursuant to this Section 11.1.4 if the failure
of the Closing to have occurred  on or before said date was due to such
party's material breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or other
agreement contained in this  Agreement;

 

 

11.1.5. By  either  party if the stockholders of Yardville shall have voted
at the Yardville  Stockholders Meeting on this Agreement and such vote shall
not have been  sufficient to approve this Agreement, provided, however, that
the right to  terminate this Agreement under this Section 11.1.5 shall not be
available  to  Yardville if it failed to comply with its obligations under
Section  6.10;

 

 

11.1.6. By  either  party if (i) final action has been taken by a Bank
Regulator whose approval  is  required in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated  hereby, which final action (x) has become
final and nonappealable and (y)  does  not approve this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii)  any  court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity shall have issued  an order,
decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining  or 
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other 
action  shall have become final and nonappealable;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

11.1.7. By  Acquirer if Yardville shall have breached Section 6.10 or
Section  8.1;

 

 

11.1.8. By  Acquirer, if the Board of Directors of Yardville shall have (i)
failed to  recommend in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus the approval of this
Agreement  or  (ii) in a manner adverse to Acquirer, (x) withdrawn, modified
or qualified,  or  proposed to withdraw, modify or qualify, the
recommendation by such Board  of  Directors of this Agreement and/or the
Merger to Yardville's stockholders, or  (y) recommended any Acquisition
Proposal (or, in the case of clause (ii),  resolved to take any such action),
whether or not permitted by the terms  hereof;  or

 

 

11.1.9. By  Yardville, in its sole discretion, if (either before or after the
approval  of  this Agreement by the Yardville stockholders) its Board of
Directors so  determines at any time during the three business day period
commencing with  (and  including) the Determination Date (as defined below),
if, as of the  Determination Date, both of the following conditions are
satisfied:

 

 

(a) the  Determination Date Value (as defined below) is less than the product
of 0.85  and  the Initial Value (as defined below); and

 

 

(b) the  number obtained by dividing the Acquirer Average Price (as defined
below)  by  $71.84 (such number, the "Acquirer Ratio") shall be less than
the number  obtained by dividing the Average Index Value (as defined below)
by the Initial  Index Price and subtracting 0.15 from such number (such
number less 0.15,  the "Index Ratio").

 

 

Notwithstanding  the foregoing, if Yardville elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant  to  this Section 11.1.9, then during the
seventy-two hour period commencing with  the  receipt by Acquirer of the
notice required pursuant to the last paragraph  of  this Section 11.1,
Acquirer shall have the option of increasing the Merger  Consideration to be
paid to the Yardville stockholders under Section 3.1  by  adjusting the
Share Ratio to equal the lesser of (i) the number (rounded  to the  nearest
one-ten-thousandth) that would cause the Determination Date Value  to be 
equal to the product of 0.85 and the Initial Value, and (ii) the number
equal  to  a quotient (rounded to the nearest one-ten-thousandth), the
numerator of  which  is the Index Ratio multiplied by the Share Ratio (as
then in effect) and  the  denominator of which is the Acquirer Ratio.

 

 

If  Acquirer makes an election contemplated by the preceding sentence
within  such  seventy-two hour period, it shall give prompt written notice
to Yardville  of  such election and the revised Share Ratio, whereupon no
termination shall  have  occurred pursuant to this Section 11.1.9 and this
Agreement shall remain  in  effect in accordance with its terms (except as
the Share Ratio shall have  been  so modified), and any references in this
Agreement to the Share Ratio shall  thereafter be deemed to refer to the
Share Ratio as adjusted pursuant to  this  Section 11.1.9 (together with any
additional adjustments pursuant to Section  3.1.5).

 

 

As  used  in this Section 11.1.9, the following terms have the following 
meanings.

 

 

"Acquirer  Average Price" means the arithmetic mean of the closing sales
prices per share  of Acquirer Common Stock on the Stock Exchange as reported
by The Wall Street  Journal for the five consecutive Stock Exchange trading
days ending at the  close  of trading on the Determination Date.

 

 

"Average  Index Value" means the sum of the Final Prices for each company
comprising the  Index Group multiplied by the weight set forth on Exhibit C
opposite the  name of  the applicable company, as they may be adjusted in
accordance  herewith.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

"Determination  Date" means the later of (i) the date on which the last
required Regulatory  Approval is obtained with respect to the Merger, without
regard to any requisite  waiting period and (ii) the business day immediately
preceding the date of  the  Yardville Stockholders Meeting; provided,
however, that if the Determination  Date would occur more than fifteen days
prior to the Closing Date, the  Determination Date shall mean the third
business day prior to the Closing  Date. For the avoidance of doubt, there
shall be only one  Determination Date.

 

 

"Determination  Date Value" means the sum of (i) the Cash Component; plus
(ii) the product of  (y) the aggregate Stock Consideration, multiplied by (z)
the Acquirer Average  Price.

 

 

"Final  Price" means, with respect to any company belonging to the Index
Group, the  arithmetic average of the daily closing sales prices of a share
of common  stock  of such company, as reported on the consolidated
transaction reporting system  for the market or exchange on which such common
stock is principally traded  (as  reported by the Wall Street Journal or, if
not reported thereby, another  authoritative source) for the same trading
days used in calculating the Acquirer  Average Price.

 

 

"Index  Group" means the twelve financial institution holding companies
listed on  Exhibit C attached hereto, the common stock of all of which shall
be publicly  traded and as to which there shall not have been a publicly
announced proposal  for the acquisition of any such company or as to which
any such company shall  have made a proposal to acquire another company in
which 20% or more of its  outstanding shares would be issued, in each case at
any time during the period  beginning on the date of this Agreement and
ending on the Determination  Date. In the event that, at any time during the
period beginning on  the date of this Agreement and ending on the
Determination Date, the common  stock of any such company ceases to be
publicly traded, a proposal to acquire  any such company is announced, or
such company announces an acquisition proposal  in which 20% or more of such
company's outstanding shares are to be issued, such  company will be removed
from the Index Group, and the weights (which have  been  evenly distributed)
attributed to the remaining companies will be adjusted  so  that they remain
evenly distributed for purposes of determining the Final  Index  Price and
the Initial Index Price. The twelve financial institution  holding companies
and the weights attributed to them are listed on Exhibit  C.

 

 

"Initial  Index Price" $49.83.

 

 

"Initial  Value" shall mean $403,354,213.

 

 

The  party  desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
11.1 shall  give  written notice of such termination to the other party in
accordance with  Section  12.4, specifying the provision or provisions
hereof pursuant to which such  termination is effected.

 

 

Section  11.2. _Effect  of Termination_.

 

 

11.2.1. In  the  event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to any
provision of Section  11.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and
have no further force,  except that (i) the provisions of this Section 11.2
and Article 12, and any  other Section which, by its terms, relates to post-
termination rights or  obligations, shall survive such termination of this
Agreement and remain  in full  force and effect.

 

 

11.2.2. If  this  Agreement is terminated, expenses and damages of the
parties hereto shall  be  determined as follows:

 

 

(a) Except  as  provided below, whether or not the Merger is consummated,
all costs and expenses  incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses; provided  that  costs and expenses of printing and
mailing the Proxy Statement-Prospectus  and  all filing and other fees paid
to the SEC in connection with the Merger,  which  shall be borne equally by
Yardville and Acquirer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

62  

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In  the  event of a termination of this Agreement because of a willful
breach of any  representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement,  the  breaching party shall remain liable for any and all
damages, costs and expenses,  including all reasonable attorneys' fees,
sustained or incurred by the  non-breaching party as a result thereof or in
connection therewith or with  respect to the enforcement of its rights
hereunder.

 

 

(c) As  a  condition of Acquirer's willingness, and in order to induce
Acquirer, to enter  into this Agreement, and to reimburse Acquirer for
incurring the costs and  expenses related to entering into this Agreement and
consummating the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Yardville
hereby agrees to pay  Acquirer, and Acquirer shall be entitled to payment of
a fee in an amount  equal  to **$14,000,000** (the "Acquirer Fee"), within
two (2) business  days following the occurrence of any of the events set
forth below:

 

 

(i) The  entering into a definitive agreement by Yardville relating to an
Acquisition  Proposal or the consummation of an Acquisition Proposal
involving Yardville  before the twelve month anniversary of the occurrence of
any of the  following: (I) the termination of this Agreement by Acquirer
pursuant  to Section 11.1.2 or 11.1.3 because of a willful breach by
Yardville; or  (II) the termination of this Agreement by Acquirer pursuant to
Section  11.1.5 if prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal shall
have been  publicly announced or shall have become publicly known to
Yardville or shall  have been communicated directly to the stockholders of
Yardville;  or

 

 

(ii) Acquirer  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 11.1.7 or
11.1.8.

 

 

(d) In  no  event will Acquirer or Yardville have any claim against the
officers or  directors of Yardville or Acquirer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries  if  this Agreement is terminated for any reason whatsoever.

 

 

(e) Yardville  acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section
11.2 are an integral  part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without  these  agreements, Acquirer would not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if  Yardville fails promptly to pay the
amount due pursuant to this Section 11.2,  and, in order to obtain such
payment, Acquirer commences a suit which results  in  a judgment against
Yardville for the fee set forth in this Section 11.2,  Yardville shall pay to
Acquirer its costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit.

 

 

Section  11.3. _Amendment,  Extension and Waiver_.

 

 

Subject  to applicable law, at any time prior to the Effective Time (whether
before  or  after approval thereof by the stockholders of Yardville), the
parties hereto  by  action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, may (a)  amend this Agreement, (b) extend the time for the
performance of any of the  obligations or other acts of any other party
hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies  in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document  delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) waive
compliance with any of the agreements  or  conditions contained herein;
_provided_ , _however_ , that after any  approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby by the  stockholders of Yardville, there may
not be, without further approval of  such  stockholders, any amendment of
this Agreement which reduces the amount, value  or  changes the form of
consideration to be delivered to Yardville's stockholders  pursuant to this
Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except  by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties  hereto. Any agreement on the
part of a party hereto to any extension  or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed  on  behalf of such party, but such
waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance  with such obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate  as a  waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other  failure.

This  Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the
parties  hereto and their respective successors and assigns; provided,
however, that  neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder  shall be assigned by any party hereto without the

65  

 

 

 

 

 

Section  12.10. _Interpretation_.

 

 

When  a  reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections or
Exhibits, such  reference shall be to an Article, Section of or Exhibit to
this Agreement  unless  otherwise indicated. The Recitals hereto constitute
an integral part  of this Agreement. References to Sections include
subsections, which  are part of the related Section (e.g., a section numbered
"Section 5.5.1" would  be part of "Section 5.5" and references to "Section
5.5" would also refer to  material contained in the subsection described as
"Section  5.5.1"). The table of contents, index and headings contained in
this  Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any
way  the  meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the
words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be  deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The
phrases "the date of this Agreement", "the date hereof" and terms of similar
import,  unless the context otherwise requires, shall be deemed to refer to
the date  set  forth in the preamble to this Agreement. This Agreement shall
not be  interpreted or construed to require any person to take any action, or
fail  to  take any action, if to do so would violate any applicable law.

 

 

Section  12.11. _Covenants  with Respect to Subsidiaries and Affiliates_.

 

 

Insofar  as any provision of the Agreement shall require a subsidiary or an
affiliate  of  a party to take or omit to take any action, such provision
shall be deemed  a  covenant by Acquirer or Yardville, as the case may be,
to cause such action  or  omission to occur.

 

 

Section  12.12. _Waiver  of Jury Trial_.

 

 

Each  party hereto acknowledges and agrees that any controversy which may
arise  under  this Agreement is likely to involve complicated and difficult
issues, and  therefore each party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives any right  such party may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation, directly  or  indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this
Agreement, or the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
certifies and acknowledges  that (a) no representative, agent or attorney of
any other party has  represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in  the  event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing
waiver, (b) each party  understands and has considered the implications of
this waiver, (c) each  party  makes this waiver voluntarily, and (d) each
party has been induced to enter  into  this Agreement by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications  in  this Section 12.12.

 

 

Section  12.13. _Specific  Performance_.

 

 

The  parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any
provision  of  this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the
terms hereof, and,  accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions  to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to
enforce specifically the performance  of the terms and provisions hereof in
any federal court located in the State  of  New Jersey (or, to the extent
that subject matter or personal jurisdiction  does  not exist in any such
federal court, then in any New Jersey state court located  in Essex County),
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled  at  law or in
equity.

IRC, lineal descendants  or a spouse of the undersigned, or to a trust or
other entity for the benefit  of  one or more of the foregoing persons,

Agreement;

 

 

(f) Represents  that the undersigned has the capacity to enter into this

Directors or as an  officer of Yardville or any of its subsidiaries.

 

 

(k) Agrees  that this Letter Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed  by  the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to any

indirect ownership  or  incidence of ownership of or with respect to any
shares of common stock of  Yardville.

 

 

The  obligations set forth herein shall terminate concurrently with the

**AFFILIATES  AGREEMENT**

 

 



 

______________,  2007

 



 



 



 



 



 

Gentlemen:

 



 

I  have  been advised that as of the date hereof I might be considered to be
an "affiliate" of Yardville National Bancorp, a New Jersey corporation 
("Yardville"), for purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the Securities Act of
1933,  as amended (the "Securities Act").

 

 

______________  ("Acquirer") and Yardville have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger,  dated as of _____________________, 2007 (the "Agreement").
Upon  consummation of the merger contemplated by the Agreement (the
"Merger"), I may  receive shares of common stock of Acquirer ("Acquirer
Common Stock") (i) in  exchange for my shares of common stock, no par value
per share, of Yardville  ("Yardville Common Stock") or (ii) as a result of
the exercise of Rights (as  defined in the Agreement). This agreement is
hereinafter referred to  as the "Letter Agreement."

 

 

I  represent and warrant to, and agree with, Acquirer as follows:

 

 

1. I  have read this Letter Agreement and the Agreement and have discussed their  requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell, pledge,  transfer or otherwise dispose of shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be received  by me pursuant to the Merger, to the extent I felt necessary, with my counsel  or  counsel for Yardville.

 

 

2. I  have been advised that any issuance of shares of Acquirer Common Stock to  me  pursuant to the Merger will be registered with the SEC. I have also  been advised, however, that, because I may be an "affiliate" of Yardville at the  time the Merger will be submitted for a vote of the stockholders of Yardville  and my disposition of such shares has not been registered under the Securities  Act, I must hold such shares indefinitely unless (i) such disposition of  such  shares is subject to an effective registration statement and to the availability  of a prospectus under the Securities Act, (ii) a sale of such shares is made  in  conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, (iii)  a  sale of such shares is made following expiration of the restrictive period  set  forth in Rule 145(d)(2) or (iv) in an opinion of counsel, in form and substance  reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer, I am advised that some other exemption  from  registration is available with respect to any such proposed disposition of  such  shares. I understand that Acquirer will be under no obligation to  register any disposition of my shares.

 

 

3. I  understand and agree that stop transfer instructions will be given to the  transfer agent of Acquirer with respect to the shares of Acquirer Common  Stock I  receive pursuant to the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificate  representing such shares, or any certificates delivered in substitution  therefor, a legend stating in substance:

 

 

The  shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which  Rule 145 under the Securities Act applies. The shares represented by 
this certificate may only be transferred in accordance with Rule 145(d) or 
an  effective registration statement or exemption from registration under
the  Securities Act.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B  -  1  

 

 

 

 

 

4. Unless  a transfer of my shares of the Acquirer Common Stock is a sale made in  conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), made following expiration  of the  restrictive period set forth in Rule 145(d) or made pursuant to any effective  registration statement under the Securities Act, Acquirer reserves the right  to  put an appropriate legend on the certificate issued to my  transferee.

 

 

It  is  understood and agreed that this Letter Agreement shall terminate and
be of  no  further force and effect if the Agreement is terminated in
accordance with  its  terms. It is also understood and agreed that this
Letter Agreement  shall terminate and be of no further force and effect and
the stop transfer  instructions set forth above shall be lifted forthwith
upon the delivery  by the  undersigned to Acquirer of a copy of a letter
from the staff of the SEC,  an  opinion of counsel in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer,  or  other evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Acquirer, to the effect that a  transfer of my shares of
Acquirer Common Stock will not violate the Securities  Act or any of the
rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder. In  addition, it is understood
and agreed that the legend set forth in Paragraph  3  above shall be removed
forthwith from the certificate or certificates  representing my shares of
~~~~ Acquirer Common Stock upon  expiration of the restrictive period set
forth in Rule 145(d)(2), so long  as  Acquirer is then in compliance with
SEC Rule 144(c), or if Acquirer shall  have  received a copy of a letter
from the staff of the SEC, an opinion of counsel  in  form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Acquirer, or other evidence  satisfactory to
Acquirer that a transfer of my shares of the Acquirer Common  Stock
represented by such certificate or certificates will be a sale made  in 
conformity with the provisions of Rule 145(d), or made pursuant to an
effective  registration statement under the Securities Act.

 

 

5. By  its acceptance hereof, Acquirer agrees, for a period of two years after the  Effective Time that it, as the Surviving Corporation, will (i) file on a  timely  basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of the  Exchange Act, so that the public information provisions of Rule 144(c) under  the  Securities Act are satisfied and the resale provisions of Rules 145(d)(1)  and  (2) under the Securities Act are therefore available to the undersigned in  the  event the undersigned desires to transfer any Acquirer Common Stock issued  to  the undersigned in the Merger, and (ii) otherwise cooperate to the extent  reasonably necessary in order that I may legally transfer or sell my shares  of  Acquirer Common Stock in accordance with the resale provisions of Rules  145(d)(1) and (2) under the Securities Act.

 

 

6. I  recognize and agree that the foregoing provisions also apply to (i) my spouse,  (ii) any relative of mine or my spouse's occupying my home, (iii) any trust or  estate in which I, my spouse or any such relative owns at least 10% beneficial  interest or of which any of us serves as trustee, executor or in any similar  capacity and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which I, my spouse  or  any such relative owns at least 10% of any class of equity securities or  of the  equity interest.

 

 

7. I  further recognize that in the event I become a director or officer of Acquirer  upon consummation of the Merger, any sale of Acquirer Common Stock by me  may  subject me to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange  Act  of 1934, as amended.

 

 

8 Execution  of this Letter Agreement should not be construed as an admission
on my part  that  I am an "affiliate" of Yardville as described in the first
paragraph of this  Letter Agreement or as a waiver of any rights I may have
to object to any  claim  that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of
this Letter  Agreement.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

B  -  2  

 

 

 

   



 

This  Letter Agreement shall be binding on my heirs, legal representative
and  successors.
