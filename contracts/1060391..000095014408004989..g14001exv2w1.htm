exchanging for the Merger  Consideration (i) certificates representing,
immediately  prior to the Effective Time, outstanding shares of Allied

Exchange Agent, when and as  needed, cash in amounts that are sufficient to
pay cash in lieu  of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.07_ and  any
dividends or other distributions pursuant to  _Section 2.05(f)_, in each
case, to be paid in respect  of the Certificates and the Uncertificated
Shares. Promptly (but  in any event within five (5) Business Days) after

to send, to each holder of shares of Allied Common Stock  at the Effective
Time a letter of transmittal and instructions  (which shall specify that the

proper delivery of  the Certificates (or the documentation required by 
_Section 2.09_) or transfer of the Uncertificated  Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange. 

  



  

  (b) Each holder of shares of Allied Common Stock shall be  entitled to
receive, upon (i) surrender to the Exchange  Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed  letter of transmittal (or the documentation
required by  _Section 2.09_), or (ii) receipt of an  "agents message" by
the Exchange Agent (or such  other evidence, if any, of transfer as the

of  Uncertificated Shares, the aggregate Merger Consideration that  such
holder has a right to receive pursuant to  _Section 2.04_ and any dividends
or other  distributions payable to such holder pursuant to  _Section
2.05(f)._ The shares of Republic  Common Stock constituting part of such
Merger Consideration, at  Republics option, shall be in uncertificated book-
entry  form, unless a physical certificate is requested by a holder of 
shares of Allied Common Stock or it otherwise required under  applicable Law.
As a result of the Merger, at the Effective  Time, all shares of Allied
Common Stock shall cease to be  outstanding and each holder thereof shall
cease to have any  rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the  Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof and any  dividends or

such payment that  (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed
or  shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such  Uncertificated
Share shall be properly transferred and  (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the  Exchange Agent any Stock Transfer Tax or other
Taxes required as  a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered  holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish

not payable. 

  



  

  (d) At the Effective Time, there shall be no further  registration of
transfers of shares of Allied Common Stock that  were outstanding prior to
the Merger. If, after the Effective  Time, Certificates or Uncertificated
Shares are 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  presented to Republic, they shall be canceled and exchanged as  provided
for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth,  in this _Article
II_. 

  



  

  (e) Any portion of the Merger Consideration made available  to the
Exchange Agent pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_  that remains unclaimed by the
holders of shares of Allied Common  Stock twelve (12) months after the
Effective Time shall be  returned to Republic, upon demand, and any such
holder who has  not exchanged Certificates or Uncertificated Shares, as the
case  may be, for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this  _Section
2.05_ prior to that time shall thereafter  look only to Republic for payment
of the Merger Consideration,  and any dividends and distribution with respect
thereto, in  respect of such shares without any interest thereon. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Republic shall not be liable to  any holder of
shares of Allied Common Stock for any amounts  properly paid to a public
official pursuant to applicable  abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.
Any amounts  remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Allied Common
Stock  six years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date, 
immediately prior to such time when the amounts would otherwise  escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity) shall  become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property  of Republic, free and clear of any
claims or interest of any  Person previously entitled thereto. 

  



  

  (f) No dividends or other distributions with respect to  Republic Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective  Time, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares as  provided in _Section 2.07_, shall be paid to
the  holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or any Uncertificated  Share
not transferred, until such Certificates or Uncertificated  Shares are
surrendered or transferred, as the case may be, as  provided in this Section.
Following such surrender or transfer,  there shall be paid, without interest,
to the Person in whose  name the securities of Republic have been
registered,  (i) at the time of such surrender or transfer, the amount  of
any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares to which such  Person is
entitled pursuant to _Section 2.07_ and the  amount of all dividends or other
distributions, payable with  respect to that number of whole shares of
Republic Common Stock  to which such Person is entitled pursuant to 
_Section 2.04_, with a record date after the Effective  Time and previously
paid or payable on the date of such  surrender with respect to such
securities, and (ii) at the  appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other  distributions, payable with respect to that number of
whole  shares of Republic Common Stock to which such Person is entitled 
pursuant to _Section 2.04_, with a record date after  the Effective Time and
prior to surrender or transfer and with a  payment date subsequent to
surrender or transfer payable with  respect to such securities.

number of whole  shares of Republic Common Stock equal to the number of
shares of  Allied Common Stock subject to such Allied Stock Option 
multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded to the nearest whole  share), at a
price per share of Republic Common Stock equal to  (i) the exercise price per
share of Allied Common Stock  otherwise purchasable pursuant to such Allied
Stock Option  divided by (ii) the Exchange Ratio, rounded to the nearest 
whole cent; _provided_ that the option price, the number of  shares
purchasable pursuant to each such so adjusted option and  the terms and
conditions of exercise of each such so adjusted  option shall be determined
in order to comply with  Section 409A of the Code and for any Allied Stock
Option to  which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its 
qualification under any of Sections 422 through 424 of the  Code, the option
price, the number of shares purchasable  pursuant to each such so adjusted
option and the terms and  conditions of exercise of each such so adjusted
option shall be  determined in order to comply with Section 424 of the
Code.  Other than as provided in this _Section 2.06_, the  terms of the
Allied Stock Options shall remain subject to any  existing conditions or
limitations, with Republic assuming the  obligations and succeeding to the
rights of Allied with respect  to such Allied Stock Options. 

  



  

  (b) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section 2.07_, at the Effective
Time, each Allied  Restricted Share, Allied RSU or Allied DSU that is
outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the  "
_Allied Stock Awards_ ") shall by virtue of the  Merger be converted into a
restricted share, restricted stock  unit or deferred restricted 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  stock unit, respectively, on the same terms and conditions  (including
applicable vesting requirements and deferral  provisions, but taking into
account any acceleration of Allied  Equity Awards pursuant to any Allied
Stock Plan or applicable  award agreement, employment agreement or other
similar agreement  governing the terms of such award) as applied to each
such  Allied Stock Award immediately prior to the Effective Time, with 
respect to the number of shares of Republic Common Stock that is  equal to
the number of shares of Allied Common Stock subject to  such Allied Stock
Award multiplied by the Exchange Ratio  (rounded to the nearest whole share).
Republic shall assume the  obligations and succeed to the rights of Allied
with respect to  such Allied Stock Awards. 

  



  

  (c) Prior to the Effective Time, Allied shall (i) use  all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any consents from  holders of Allied Equity
Awards granted under Allieds  equity or compensation plans or other
arrangements and  (ii) make any amendments to the terms of such equity or 
compensation plans or other arrangements that are necessary to  give effect
to the adjustments contemplated by this  _Section 2.06._ 

  



  

  (d) Prior to the Effective Time, Republic shall take such  actions as are
necessary for the assumption of Allied Equity  Awards pursuant to this
_Section 2.06_, including the  reservation, issuance and listing of Republic
Common Stock as is  necessary to effectuate the transactions contemplated by
this  _Section 2.06._ As soon as practicable  after the Effective Time,
Republic shall prepare and file with  the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form, or a  post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously  filed under the 1933 Act, with respect to the shares of 
Republic Common Stock subject to the Allied Equity Awards and,  where
applicable, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts  to have such
registration statement declared effective as soon  as practicable following
the Effective Time and to maintain the  effectiveness of such registration
statement covering such  Allied Equity Awards (and to maintain the current
status of the  prospectus contained therein) for so long as such Allied
Equity  Awards remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals, if 
any, who subsequent to the Effective Time, will be subject to  the reporting
requirements under Section 16(a) of the  1934 Act where applicable, Republic
shall use all  commercially reasonable efforts to administer Allied Equity 
Awards assumed by Republic pursuant to this  _Section 2.06_ in a manner that
complies with  Rule 16b-3  promulgated under the 1934 Act to the extent such
Allied  Equity Awards complied with such rule prior to the Merger. 

  



  

  Section 2.07 _Fractional  Shares_. No certificates, scrip or shares of 
Republic Common Stock representing fractional shares of Republic  Common
Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued  upon the surrender
for exchange of Certificates or  Uncertificated Shares, and such fractional
share interests shall  not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any
rights as a  stockholder of Republic by virtue of such fractional share 
interests. All fractional shares of Republic Common Stock that a  holder of
shares of Allied Common Stock would otherwise be  entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger shall be  aggregated and if a fractional share results
from such  aggregation, such holder shall be entitled to receive, in lieu 
thereof, an amount in cash without interest determined by  multiplying the
closing sale price of a share of Republic Common  Stock on the NYSE on the
first trading day immediately following  the Effective Time by the fraction
of a share of Republic Common  Stock to which such holder would otherwise
have been entitled.  Republic shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the
funds  required to make the cash payments required by this  _Section 2.07_
when and as needed. 

  



  

  Section 2.08 _Withholding  Rights_. Republic and the Surviving
Corporation  shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration  otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this  _Article
II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct  and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under  any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax law. If  Republic or the Surviving Corporation so withholds
amounts, such  amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as  having been paid to the Person in respect of which Republic or  the
Surviving Corporation made such deduction and withholding. 

  



  

  Section 2.09 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed  Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been  lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit
of  that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or
destroyed and if required by Republic, delivery by  such Person of an
agreement in form reasonably satisfactory to  Republic or, as Republic may
reasonably deem necessary, the  posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as  Republic may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be  made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange 
Agent will issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed 
Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of  the shares of
Allied Common Stock formerly represented by such  Certificate, as
contemplated by this _Article II_ and  any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to  _Section 2.05(f)._ 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. If  at any time during the period between the
date of this Agreement  and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of  capital stock of Republic or Allied shall occur by reason of any 
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, reverse split,  subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares,  or any stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such  period, the Exchange Ratio and any
amounts payable pursuant to  _Section 2.05(f)_ or _Section 2.07_ of this 
Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

letter from the IRS as to its  qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code
and the  tax-exempt status of any trust which forms a part of such plan

Material  Adverse Effect on Allied, and (ii) neither Allied nor any  Allied
Subsidiary has received written notice to the effect that  any individual or
Governmental Entity claimed or alleged that  Allied or any Allied Subsidiary

matters for which Allied or any  Allied Subsidiary has received written
notice from a  Governmental Entity, which notice asserts a lack of
compliance  with a particular Permit, but permits Allied or a Allied 
Subsidiary to cure such non-compliance within a reasonable  period of time
following the issuance of such notice and which  cure is being undertaken by
Allied or an Allied Subsidiary. The  consummation of the Merger, in and of
itself, will not cause the  revocation or cancellation of any Permit held by
Allied or an  Allied Subsidiary, except for such revocations or
cancellations  that, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Allied. 

  



  

  (c) Allied and each of its officers and directors (with  respect to his or

regulations of the  NYSE. Allied has previously disclosed to Republic any of
the  information required to be disclosed by Allied and certain of  its
officers to the Allied Board or any committee thereof  pursuant to the

  (d) Allied has established and maintains disclosure  controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in  Rule 13a-15(e)  or 15d-15(e)  under

consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known  to Allieds principal executive
officer and principal  financial officer by others within Allied and Allied 
Subsidiaries, particularly during the periods in which the  periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being  prepared; and such disclosure

executive  officer and principal financial officer to material information 
required to be included in Allieds periodic reports  required under the
Exchange Act. 

  



  

  (e) Allied has disclosed, based on its most recent  evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to Allieds auditors  and the audit committee of the Allied
Board, (i) any  significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design  or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which 
are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material  respect Allieds
ability to record, process, summarize and  report financial information and
(ii) any fraud, whether or  not material, that involves management or other
employees who  have a significant role in Allieds internal controls over 
financial reporting.

letter from the IRS as to its  qualification under Section 401(a) of the Code
and the  tax-exempt status of any trust which forms a part of such plan

adversely the  tax-qualified status of such Republic Plan or the tax-exempt 
status of any trust which forms a part thereof.

the Republic Subsidiaries has an obligation  to contribute or with respect to

except as may be required under  Part 6 of the Subtitle B of Title I of 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  ERISA and at the expense of the participant or the  participants
beneficiary or as may be required by  applicable state continuation coverage
Law.

the  Knowledge of Republic, threatened that, individually or in the 
aggregate, has had or would reasonably be expected to have a  Material
Adverse Effect on Republic. There is no picketing  pending or, to the
Knowledge of Republic, threatened, and there  are no strikes, slowdowns, work
stoppages, other job actions,  lockouts, arbitrations, grievances or other
labor disputes  involving any of the employees of Republic or any of the 
Republic Subsidiaries pending or, to the Knowledge of Republic,  threatened
that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or  would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect  on Republic. There are no
complaints, charges or claims against  Republic or any of the Republic
Subsidiaries pending or, to the  Knowledge of Republic, threatened that could
be brought or filed  with any Governmental Entity or arbitrator based on,
arising out  of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the
employment  Laws or to the employment or termination of employment or 
failure to employ by Republic or any of the Republic  Subsidiaries, of any
individual that, individually or in the  aggregate, have had or would

state or local Laws) with respect to  Republic or any of the Republic
Subsidiaries.

continuing Orders to which Republic or any Republic  Subsidiary is a party or
by which any of their respective  properties or assets are bound, and (b) no

Republic Subsidiary has received written notice to the  effect that any
individual or Governmental Entity claimed or  alleged that Republic or any
Republic Subsidiary was not in  compliance in all 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  material respects with all Laws applicable to Republic or any  Republic
Subsidiary, any of their respective properties or other  assets or any of

occupancy  and operation of its assets and properties, and  (ii) Republic
and each Republic Subsidiary is in compliance  with the terms of such
Permits, except for such matters for  which Republic or any Republic
Subsidiary has received written  notice from a Governmental Entity, which
notice asserts a lack  of compliance with a particular Permit, but permits
Republic or  a Republic Subsidiary to cure such non-compliance within a 
reasonable period of time following the issuance of such notice  and which
cure is being undertaken by Republic or a Republic  Subsidiary. The
consummation of the Merger, in and of itself,  will not cause the revocation
or cancellation of any Permit held  by Republic or a Republic Subsidiary,
except for such  revocations or cancellations that, individually or in the 
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse
Effect on Republic.

  (d) Republic has established and maintains disclosure  controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in  Rule 13a-15(e)  or 15d-15(e)  under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures  are designed to
ensure that material information relating to  Republic, including its
consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known  to Republics principal executive
officer and principal  financial officer by others within Republic and
Republic  Subsidiaries, particularly during the periods in which the 
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being  prepared; and
such disclosure controls and procedures are  effective in timely alerting
Republics principal executive  officer and principal financial officer to
material information  required to be included in Republics periodic
reports  required under the Exchange Act. 

  



  

  (e) Republic has disclosed, based on its most recent  evaluation prior to
the date hereof, to the Republics  auditors and the audit committee of the
Republic Board,  (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in  the design or operation of internal controls over financial  reporting
which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any  material respect
Republics ability to record, process,  summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any  fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or  other employees who have a significant role in Republics 
internal controls over financial reporting. 

  



  

  (f) As of the date hereof, Republic has not identified any  material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal  controls over
financial reporting. To the Knowledge of Republic,  Republics auditors and

Subsidiary is a party as of the date of  this Agreement. 

  



  

  (b) Neither Republic nor any of the Republic Subsidiaries  is in violation
of or in default under any Material Republic  Contract to which it is a party
or by which it or any of its  properties or assets is bound, except for

or would  not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on 
Republic. Except for such conditions that, individually or in  the aggregate,
have not had or would not reasonably be expected  to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Republic, no condition  exists or event has 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  occurred which (whether with or without notice or lapse of time  or both)
would constitute a default by Republic or a Republic  Subsidiary or, to the
Knowledge of Republic, any other party  thereto under any Material Republic
Contract or result in a  right of termination of any Material Republic
Contract. 

  



  

  (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to be  material to Republic
and the Republic Subsidiaries, taken as a  whole, neither Republic nor any
Republic Subsidiary or any  Affiliate of Republic, nor any of their

Republic  Contract, other than the Republic Credit Facility, which  (i)
restricts or prohibits Republic, any Republic  Subsidiary or any Affiliate of
Republic from, directly or  indirectly, engaging in any business involving

recycling,  marketing or disposal of rubbish, garbage, paper, textile
wastes  or chemical, liquid or any other wastes, or (ii) restricts  or
prohibits Republic, any Republic Subsidiary or any Affiliate  of Republic
from engaging in any other line of business or  competing in any geographic

Republic nor any  Republic Subsidiary is subject to any Material Republic
Contract  which contains a "most favored nation" provision to  provide the
other party to such Material Republic Contract  pricing or other terms at
least as favorable as those received  by other third parties who have
contracted with an Affiliate of  such entity.

not  reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the  aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Republic:  (a) Republic and the Republic
Subsidiaries own, license or  have the right to use all Intellectual Property
used in the  operation of their businesses as currently conducted, free and

  Section 6.02 _No Solicitation_. 

  



  

  (a) Each of Republic and Allied agrees that it shall not,  and it shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, and that it shall  direct and cause its and
its Subsidiaries respective  officers, directors and employees, agents and
representatives  (including any investment banker, attorney, accountant or
other  advisor retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries)  (collectively, "
_Representatives_ ") not to,  directly or indirectly, initiate, solicit or
otherwise knowingly  encourage or facilitate any inquiries or the making by
any third  Person or group (as defined in the Exchange Act) of third 
Persons (other than the other party hereto  and/or its  Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives) (a  " _Third Party_ ") of any proposal or
offer with  respect to a purchase, merger, reorganization, share exchange, 
consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement, business combination,  liquidation,
dissolution, recapitalization or similar  transaction involving 20% or more
of its consolidated total  revenues or assets (including by means of a
transaction with  respect to securities of such party or its Subsidiaries) or
20%  or more of its outstanding shares of common stock (any such  proposal
or offer being hereinafter referred to as an  " _Acquisition Proposal_ ", it
being understood  that none of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or  set forth in _Section 6.01(a)_ of the Allied  Disclosure
Schedule or _Section 6.01(b)_ of the  Republic Disclosure Schedule, as
applicable, shall be deemed to  constitute an Acquisition Proposal). Each of
Republic and Allied  further agrees that it shall not, and it shall cause
each of its  Subsidiaries not to, and it shall direct and cause its and its 
Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly or  indirectly, except as
permitted by _Section 6.02(b)_,  (i) engage in any negotiations or

principle,  option agreement, merger agreement, acquisition agreement or 
other agreement (whether binding or not) in furtherance of an  Acquisition
Proposal. 

  



  

  (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of  _Section 6.02(a)_, nothing
contained in this Agreement  shall prevent Republic or Allied, or their
respective Boards of  Directors, from (A) complying with  Rule 14d-9  or 
Rule 14e-2  promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to an
Acquisition  Proposal (provided, however, no Change in Recommendation may
be  made unless otherwise permitted by this  _Section 6.02(b)_), (B)
providing information in  response to a request therefor by a Third Party who
has made an  unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal if the
Board  of Directors of Republic or Allied, as the case may be, receives 
from the Third Party so requesting such information an executed 
confidentiality agreement on terms no less favorable in the  aggregate to the
disclosing party than those contained in the  Confidentiality Agreement (but
which need not contain standstill  or non-solicitation of employee provisions
and does not contain  other terms that prevent Republic or Allied, as the
case may be,  from complying with its obligations under this  _Section
6.02_) and so long as any information  provided to such Third Party that has
not previously been  provided to the other party is provided to the other
party as  promptly as practicable thereafter, (C) engaging in any 
negotiations or discussions (including solicitation of a revised  Acquisition
Proposal) with any Third Party who has made an  unsolicited bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal,  (D) effecting a Change in Recommendation in respect of
an  Acquisition Proposal or (E) effecting a Change in  Recommendation other
than in respect of an Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ _,_ that
neither Republic  nor Allied shall take any of the foregoing actions
unless: 

  



  

  (i) in each such case referenced in _clause (B)_ or  _(C)_ above, (1) the
applicable Stockholder Approval  has not yet been obtained, (2) such party
shall not have  breached the provisions of this _Section 6.02_ and  (3) the
Board of Directors of the party determines in good  faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor of national  reputation and outside legal counsel)
that such Acquisition  Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead  to, a Superior Proposal; 

  



  

  (ii) in each case referenced in _clause (D)_ above,  prior to Republic or
Allied, as the case may be, effecting a  Change in Recommendation with
respect to an Acquisition  Proposal, (1) the applicable Stockholder Approval
shall not  have been obtained, (2) such party shall not have breached  the
provisions of this _Section 6.02_ , (3) the Board  of Directors of such party
shall have determined in good faith,  after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal  counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior  Proposal, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  (4) such party shall have notified the other party in  writing, at least
four (4) Business Days in advance of such  Change in Recommendation (it being
understood that any change in  financial terms or other material terms of the
relevant  Acquisition Proposal shall extend such period by an additional 
two (2) Business Days from the date of receipt of the  revised Acquisition
Proposal containing such changed terms) that  it is considering taking such
action, specifying the material  terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and the identity  of the person making such Superior Proposal and
delivering the  documents and information required to be delivered pursuant
to  _Section 6.02(c)_, and (5) during such four  (4) Business Day period (as
extended, if applicable), such  party shall have negotiated, and shall have
made its financial  and legal advisors available to negotiate, with the other
party  should the other party elect to propose adjustments in the terms  and
conditions of this Agreement such that, after giving effect  thereto, such
Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a  Superior Proposal and at the
end of such four (4) Business  Day period (as extended, if applicable) the
Board of Directors  of such party shall have determined, in good faith
after  consultation with its financial advisor of national reputation  and
outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal  remains a Superior
Proposal after giving effect to all the  adjustments which may be offered
pursuant to this _clause  (5)._ As used herein, " _Superior  Proposal_ "
means a bona fide written Acquisition  Proposal with respect to a party that
the Board of Directors of  such party concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its  financial advisor of national reputation and outside
legal  counsel, is (i) more favorable to the stockholders of the  party
receiving the proposal than the Merger, taking into  account all terms and
conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,  including any  break-up  fees,
expense reimbursement provisions, conditions to  consummation, long-term
strategic considerations and other  factors deemed relevant by such Board of
Directors, as the case  may be, and (ii) reasonably capable of being
completed on a  timely basis; _provided_ _that_ for purposes of this 
definition, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " shall have  the meaning set forth
above, except that "50%" shall  be substituted for "20%" in the definition 
thereof; or 

  



  

  (iii) in the case referenced in _clause (E)_ above,  (1) the applicable
Stockholder Approval shall not have been  obtained, and (2) the Board of
Directors of such party  shall have determined in good faith after
consultation with  outside legal counsel that failure to make the Change in 
Recommendation would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties,  (3) such
party shall have notified the other party in  writing, at least four (4)
Business Days in advance of such  Change in Recommendation that it is
considering taking such  action, specifying in reasonable detail the reasons
therefor and  (4) during such four (4) Business Day period, such  party
shall have negotiated and shall have made its financial  and legal advisors
available to negotiate with the other party  should the other party elect to
propose adjustments in terms and  conditions of this Agreement such that,
after giving effect  thereto, such party shall have determined in good faith
after  consultation with outside counsel to not effect a Change in 
Recommendation. 

  



  

  (c) Each of Republic and Allied shall notify Allied, in the  case of
Republic, and Republic, in the case of Allied, promptly  (but in any event
within 24 hours) if any inquiries,  proposals or offers are received by, any
such information is  requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations
are  sought to be initiated or continued with it or any of its 
Representatives with respect to a potential Acquisition  Proposal,
indicating, in connection with such notice, the name  of such person and the
material terms and conditions of any  proposals or offers and providing,
promptly (and in any event  within 24 hours after receipt thereof), a copy of
all  documentation setting forth the terms of any such proposal or  offer or
the nature of such inquiry, and thereafter shall keep  Allied, in the case of
Republic, and Republic, in the case of  Allied, informed, on a reasonably
current basis, of the status  and terms of any such proposals or offers and
the status of any  such discussions or negotiations (including by delivering
any  further documentation of the type referred to above). 

  



  

  (d) Each of Republic and Allied shall, and shall cause its  Subsidiaries
and its and their respective Representatives to,  cease immediately and cause
to be terminated any and all  existing activities, discussions or
negotiations, if any, with  any third Person conducted prior to the date
hereof with respect  to any Acquisition Proposal by such party or any
action(s) that  could reasonably be expected to lead to any Acquisition
Proposal  by such party, and shall promptly (and in any event within five 
(5) Business Days) request (if not requested and complied  with) that all
confidential information with respect thereto  furnished by or on behalf of
Allied or Republic be returned or  destroyed in accordance with the terms of
the applicable  confidentiality agreement with such party. 

  



  

  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained  herein, Republic
or Allied, as applicable, shall be permitted to  terminate, amend, modify,
waive or fail to enforce any provision  of any "standstill" or similar 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  obligation of any Person if its Board of Directors determines in  good
faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that  the failure to
take such action would violate its fiduciary  duties. 

  



  

  (f) If pursuant to _Section 6.02(b)_ either party  effects a Change in
Recommendation (the " _Changing  Party_ "), the other party shall have the
option (the  " _Stockholder Vote Option_ "), exercisable within  ten (10)
Business Days after such Change in Recommendation,  to cause the applicable
Board of Directors of the Changing Party  to submit this Agreement to its
stockholders for the purpose of  adopting this Agreement notwithstanding the
Change in  Recommendation. If the other party exercises the Stockholder 
Vote Option, it shall not be entitled to terminate this  Agreement pursuant
to _Section 9.01(c)(i)_ or  _Section 9.01(d)(i)_, as applicable. If the
other  party fails to exercise the Stockholder Vote Option, the  Changing
Party shall terminate this Agreement within ten  (10) Business Days of
expiration of the Stockholder Vote  Option pursuant to and in accordance
with  _Section 9.01(c)(iii)_ or  _Section 9.01(d)(iii)_, as applicable. 

  



  

  (g) Each of Republic and Allied agrees that any violations  of the
restrictions set forth in this _Section 6.02_  by any of its Representatives
is or any of its Subsidiaries  shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 6.02_  by such party.

statement/prospectus (together  with any amendments thereof or supplements
thereto, the  " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_ ") in order to  seek the

any of their respective  Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by  Allied or Republic which should be set forth in an amendment

Statement/Prospectus, so that either such  document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact  or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which 
they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers such  information
shall promptly notify the other party and an  appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information  shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required  by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of each
of Allied and  Republic. The parties shall notify each other promptly of

the staff of  the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy 
Statement/Prospectus, the  Form S-4  or the Merger and (y) copies of all

Subsidiaries to, afford to the other, and to the  others Representatives,

prohibit such access and  (ii) nothing herein shall require any party to
disclose  information to the extent such information would result in 
disclosure of trade secrets or a waiver of attorney-client  privilege, work
product doctrine or similar privilege or violate  any confidentiality
obligation of such party (provided that such  party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to permit such  disclosure to be made in a manner
consistent with the protection  of such privilege or to obtain any consent
required to permit  such disclosure to be made without violation of such 
confidentiality obligations, as applicable). The parties  acknowledge and
agree that nothing in this  _Section 7.03_ shall require either Allied or
Republic  to take or allow any action that would unreasonably interfere

_Burdensome  Condition_ " shall mean making proposals, executing or 
carrying out agreements (including consent decrees) or  submitting to Laws

or the Republic Subsidiaries (any matter referenced in  the foregoing clause
(i) or (ii) being a  " _Regulatory Divestiture_ ") that, in the case of  (i)
and (ii), individually or in the aggregate would  reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect after  the Effective Time on (x) the assets
and liabilities,  financial condition or business of Republic and Republic 
Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation and its  Subsidiaries),
taken as a whole, or (y) the benefits  expected to be derived by the parties
on the date of this  Agreement from the combination of Republic and Allied
via the  Merger (such combined business to be taken as a whole) in such a 
manner that such party would not have entered into this  Agreement in the
face of such materially and adversely affected  benefits. The parties agree
that no party shall enter into,  consent to or acquiesce to any Regulatory
Divestiture without  the prior written consent of the other parties.

  (b) Each of Republic, Merger Sub and Allied shall use its  reasonable best
efforts to obtain the opinions referred to in  _Sections 8.02(d)_ and

each present and former  director and officer of Allied or any of the Allied
Subsidiaries  and each person who served at the request of Allied or any 
Allied Subsidiary as a director or officer of another  corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other  employee benefit plan or
other enterprise (the  " _Indemnified Parties_ "), against any costs or 
expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel),  judgments,
fines, penalties, losses, claims, damages or  liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement (collectively,  " _Losses_ ") incurred in connection with any 
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,  criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or  pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the  Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this  Agreement) relating to the Indemnified
Partys service with  or at the request of Allied, whether asserted or
claimed prior  to, at or after the Effective Time to the fullest extent 
permitted by applicable Law; provided that such indemnification  shall be
subject to any limitation imposed from time to time  under applicable Laws.
Expenses (including attorneys fees)  incurred by any Indemnified Party in
defending any civil,  criminal, administrative or investigative action, suit
or  proceeding shall be paid by Republic and the Surviving  Corporation in
advance of the final disposition of such action,  suit or proceeding, subject
to receipt of an undertaking by or  on behalf of such Indemnified Party to
repay such amounts if it  shall ultimately be determined that such
Indemnified Party is  not entitled under applicable Law to be indemnified
under this  _Section 7.06(a)._ The indemnification  rights hereunder are not
exclusive and shall be in addition to  any other rights such Indemnified
Party may have under any Law  or Contract or any organizational documents of
any Person, under  the DGCL or otherwise. The certificate of incorporation of
the  Surviving Corporation and its by-laws shall contain, and the  Surviving
Corporation shall, and Republic shall cause it to,  fulfill and honor,
provisions with respect to indemnification,  advancement of expenses and
exculpation that are at least as  favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those set forth in the  Allied Charter and Allied By-laws as of the date of
this  Agreement, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise  modified for
a period of six (6) years from the Effective  Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights  thereunder of any of the Indemnified Parties.
The parties agree  that the provisions relating to exculpation of directors
and the  rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses incurred  in
defense of any action or suit in the Allied Charter or Allied  By-Laws and
the comparable organizational documents of the  Allied Subsidiaries with
respect to matters occurring through  the Effective Time shall survive the
Merger and shall continue  in full force and effect for a period of six (6)
years from  the Effective Time; _provided_ that all rights to 
indemnification and advancements in respect of any Proceeding  pending or
asserted or claim made within such period shall  continue until the
disposition of such Proceeding or resolution  of such claim. 

  



  

  (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective  Time, Republic and
the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in  effect the current policies of
directors and  officers liability insurance maintained by Allied 
(provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor  policies
with a substantially comparable insurer of at least the  same coverage and
amounts containing terms and conditions that  are no less advantageous to the
insured) with respect to claims  arising from facts or events which occurred
at or before the  Effective Time (including the transactions contemplated by
this  Agreement) provided that, in satisfying its obligation under  this
_Section 7.06(b)_, Republic or the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable,
shall not be obligated to pay annual  premium payments for such insurance to
the extent such premiums  exceed 300% of the annual premiums paid as of the
date hereof by  Allied for such insurance (the " _Current  Premium_ "). In
the event that, but for the proviso to  the immediately preceding sentence,
Republic or the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable, would be required to
expend more  than 300% of the Current Premium, Republic or the Surviving 
Corporation, as applicable, shall obtain the maximum amount of  insurance
obtainable having the terms and scope of coverage of  the relevant existing
Allied policy and covering facts, events,  acts and omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time by  payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of the
Current Premium. 

  



  

  (c) If Republic or the Surviving Corporation or any of its  successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into  any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving  corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or  (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its 
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such  case, to the
extent necessary, proper provision shall be made so  that the successors and
assigns of Republic or the Surviving  Corporation, as applicable, shall
assume the obligations set  forth in this _Section 7.06._ 

  



  

  (d) Republic and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the  fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, pay (as incurred)  all expenses (including
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel)  that an Indemnified Party may incur
in enforcing the indemnity  and other rights and obligations provided for in
this  _Section 7.06._ 

  



  

  (e) The provisions of this _Section 7.06_ are  (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be  enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and  their representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in 
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification,  advancement of
expenses or contribution that any such Person may  have by contract or
otherwise. No release executed by any  Indemnified Party in connection with
his or her departure from  Allied, Republic or any of the Allied Subsidiaries
or Republic  Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a release or waiver of any
of  the indemnity or other rights provided such Indemnified Party in  this
_Section 7.06_, unless the release or waiver of  the provisions of this
_Section 7.06_ is expressly  provided for in such release. 

  



  

  Section 7.07 _Public  Announcements_. Except for matters covered by 
_Section 6.02_, Republic, on the one hand, and Allied,  on the other hand,
shall consult with each other before issuing,  and provide each other the
opportunity to review and comment  upon, any press release or other public
statements with respect  to any transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including  the Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make 
any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as  may be
required by applicable Law, by fiduciary duties, by court  process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with  any national securities
exchange. 

  



  

  Section 7.08 _Stock Transfer  Taxes_. Except as provided in  _Section
2.05(c)_, all Stock Transfer Taxes, if any,  and any penalties or interest
with respect to any such Stock  Transfer Taxes shall be paid by Republic. 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  Section 7.09 _Employee Matters_. 

  



  

  (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Allied Plans and  the Republic
Plans, as in effect at the Effective Time, will  remain in effect (including
any terms, conditions and provisions  contained in such plans that may apply
after the Continuation  Dates set forth below), except as provided in 
_Section 2.06_, with respect to employees and former  employees of Allied or
Republic and their Subsidiaries, as  applicable, and the dependents of such
employees covered by such  plans at the Effective Time (the " _Covered 
Employees_ "), until at least December 31, 2008 or,  in the case of the
Allied Plans that are designated as Welfare  Plans on _Section 4.10_(a) of
the Allied Disclosure  Schedules, until at least March 31, 2009 (both such
dates  collectively referred to as the " _Continuation  Dates_ "). If, in
applying the foregoing, a Covered  Employee has the right to receive a grant
of Allied RSUs under  an Allied Plan after the Effective Time as a result of
a  deferral of a bonus made prior to the Effective Time, then such  right to
receive an Allied RSU shall be converted into a right  to receive a grant of
Republic RSUs, otherwise on the same terms  and conditions as applied to the
right to receive such Allied  RSU immediately prior to the conversion. Prior
to the Effective  Time, Allied and Republic acting in good faith will
cooperate in  reviewing, evaluating and analyzing the Allied Plans and the 
Republic Plans with a view towards developing appropriate  employee benefit
and compensation plans, programs and  arrangements for Covered Employees
after the Effective Time  which, among other things, (i) will treat
similarly  situated Covered Employees on a substantially equivalent basis, 
taking into account all relevant factors, including duties, 
responsibilities, geographic location, tenure, and  qualifications and (ii)
will not discriminate between  Covered Employees who at the Effective Time
are covered by  Allied Plans, on the one hand, and those covered by
Republic  Plans, on the other hand, and which Republic will adopt subject 
to customary rights to subsequently amend or terminate such  plans as
Republic thereafter deems appropriate (individually a  " _New Benefit Plan_ "
and collectively the  " _New Benefits Plans_ "). 

  



  

  (b) Each New Benefit Plan will (i) provide all of the  Covered Employees
eligible to participate in such plans with  service credit for purposes of
eligibility, participation,  vesting and levels of benefits (but not for
benefit accruals  under any defined benefit pension plan or any retiree
medical or  other post-retirement welfare plan or as would otherwise result 
in a duplication of benefits) for all periods of employment with  Allied or
Republic or any of their respective Subsidiaries (or  their predecessor
entities) prior to the Effective Time,  (ii) cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations,  eligibility, waiting periods or required physical
examinations  under any 

  



  

  New Benefit Plan which is a welfare plan to be waived with  respect to the
Covered Employees and their eligible dependents,  to the extent waived under
the corresponding plan in which the  applicable Covered Employees
participated immediately prior to  the Effective Time and, with respect to
life insurance coverage,  up to the Covered Employees current level of
insurability,  and (iii) give the Covered Employees and their eligible 
dependents credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time  (or the date
of commencement of participation in such New  Benefit Plan) occurs towards
applicable deductibles and annual  out-of-pocket limits for expenses incurred
prior to the  Effective Time (or the date of commencement of participation
in  such New Benefit Plan). 

  



  

  (c) At the Effective Time, Republic will assume the  employment agreements
and change in control agreements to which  Allied or any Allied Subsidiary is
a party, unless such  agreements are superseded by new arrangements pursuant
to an  agreement executed by Republic and the relevant employee.  Republic
shall offer to each individual with a title of senior  vice president or
higher of Allied the ability to enter into an  agreement in form and
substance agreed to by Republic and Allied  prior to the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (d) Republic shall amend Republics Employee Stock  Purchase Plan so that
Allied employees shall have the right to  make purchases under this plan
effective as soon as possible,  but in no event later than the first purchase
period after the  Effective Time. 

  



  

  (e) From and after the Effective Time, Republic will honor  all accrued
and vested benefit obligations to and contractual  rights of current and
former employees of Allied and Republic  and their respective Subsidiaries
under the Allied Plans or  Republic Plans, as applicable, to the extent
accrued and vested  as of the Effective Time. 

  



  

  (f) Nothing in this _Section 7.09_ shall be  treated as an amendment of
any Allied Plan or any Republic Plan  (or an undertaking to amend any such
plan), (ii) nothing in  this _Section 7.09_ will prohibit Republic from 
amending, modifying or terminating any Allied Plan or Republic  Plan pursuant
to, and in accordance with, the terms thereof, 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  and (iii) nothing in this _Section 7.09_ shall  confer any rights or
benefits on any person other than Allied  and Republic. 

  



  

  Section 7.10 _Section 16  Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Allied 
shall take all actions reasonably necessary to cause any  dispositions of
equity securities of Allied (including  derivative securities) in connection
with the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who
is a  director or officer of Allied to be exempt under  Rule 16b-3 
promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance with the  No-Action Letter
dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC  regarding such matters. Assuming
that Allied delivers to  Republic the Section 16 Information (as defined
below)  reasonably in advance of the Effective Time, the Republic Board,  or
a committee of Non-Employee Directors thereof (as such term  is defined for
purposes of  Rule 16b-3(d)  under the Exchange Act), shall reasonably
promptly thereafter  and in any event prior to the Effective Time adopt a
resolution  providing that the receipt by the Insiders (as defined below)
of  Republic Common Stock in exchange for shares of Allied Common  Stock and
the receipt of equity awards in respect of Republic  Common Stock as
contemplated by _Section 2.06_, in  each case pursuant to the transactions
contemplated hereby and  to the extent such securities are listed in the
Section 16  Information provided by Allied to Republic prior to the 
Effective Time, is intended to be exempt from liability pursuant  to Section
16(b) under the Exchange Act such that any such  receipt shall be so exempt.
" _Section 16  Information_" shall mean information accurate in all 
material respect regarding the Insiders, the number of shares of  the capital
stock held by each such Insider, and the number and  description of options,
stock appreciation rights, restricted  shares and other stock-based awards
held by each such Insider.  " _Insider_ " shall mean those officers and 
directors of Allied who are subject to the reporting  requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act and who  are listed in the Section 16
Information. 

  



  

  Section 7.11 _Financing_. 

  



  

  (a) Prior to the Effective Time, Allied, A-Sub and B-Sub  shall provide to
the trustees under the Indentures all such  notifications, certificates,
opinions and other information and  documents as may be required by the
Indentures or the trustees  under the Indentures in connection with the
Merger and the  payoff and termination of the Allied Credit Facility and
the  Allied Accounts Receivable Facility and, in each case, the  release of
collateral thereunder. 

  



  

  (b) Republic shall use its best efforts to take, or cause  to be taken,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to  arrange and consummate the
financing (the " _Debt  Financing_ ") necessary to provide immediately
available  funds sufficient to refinance (i) the Republic Credit  Facility
to the extent necessary or advisable,  (ii) Allieds $1.575 billion Revolving
Credit  Facility due March 2012, (iii) Allieds  $806.7 million Term Loan B
due March 2014, referred to as  the 2005 Term Loan, (iv) Allieds $485
million  Institutional Letter of Credit Facility due March 2014,  (v)
Allieds $25 million Incremental Revolving  Letter of Credit Facility due
March 2012 and  (vi) Allieds $400 million Account Receivable 
Securitization program (the " _Allied Accounts Receivable  Facility_ "),
including using reasonable best efforts to  (A) enter into definitive
agreements with respect thereto  on terms and conditions acceptable to Allied
(in its reasonable  discretion) and (B) consummate the Debt Financing on or 
prior to the Effective Time. Republic shall (x) furnish  correct and complete
copies of all such definitive agreements to  Allied promptly upon their
execution, and (y) keep Allied  informed on a reasonably current basis and in
reasonable detail  of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
and  shall give Allied prompt notice of any material adverse change  with
respect to such Debt Financing and (z) use its best  efforts to cause the
lenders and the other Persons providing  such Debt Financing to fund the Debt
Financing on the Closing  Date (including taking enforcement action to cause
such lenders  and other Persons to provide such Debt Financing). Prior to
the  Closing, Allied shall use its reasonable best efforts to  cooperate
with Republic in arranging, consummating and funding  the Debt Financing, and
if requested by Republic, the  refinancing of the Republic Credit Facility,
including making  Allieds officers available to the arrangers of the Debt 
Financing and such refinancing and potential lenders, and  providing such
information reasonably requested by the arrangers  of the Debt Financing and
such refinancing and potential lenders. 

  



  

  (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  Agreement, Republic
acknowledges and agrees that the  consummation of the Merger is not
conditional upon receipt by  Republic or any of its Affiliates of the
proceeds of the Debt  Financing. 

  



  

  (d) Each of Republic and Allied shall use its respective  best efforts to
not do, and to not cause or permit to be done,  anything that would
reasonably be expected to cause the  condition to closing set forth in
_Section 8.03(e)_ to  not be satisfied and shall use its respective best
efforts to  take any actions necessary (subject to the others consent  if 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  required pursuant to _Section 6.01(a)_ or  _Section 6.01(b),_ as
applicable) to ensure that the  condition to closing set forth in _Section
8.03(e)_ is  satisfied. 

  



  

  Section 7.12 _Stock Exchange  Listing_. Republic shall use its best
efforts to  cause the shares of Republic Common Stock to be issued in the 
Merger to be approved for listing on the NYSE, subject to  official notice of

  Section 7.13 _Notice of Certain  Events_. Each party shall promptly notify
the  other of: 

  



  

  (a) any material notice or other material communication  from any Person
alleging that the Consent of such Person is or  may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated  by this Agreement, which consent would be
material to Republic  and the Republic Subsidiaries taken as a whole after
giving  effect to the Merger; 

  



  

  (b) any material notice or other material communication  from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions  contemplated by this
Agreement; and

may be, that,  if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been 
required to have been disclosed pursuant to any of such  partys
representations or warranties, as the case may be,  or that relate to the
consummation of the transactions  contemplated by this Agreement; 

  



  

  provided that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this  _Section 7.13_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the  remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving that notice. 

  



  

  Section 7.14 _Certain Corporate Governance and  Other Matters_.

ability to acquire or vote shares is or may become  applicable to the Merger

 ##### 

  

  

  the Allied Board will grant such approvals and take such other  actions as
are necessary so that such transactions may be  consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated  hereby and otherwise act to eliminate

Proposal for Republic shall have  been publicly announced or made known to
the Republic Board and  within twelve (12) months following the termination
of this  Agreement, Republic enters into a binding agreement to effect an 
Acquisition Proposal, or an Acquisition Proposal with respect to  Republic is

  (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Allied pursuant to  _Section

  (iii) Republic acknowledges that the agreements contained  in this

attorneys fees) in connection with any action (including  the filing of any
lawsuit) taken to collect payment of such  amounts, together with interest on

  (ii) If this Agreement is terminated by Republic pursuant  to _Section

fees) in connection with any action (including  the filing of any lawsuit)
taken to collect payment of such  amounts, together with interest on such

meeting and  shall be given not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty  (60)
days before the day of the meeting. If mailed, such  notice shall be deemed
to be given when deposited in the United  States mail, postage prepaid,
directed to the stockholder at his  address as it appears on the records of

the purpose or  purposes for which the meeting is being called. Whenever
notice  is required to be given hereunder, a written waiver of notice 
signed by the stockholder entitled to notice, whether before or  after the
time stated in the notice, shall be deemed equivalent  to notice. Attendance
of a person at a meeting shall constitute  a waiver of notice of such meeting
except when a person attends  for the express purpose of objecting, at the
beginning of the  meeting, to the transaction or any business because the
meeting  is not lawfully called or convened. 

  



  

  Section 2.4 _Quorum and  Adjournment_. The presence, in person or by
proxy,  of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the  outstanding
shares of stock entitled to vote on every matter  that is to be voted on,
without regard to class or series, shall  constitute a quorum at all meetings
of the stockholders. In the  absence of a quorum, the holders of a majority
of the voting  power of such shares of stock present in person or by proxy
may  adjourn such meeting, from time to time, without notice other  than
announcement at the meeting (unless otherwise required by  law), until a
quorum shall attend. At any meeting reconvened  after such adjournment at
which a quorum may be present, any  business may be transacted which might
have been transacted at  the meeting as originally called, but only those
stockholders  entitled to vote at the meeting as originally called shall be 
entitled to vote at any reconvened meeting, unless a new record  date for
such meeting is fixed.

  Section 2.5 _Officers at Stockholders   Meetings_. The Chairman of the
Board of Directors  shall preside at all meetings of stockholders. In his

to vote at the meeting.

registered in the name of each stockholder, shall be  prepared by or for the
Secretary and shall be open to the  examination of any stockholder for any
purpose germane to the  meeting, during ordinary business hours, either at a
place  within the city where the meeting is to be held, which place  shall
be specified in the notice of the meeting, or if not so  specified, at the
place where the meeting is to be held. Such  list shall be available for
inspection at the meeting. 

  



  

  Section 2.7 _Fixing Date for Stockholders of  Record_. In order that the
Corporation may  identify the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote
at  any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or to  express
consent to corporate action in writing without a  meeting, or entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other  distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise  any rights in respect of any change,
conversion or exchange of  stock or for the purpose of any other lawful
action, the Board  of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which
shall not  be less than ten (10) days nor more than sixty  (60) days before
the date of such meeting, nor more than  sixty (60) days prior to any other
action. If no record  date is fixed, the record date for determining
stockholders  entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders 
shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the  day on which
notice of the meeting is given, or if notice is  waived, at the close of
business on the day next preceding the  day on which the meeting is held. The
record date for  determining stockholders entitled to express consent to 
corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior  action by the
Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day  on which the first written
consent is delivered to the  Corporation by delivery to its registered office
in the State of  Delaware, its principal place of business or any officer
or  agent of the Corporation having custody of the minute books of  the
Corporation. The record date for determining stockholders  for any other
purpose shall be at the close of business on the  day on which the Board of
Directors adopts the resolution  relating thereto. A determination of
stockholders of record  entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of
stockholders  shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting; provided, 
however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date  for the
adjourned meeting. 

  



  

  Section 2.8 _Voting and  Proxies_. Subject to the provisions for fixing
the  date for stockholders of record: 

  



  

  (a) Except as otherwise specified in the Amended and  Restated Certificate
of Incorporation (the " _Certificate  of Incorporation_ "), each stockholder
shall at every  meeting of the stockholders be entitled to one vote for
each  share of stock held by that stockholder having voting rights as  to
the matter being voted upon. 

  



  

  (b) Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of  stockholders or to
express consent or dissent to corporate  action in writing without a meeting
may authorize another person  or persons to act for that stockholder by
proxy, but no such  proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from
its  date, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period. 

  



  

  (c) Each matter properly presented to any meeting of  stockholders shall
be decided by the affirmative vote of the  holders of a majority of the
voting power of the shares of stock  present in person or by proxy and
entitled to vote on the matter. 

  



  

  Section 2.9 _Inspectors of  Election_. The Corporation shall, in advance
of  any meeting of stockholders, appoint one or more inspectors of 
election, who may be employees of the Corporation, to act at the  meeting or
any adjournment thereof and to make a written report  thereof. The
Corporation may designate one or more persons as  alternate inspectors to
replace any inspector who fails to act.  In the event that no inspector so
appointed or designated is  able to act at a meeting of stockholders, the
person presiding  at the meeting shall appoint one or more inspectors to act
at  the meeting. Each inspector, before entering upon the discharge  of his
or her duties, shall take and sign an oath to execute  faithfully the duties
of inspector with strict impartiality and  according to the best of his or
her ability. The inspector or  inspectors so appointed or designated shall
(i) ascertain  the number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation 
outstanding and the voting power of each such share,  (ii) determine the
shares of capital stock of the  Corporation represented at the meeting and
the validity of  proxies and ballots, (iii) count all 

  
 ##### 

  

  

  votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a  reasonable period a
record of the disposition of any challenges  made to any determination by the
inspectors, and  (v) certify their determination of the number of shares of 
capital stock of the Corporation represented at the meeting and  such
inspectors count of all votes and ballots. Such  certification and report
shall specify such other information as  may be required by law. In
determining the validity and counting  of proxies and ballots cast at any
meeting of stockholders of  the Corporation, the inspectors may consider such
information as  is permitted by applicable law. No person who is a candidate
for  an office at an election may serve as an inspector at such  election. 

  



  

  Section 2.10 _Conduct of  Meetings_. The date and time of the opening
and  the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the  stockholders
will vote at a meeting shall be announced at the  meeting by the person
presiding over the meeting. The Board of  Directors of the Corporation may
adopt by resolution such rules  and regulations for the conduct of the
meeting of stockholders  as it shall deem appropriate. Except to the extent
inconsistent  with such rules and regulations as adopted by the Board of 
Directors, the chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall  have the right
and authority to prescribe such rules,  regulations and procedures and to do
all such acts as, in the  judgment of such chairman, are appropriate for the
proper  conduct of the meeting. Such rules, regulations or procedures, 
whether adopted by the Board of Directors or prescribed by the  chairman of
the meeting, may include, without limitation, the  following: (i) the
establishment of an agenda or order of  business for the meeting; (ii) rules
and procedures for  maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of

and constituted proxies or  such other persons as the chairman of the meeting
shall  determine; (iv) restrictions on entry to the meeting after  the time
fixed for commencement thereof; and  (v) limitations on the time allotted to
questions or  comments by participants. Unless and to the extent determined
by  the Board of Directors or the chairman of the meeting, meetings  of
stockholders shall not be required to be held in accordance  with the rules
of parliamentary procedure. 

  



  

  Section 2.11 _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu  of Meeting_. Any action
that may be taken at any  annual or special meeting of stockholders may be
taken without a  meeting, without a prior notice and without a vote, if a
consent  in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is signed by the 
stockholders having not less than the minimum number of votes  that would be
necessary to authorize or take such action at a  meeting at which all shares
entitled to vote thereon were  present and voted. Prompt notice of the taking
of such action  without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent
shall  be given to each stockholder who did not consent thereto in 
writing.

the time of such meeting.  Notice of any meeting of the Board of Directors
need not be  given to any director if that director signs a written waiver 
thereof either before or after the time stated therein.  Attendance of a

or  of any committee thereof may participate in a meeting of the  Board of
Directors or of such committee by means of conference  telephone or similar
communications equipment by means of which  all persons participating in the

person at such  meeting. 

  



  

  Section 3.10 _Compensation_. Directors  shall receive such compensation
and expense reimbursements for  their services as directors or as members of
committees as set  by the Board of Directors. Nothing herein contained shall
