otherwise in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all documents
reasonably required by the Paying Agent to evidence and effect such transfer

proxy statement and other documents filed by the Company with the SEC since
December 31, 2000 (as such documents have since the time of their filing been
amended, the "Company SEC Reports"), as of its respective date, did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading and complied in all material respects with all applicable
requirements of the appropriate act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

regulations of the New York Stock Exchange since the initial public
offering of the Company Common Shares. At no time has the Company
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary been subject to the reporting
requirements of Sections 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. Each form, report
and document containing financial statements that has been filed with or
submitted to the SEC since July 31, 2002 and that was required under the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") to be accompanied by
the officer certifications required under such Act was accompanied by the
certification required to be filed or submitted by the Companys chief

interest in, any Company Subsidiary except as contemplated by this Agreement,

such disclosed claims, suits, actions, proceedings, investigations or
reviews, that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse

"Fee-Owned and Ground Leased Property," identifies all real property owned
(the "Fee-Owned Properties") or ground leased (the "Ground Leased
Properties") by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the entity that

The Company or the Company Subsidiary set forth on Schedule 3.9 to the
Company Disclosure Schedule owns fee simple title to their respective Fee-
Owned Properties or has leasehold title to their respective Ground Leased
Properties. All such Fee-Owned Properties are owned in each case free and
clear of liens, mortgages or deeds of trust, claims against title, charges
which are liens, security interests or other encumbrances on title securing
monetary obligations ("Encumbrances") (except as provided below).  All such
Ground Leased Properties are leased in each case free and clear of
Encumbrances (except as provided below).  No other Person has any ownership
interest in any of the Company Properties or any option to purchase any of
the Company Properties. The Company Properties are not subject to any rights
of way, written agreements or Laws affecting building use or occupancy, or
reservations of an interest in title (collectively, "Property Restrictions")
or other Encumbrances, except for (i) Encumbrances and Property Restrictions
set forth in Schedule 3.9 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) Property
Restrictions imposed or promulgated by Law with respect to real property,
including, zoning regulations, (iii) Encumbrances and Property Restrictions

disclosed in Schedule 3.9 to the Company Disclosure Schedule or contained in
the previously delivered title reports and surveys, in any event, do not
materially interfere with the

  

### 

  

### 15      
   

### 

  

### present use of, any of the Company Properties subject thereto or affected
thereby (provided that the Company specifically represents and warrants that

to the Company Disclosure Schedule, has been released of record since the
date of the title report in question), (iv) Property Restrictions relating to
the provision of telecommunications or similar communications services, (v)
real estate taxes and assessments which constitute a Lien but are not yet due
and payable and (vi) mechanics, carriers, workmens, repairmens liens
or other Encumbrances and Property Restrictions, if any, which, individually
or in the aggregate, do not materially detract from the value of or
materially interfere with the present use of any of the Company Properties
subject thereto or affected thereby. No portion of any of the Company
Properties is located in a flood zone area. Copies of each ground lease with
respect to the Ground Leased Properties have been delivered to Acquiror and
are true, correct and complete copies thereof.  Each ground lease with
respect to the Ground Lease Properties is in full force and effect and the
Company is not in default under any such ground lease and, to the Companys
Knowledge, no other party is in default under any such ground lease.

  

### 

  

### (b) Valid policies of title insurance (each, a "Company Title Insurance
Policy") have been issued insuring the Companys or the applicable Company
Subsidiarys fee simple or leasehold title to the Company Properties, subject
only to the matters disclosed above and on the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and such policies are to the Companys Knowledge, at the date hereof, in full
force and effect and no outstanding claim with respect to any such policy
exists. A true and correct copy of each Company Title Insurance Policy has
been previously made available to Acquiror.

  

### 

  

### (c) Except as provided in the Companys capital budget for 2004, dated
October 28, 2003 and previously delivered to Acquiror (the "2004 Company
Capital Budget"), the Company has no Knowledge (i) that any certificate,
permit or license from any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over
any of the Company Properties or any agreement, easement or other right which
is necessary to permit the lawful use and operation of the buildings and
improvements on any of the Company Properties or which is necessary to permit
the lawful current use and operation of all driveways, roads and other means

violation of any Law materially and adversely affecting any of the Company
Properties issued by any Governmental Authority.

  

### 

  

### (d) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has received
any written notice to the effect that (i) any condemnation or rezoning
proceedings are pending or threatened with respect to any of the Company
Properties or (ii) any zoning, building or similar Law is or will be violated
in any material respect for any property by the continued maintenance,
operation or use of any buildings or other improvements on any of the Company
Properties in accordance with current practice or by the continued
maintenance, operation or use of the parking areas to the extent such
violation has not been cured.

  

### 

  

### (e) All of the Company Properties are managed by the Company or a wholly-
owned Company Subsidiary.

### 16      
   

### 

  

### (f) Schedule 3.9 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, under the caption
"Leased Properties," identifies all space leases for space leased by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary (the "Leased Properties").  The Company is
not in default under the leases for such Leased Property and, to the
Companys Knowledge, no circumstance exists that with the passage of time
would result in the default of the Company under the leases for any of the
Leased Properties. The Company has provided Acquiror with true, correct and
complete copies of the leases for the Leased Properties. The
Company Partnership is the tenant under the leases for such Leased Properties
and the Company Partnership occupies the Leased Properties and has neither
assigned the leases for the Leased Properties nor subleased any portion of
the Leased Properties.

  

### 

  

### (g) The rent roll and related information with respect to the Company
Properties as of November 30, 2003 has been previously delivered to Acquiror,
and is complete and correct in all material respects as of the date thereof

respect to the Company Properties as of such date, reflecting the suite
number or other appropriate designation of the space occupied and the number
of square feet of rentable area, the name of the tenant, the term of the
lease, the monthly rental, the escalations or pass-through (including an
enumeration of expenses of any Company Property to be paid by the tenant,
identifying the base year for calculation of escalations and the amount of
base year expenses agreed upon by the landlord and tenant and the amount of
the latest billings to the tenant with respect to all escalations), whether
such rent includes utilities or other services and the amount of the security
or other deposit collected and/or applied. The Company Rent Roll is a complete
and accurate description of the leases with respect to the Company Properties
as described above. The Company has made available to Acquiror true, correct

correct and complete description of the amount of any outstanding and unused
tenant improvements with respect to the Company Properties.

  

### 

  

### (h) All tenants of the Company Properties have accepted and, to the
Companys Knowledge, are occupying the respective leased premises. All leases
with respect to the Company Properties are in full force and effect and
neither the landlord, nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any tenant, is in
default under any such lease. Except as contemplated by the last sentence of
Section 3.9(g), all of landlords obligations to finish or refinish space to
specifications provided in the Leases have been satisfied.

  

### 

  

### (i) All work required to be performed, payments required to be made and
actions required to be taken prior to the date hereof pursuant to any
agreement entered into with a Governmental Authority in connection with a
site approval, zoning reclassification or other similar action relating to
any Company Properties (e.g., local improvement district, road improvement
district, environmental mitigation) have been performed, paid or taken, as
the case may be, other than those where, individually or in the aggregate
with any other condition or omission resulting in a breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.9, the failure
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
and the Company has no Knowledge of any material work, payments or actions
that are required after the date hereof pursuant to such agreements, except
as set forth in the leases or the 2004 Company Capital Budget.

### (j) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have good and
sufficient title to all their personal and non-real properties and assets
reflected in their books and records as being owned by them (including those
reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31,
2002 and September 30, 2003, except as since sold or otherwise disposed of in
the ordinary course of business), free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances, except for such Encumbrances reflected on the consolidated
balance sheet of Company as of December 31, 2002 and September 30, 2003, and
the notes thereto, and except for Liens for current taxes not yet due and
payable, and Liens or encumbrances which are normal to the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and are not, in the aggregate, material
in relation to the assets of the Company on a consolidated basis and except
also for such imperfections of title, easements and encumbrances, if any, as
do not materially interfere with the present use of the properties subject
thereto or affected thereby, or otherwise materially impair the consolidated
business operations of the Company.

  

### 

  

### (k) No Company Property is currently under development or subject to any
agreement with respect to development. No agreements have been entered into
by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries relating to the development
or construction of, or additions or expansions to, any real property.

  

### 

  

### (l) Since December 31, 2002, the Company has not and no Company
Subsidiary has acquired, entered into any option to acquire, or exercised an
option or other right or election or entered into any other commitment or
contractual obligation (each, a "Commitment") for the acquisition of, any
real property or other transaction involving in excess of $250,000, or
commenced construction of, or entered into any Commitment to develop or
construct other real estate projects, except in the ordinary course of its
office property business, including leasing activities.

  

### 

  

## Section 3.10 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

### (a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have timely filed all Tax
Returns (as defined herein) required to be filed.  All such Tax Returns are
accurate and complete in all material respects. The Company and each
Company Subsidiary have paid all Taxes shown as due and payable on such
Tax Returns. The financial statements contained in the most recent Company
SEC Report reflect an adequate reserve for all material Taxes payable or
accrued by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for all taxable periods
and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements.

  

### 

  

### (b) The Company and each Company Subsidiary have withheld and paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid to any employee,
independent contractor, creditor, stockholder or other third party.

  

### 

  

### (c) No deficiencies for Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing
or, to the Knowledge of the Company or a Company Subsidiary, proposed against
the Company or a Company Subsidiary that individually or in the aggregate
would be material. No waivers of the time in which to assess Taxes that
remain in effect have been executed by the Company or any

  

### 

  

### 18

### Company Subsidiary and no such waivers are pending.  There are no Liens
for Taxes on the assets of Company or the Company Subsidiaries except for
statutory Liens for Taxes not yet due.

### (d) The Company (i) has been subject to taxation as a real estate
investment trust (a "REIT") within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code
commencing with the taxable year ending December 31, 1993, and has satisfied
all requirements to qualify as a REIT for such years, (ii) has operated in
such a manner as to qualify as a REIT and (iii) has not taken or omitted to
take any action which would reasonably be expected to result in a challenge
to its status as a REIT, and no such challenge has been made or, to the

partnership, joint venture or limited liability company has been since its
formation and continues to be treated for federal income tax purposes as
either a partnership or ignored as a separate entity and not as a corporation
or an association taxable as a corporation. Each Company Subsidiary which is

profit sharing, deferred compensation, stock option, stock loan, bonus,
incentive, vacation pay, tuition reimbursement, severance pay, or other
employee benefit plan, trust, agreement, contract, arrangement, policy or
commitment (including, without limitation, any pension plan, as defined in
Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder ("ERISA")
("Pension Plan"), and any welfare plan as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA
("Welfare Plan")), whether any of the foregoing is funded, insured or self-
funded, written or oral, (i) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary (each a "Controlled Group Member") and covering any
Controlled Group Members active or former employees (or their
beneficiaries), (ii) to which any Controlled Group Member is a party or by
which any Controlled Group Member (or any of the rights, properties or assets
thereof) is bound or (iii) with respect to which any current Controlled Group
Member may otherwise have any material liability (whether or not such
Controlled Group Member still maintains such Employee Plan). Each Employee
Plan is listed on Schedule 3.11 to the Company Disclosure Schedule. With
respect to the Employee Plans:

  



  

### (a) Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports, no Controlled Group
Member has any continuing liability under any Welfare Plan which provides for
continuing benefits or coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a
participant after such participants termination of employment, except as may
be required by Section 4980B of the Code or

  

### 

  

### 20      
   

### 

  

### Section 601 ( _et_ _seq_.) of ERISA, or under any applicable state Law,

### 

  

### (b) Each Employee Plan complies in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of ERISA and any other applicable Law governing such
Employee Plan, and each Employee Plan has at all times been administered in
all material respects in accordance with all such requirements of Law, with
its terms and the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement to
the extent consistent with all such requirements of Law.  Each trust holding
the assets of a Pension Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of
the Code is tax exempt under Section 501(a) of the Code. Each Pension Plan
which is intended to be qualified is qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service (the "IRS") stating that such Plan meets the requirements of Section
401(a) of the Code and, to the Companys Knowledge, no event has occurred
which would jeopardize the qualified status of any such Plan or the tax
exempt status of the trust associated with such Pension Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. No lawsuits or claims (other than routine claims for
benefits) by any Person or Governmental Authority have been filed or are
pending, the Company has received no notice of such a lawsuit, claim or
complaint and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no fact or
contemplated event which would be expected to give rise to any such lawsuit
or claim (other than routine claims for benefits) with respect to any
Employee Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, except as disclosed on
Schedule 3.11 to the Company Disclosure Schedule, the following are true with
respect to each Employee Plan:

  

### 

  

#### (i) except for those not yet required to be filed or distributed, all
Controlled Group Members have filed or caused to be filed every material
return, report, statement, notice, declaration and other document required by
any Law or governmental agency, federal, state and local (including, without
limitation, the IRS and the Department of Labor), with respect to each such
Employee Plan, each of such filings has been complete and accurate in all
material respects and no Controlled Group Member has incurred any material
liability in connection with such filings;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) except for those not yet required to be filed or distributed, all
Controlled Group Members have delivered or caused to be delivered to every
participant, beneficiary and other party entitled to such material, all
material plan descriptions, returns, reports, schedules, notices, statements
and similar materials, including, without limitation, summary plan
descriptions and summary annual reports, as are required under Title I of
ERISA, the Code, or both, and no Controlled Group Member has incurred any
material liability in connection with such deliveries;

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) all contributions and payments with respect to Employee Plans that
are required to be made by a Controlled Group Member with respect to periods
ending on or before the Closing Date (including periods from the first day of
the current plan or policy year to the Closing Date) have been, or will be,
made or accrued before the Closing Date in accordance with the appropriate
plan document, insurance contract or arrangement or as otherwise required by
ERISA or the Code;

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) with respect to each such Employee Plan, to the extent applicable,
the Company has delivered or made available to Acquiror true and complete
copies of

  

#### 

  

#### 21      
   

####

policy or commitment and all amendments thereto, (B) the most recent
determination letter, if any, received from the IRS, (C) the three most
recent Form 5500 Annual Reports (and all schedules and reports relating
thereto) and actuarial reports and (D) all related trust agreements,
insurance contracts or other funding agreements that implement each such
Employee Plan; and

  

#### 

  

#### (v) the Company has delivered to Acquiror a true, correct and complete
copy of the form of grant agreement used for all grants under each applicable
Employee Plan, and all grant agreements entered into with respect to each
such Employee Plan are identical in all material respects, and identical in
all respects with regard to any change in control provisions, to the form of
grant agreement delivered to Acquiror. True, correct and complete copies of
the forms of grant agreements with respect to all Company Options and Company
Equity Rights are attached to Schedule 3.11 to the Company Disclosure
Schedule.

  

#### 

  

### (c) With respect to each Employee Plan, there has not occurred, and no
Person is contractually bound to enter into, any "prohibited transaction"
within the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA,
which transaction is not exempt under Section 4975(d) of the Code or Section
408 of ERISA.

  

### 

  

### (d) No Controlled Group Member has maintained or been obligated to
contribute to any Employee Plan subject to Code Section 412 or Title IV of
ERISA. With respect to each Employee Plan subject to Code Section 412 or
Title IV of ERISA set forth on such Schedule 3.11 which has been terminated,
the Company represents that each such Employee Plan has been completely
terminated in accordance with all Code and ERISA requirements for a "standard
termination" (as defined in 4041(b) of ERISA), as applicable on the
termination date.

  

### 

  

### (e) With respect to each Employee Plan document and summary plan
description maintained by any Controlled Group Member, such Plan expressly
provides that the Plan Sponsor has the authority to amend or terminate the
Employee Plan at any time, subject to applicable requirements of ERISA and
the Code, and the Company has no Knowledge of any facts or events which would
prevent the termination of any Employee Plan.

  

### 

  

### (f) The Company has no obligation to make payments to any individual to
offset, in whole or in part, any federal or state income taxes, including
Taxes imposed pursuant to the provisions of Code Sections 280G or 4999, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not
result in any such excise tax withholding.

  

### 

  

### (g) Schedule 3.11 to the Company Disclosure Schedule lists the employee
handbooks of the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries currently in
effect. A copy of each such employee handbook has previously been provided to
Acquiror.  Such handbooks accurately summarize material employee policies,

labor organization, nor has the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
agreed that any unit of their employees is

Disclosure Schedule, no declaration, filing or registration with, or notice
to or authorization, consent or approval of, any Governmental Authority is
required to be obtained, made or given by or on behalf of Acquiror,
Acquisition Sub or any other Subsidiary of Acquiror for the execution and

## Section 6.6 _Benefit Plans and Other Employee Arrangements_.

  



  

### (a) _Employees_. The Company shall terminate the employment of each
employee of the Company and each Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of this Section 6.6, Acquiror and
its Affiliates shall be entitled, but not obligated, to offer employment to
any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary on such terms and
conditions as Acquiror and/or its Affiliate deems appropriate. At
least sixty (60) days prior to the Closing Date, representatives of Acquiror
and its Affiliates shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to
interview and select the employees of the Company and any Company Subsidiary
to whom such offers of employment shall be made.  Individuals selected by
Surviving Entity or its Affiliates for employment with Surviving Entity or an
Affiliate will be provided written offers of employment on an at-will basis
as of the Effective Time and upon such other terms and conditions as shall be
determined by Acquiror and its Affiliates and the Company agrees that it will
reasonably cooperate with Acquiror and its Affiliates in transmitting such
offers of employment.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Benefit Plans_. On or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to terminate all
Employee Plans as of the Effective Time, except the Great Lakes REIT
Cafeteria Plan, which shall be frozen effective as of the Effective
Time subject to payment of any eligible benefit claims and subject to any
terminated employees COBRA (as defined herein) election regarding the
medical reimbursement accounts and except for the Companys severance plan,
which shall be terminated after payments thereunder are made to eligible
employees terminated as contemplated by Section 6.6(a) and subject to Section
3.26. The Surviving Entity or its Affiliates shall be responsible for
providing COBRA continuation coverage to all former employees of the Company
to the extent required by Law. In the event that such COBRA coverage is
not required by Law, the Surviving Entity or its Affiliates and the Company
shall use their commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain group health
insurance contracts covering such former employees for such periods and on
such terms as the Company is obligated to provide coverage to such employees
under the written employment agreements as set forth on Schedule 3.11(h) to
the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "Key Employees") and to other former
employees under the provisions of COBRA, without regard to whether such COBRA
coverage is required by Law. In the event that such continuation coverage is
provided, regardless of whether required by Law, such coverage shall be at no
cost to such Key Employee for a period of 12 months following the date such
coverage is effective with respect to such Key Employee, to the extent
provided in the Key Employees written agreement set forth on Schedule 3.11
to the Company Disclosure Schedule. In the event that such coverage is not
required by Law and neither Acquiror, nor any of its Affiliates or the
Surviving Entity is able to procure such coverage in accordance with this
Section, Acquiror shall pay, in lieu thereof, to each Key Employee a lump sum
payment in an amount equal to the cost of obtaining individual and
family coverage, as applicable, that is substantially equivalent to such
Key Employees existing health benefits as determined as of the Effective
Time through a solvent and nationally reputable health insurer willing to
provide such coverage selected by Acquiror and reasonably acceptable to the
Company. Each former employee of the Company who is hired by the Surviving
Entity or an Affiliate as an employee, shall be eligible for coverage for
health insurance benefits under the hiring entitys plan. "COBRA" means the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, as
codified in Section 601 _et seq._ of ERISA.

prior written consent of Acquiror.

  

###

the Companys Limited Purpose Employee Loan Program, to be repaid in full;
_provided_ , _however_ , all loans made to Richard May, Richard Rasley, Eric
Niederman and Raymond Braun shall be repaid in full at or prior to the
Effective Time. The repayment of any such loan may be made through the
surrender to the Company prior to the Effective Time of certificates
representing Company Common Shares with a value sufficient to satisfy any
outstanding loan balance. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall cause to be transferred to it each share certificate securing a then
outstanding loan under the Companys Limited Purpose Employee Loan Program.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Flexible Benefit Plan_. At the Effective Time, the Company shall

contributed and account balances, reimbursements paid and pending but unpaid
claims for all of the Companys current or former employees under the
Companys flexible spending plan.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Severance Policies_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
amend its severance plans or policies to the extent necessary to clarify that
no severance payments are required to be paid to the Companys employees that
are offered employment by the Surviving Entity or its Affiliates, provided
such offers of employment contain no diminution in such employees base
salary or require the employee to perform his or her duties at a location
that is more than 25 miles from the employees location of employment by the
Company.

Sub, as a result of such purchase or the exercise of such rights at or after
the Effective Time.

  

###

who are currently covered by the Companys trustees and officers liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to such coverage and in an amount no
less favorable to the Companys trustees and officers currently covered by
such insurance than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;

such policy exceed $1,030,000.

  

### 

  

### (c) This Section 6.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to

assets to any Person, then, and in each such case the successors and assigns

## Section 8.2 _Certain Fees and Expenses_.

  



  

### (a) If this Agreement is terminated (i) pursuant to Section 8.1(i) or
8.1(j), then the Company will pay Acquiror (provided the Company was not
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) at the time
of such termination) a fee equal to the Break-Up Fee (as defined herein),
or (ii) pursuant to Section 8.1(b), 8.1(f), 8.1(h) or 8.1(k), then
the Company will pay Acquiror (provided the Company was not entitled to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1(c) at the time of such
termination) an amount equal to the Expense Fee (as defined herein). If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 8.1(c), then Acquiror will pay
the Company (provided Acquiror was not entitled to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to Section 8.1(b) at the time of such termination), an amount equal
to the Expense Fee. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
8.1(g), then the Company will pay Acquiror (provided the Company was not

Section 8.1(a), 8.1(d) or 8.1(e)), and at the time of the termination of this
Agreement (x) an Acquisition Proposal has been received by the Company and
(y) either prior to the termination of this Agreement or within 12 months
thereafter the Company or any Company Subsidiary enters into any written
agreement with respect to such Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently
consummated (whether or not

  



  

48      
   



  

### such Acquisition Proposal is the same Acquisition Proposal that had been
received at the time of the termination of this Agreement), then the Company
shall pay the Break-Up Fee to Acquiror.

  

### 

  

### (b) The payment of the Break-Up Fee shall be compensation and liquidated
damages for the loss suffered by Acquiror as a result of the failure of the
Merger to be consummated and to avoid the difficulty of determining damages
under the circumstances and neither party shall have any other liability to
the other after the payment of the Break-Up Fee.  The Break-Up Fee shall be
paid by the Company to Acquiror, or the Expense Fee shall be paid by Company
to Acquiror or Acquiror to the Company (as applicable), in immediately
available funds within 15 days after the date of the event giving rise to the
obligation to make such payment occurred.

  

### 

  

### (c) As used in this Agreement, "Break-Up Fee" shall be an amount equal to
$6.5 million. The "Expense Fee" payable to Acquiror or Company, as the case
may be (the "Recipient"), shall be an amount equal to the Recipients
reasonably documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (including, without
limitation, all attorneys, accountants and investment bankers fees and
expenses) irrespective of the date of incurrence of such fees, which amount
shall not be greater than $1.0 million.

  

###

liability or obligation on the part of Acquiror or the Company, other than as
expressly provided in Section 8.2, this Section 8.3 or Article IX; _provided_
, _however_ , that (a) if this Agreement is terminated by Acquiror pursuant
to Section 8.1(b), the Company shall not be entitled to any of the benefits
of Section 8.2 and (b) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to Section 8.1(c), Acquiror shall not be entitled to any of the
benefits of Section 8.2.

Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such reference shall be to a Section or
Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively, unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words, "include," "includes," or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation."

  



  

## Section 9.6 _Counterparts; Effect_. This Agreement may be executed in one
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but
all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

## Section 9.7 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and, except for (a)
rights of Indemnified Parties as set forth in Section 6.7 and (b) as set
forth in Section 6.6, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer upon any Persons, any rights or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

  



  

## Section 9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial and Certain Damages_.  Each party to

occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were

change the rights or any of the proceedings for the treatment of shares under

extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights hereunder or otherwise shall not
constitute a waiver of such rights.

that, should any court or other competent authority hold any provision of
this Agreement to be null, void or unenforceable, or order any party to take
any action inconsistent herewith or not to take an action consistent herewith
or required hereby, the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions and obligations contained or set forth herein shall not
in any way be affected or impaired thereby, unless the foregoing inconsistent
action or the failure to take an action constitutes a material breach of this
Agreement or makes this Agreement impossible to perform, in which case this
Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Article VIII hereof. Except
as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, to the extent that a party
hereto took any action inconsistent herewith or failed to take action
consistent herewith or required hereby pursuant to an order or judgment of a

requested by any other party in order to consummate the Merger in accordance
with the terms hereof.

 ** _Form of Unitholder Agreement_**

  

      
   



  

 ** _NOTICE OF REDEMPTION_**

  



  

Reference is made to the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited
Partnership of Great Lakes REIT, L.P. dated December 19, 1996, as amended
(the "Partnership Agreement"), among Great Lakes REIT, as General Partner
(the "Company"), the undersigned, as Limited Partner, and the other limited
partners party thereto.  Capitalized terms not defined herein have the
meanings assigned to them in the Partnership Agreement.

  



  

The undersigned Limited Partner hereby irrevocably exercises the
undersigneds Redemption Right with respect to 
 Partnership Units in the Partnership in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Partnership Agreement and this Notice of Redemption;
(ii) surrenders such Partnership Units and all right, title and interest
therein; (iii) directs that any notices to the undersigned, including
without limitation, notice of the exercise by the Company (or its successors)
of its right to purchase all or any part of the undersigneds Partnership
Units on the terms set forth in the Partnership Agreement and this Notice of
Redemption, be sent to the address specified below; and (iv) directs that the
Cash Amount or Company Shares Amount deliverable upon exercise of the
Redemption Right be delivered to the address specified below, and if Company
Shares are to be delivered, such Company Shares be registered or placed in
the name(s) and at the address(es) specified below.

  



  

For purposes of this Notice of Redemption, the Specified Redemption Date
shall mean the date immediately preceding the Effective Time as defined in
the Agreement and Plan of Merger by and among the Company, the Partnership,
Aslan Realty Partners II, L.P. and Transwestern Superior Acquisition, L.L.C.,
dated January 21, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"). This Notice of
Redemption shall be deemed delivered to the Partnership and the Company on
the tenth (10th) day prior to the date immediately preceding the Effective
Time. The undersigned hereby acknowledges and agrees that (i) the purchase
pursuant to this notice of redemption shall occur automatically without need
for any additional action by the undersigned, (ii) the Company is obligated
to deliver the Company Shares Amount and not the Cash Amount under the Merger
Agreement and (iii) that the Company Shares Amount will be converted, without
the consent of the undersigned, into the Merger Consideration as defined in
the Merger Agreement upon the consummation of the merger of the Company with
and into Transwestern Superior Acquisition L.L.C.

  



  

The Company is authorized and directed, at the Specified Redemption Date, to
take all necessary action to: (i) cause the Partnership Units to be redeemed
as contemplated by this Notice of Redemption and to cause the redemption of
such Partnership Units to be recorded on the books of the Partnership, (ii)
effect such redemption against payment of the Cash Amount or Company Shares
Amount and give receipt for such redemption and (iii) pay such expenses,
including transfer taxes, as the Company may be instructed to pay by the
undersigned.

  



  

The undersigned hereby agrees that this Notice of Redemption and the
Companys authority hereunder are irrevocable and are not subject to
termination by the undersigned or

  



  

A-1      
   



  

by operation of law, whether by the dissolution or liquidation of any
corporation or other entity or the occurrence of any other event.  If any
event referred to in the preceding sentence should occur prior to the
delivery of the Cash Amount or Company Shares Amount deliverable
upon exercise of the Redemption Right, any action taken by the Company
pursuant to this Notice of Redemption shall be as valid as if such event had
not occurred, whether or not the Company shall have received notice of such
event.

  



  

The undersigned hereby acknowledges that exercise of the Redemption Right is
subject to certain restrictions and limitations set forth in the Partnership
Agreement. The undersigned hereby represents, warrants, and certifies that
the undersigned (a) has unencumbered title to such Partnership Units, free
and clear of the rights or interests of any other person or entity; (b) has
the full right, power, and authority to redeem and surrender such Partnership
Units as provided herein; and (c) has obtained the consent or approval of all
Persons or entities, if any, having the right to consent to or approve such
redemption and surrender. The undersigned further certifies, under penalties
of perjury, that (1) the number shown on this form is the correct taxpayer
identification number of the undersigned; and (2) the undersigned is not
subject to backup withholding (cross out item (2) if you are subject to
backup withholding). The foregoing representations, warranties, statements
and agreements are made for the benefit of, and may be relied upon by, the
Company and the Partnership and the representatives, agents and counsel of
each of the foregoing.

  



  

 **This Notice of Redemption shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard
to principles of conflicts of laws.**
