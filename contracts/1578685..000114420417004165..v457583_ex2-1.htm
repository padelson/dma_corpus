Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ and upon the due surrender
of the Certificated Units (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to
_Section 3.2(g)_  with respect to Certificated Units) or Book-Entry Units
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_. All such cash
deposited with the Paying Agent shall be referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions delivered by Parent at or prior to the Effective Time, deliver
the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to this _Article
III_ out of the Exchange Fund. Subject to _Sections 3.2(h)_ and _(i)_ ,
the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to pay such
Merger Consideration.

converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, upon
delivery to the Paying Agent of a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and
surrender of Certificated Units (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof pursuant
to _Section 3.2(g)_ with respect to Certificated Units) or Book-Entry Units
and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent
(including with respect to Book-Entry Units), will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a check in an amount equal to the aggregate amount of cash
that such holder has a right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. The
Merger Consideration shall be paid as promptly as practicable by mail after

lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.2(g)_ with respect to Certificated Units)
or any applicable documentation with respect to the surrender of Book-Entry
Units, and letter of transmittal in accordance with the foregoing. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration. Until so surrendered,
each such Certificated Unit and Book-Entry Unit shall, after the Effective
Time, represent for all purposes only the right to receive such Merger
Consideration.

  



  

(d) _Other Payees_. If any payment of the Merger Consideration is
to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
applicable surrendered Certificated Unit or Book-Entry Unit is registered, it
shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such payment
shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the making
of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the
surrendered Certificated Unit or Book-Entry Unit or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

  



  

(e) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration on the books of the Partnership of
transfers of Class A Common Units converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Class A Common Units
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration one year after
the Effective Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged his, her or its Class A Common Units for the
Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section 3.2_ prior to that time
shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger Consideration.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent, Merger Sub, the Partnership and the
Partnership GP shall not be liable to any holder of Class A Common Units for
any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property Laws. Any Merger Consideration remaining
unclaimed by holders of Class A Common Units immediately prior to such time as
such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any
Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  



  

(g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificated Units_. If any
Certificated Unit shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificated
Unit to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting
by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificated Unit, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificated Unit the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Class A Common Units represented by such Certificated Unit as
contemplated by this _Article III_.

  



  

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Entity and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement such
amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_
"), and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any
provision of applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax authority, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Person in respect of whom such withholding was made.

  



  

(i) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. Parent may cause the Paying
Agent to invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent on a daily basis, in Parent's sole discretion; _provided_ , _however_
, that any investment of such Exchange Fund shall be limited to cash and cash
equivalents, direct short-term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully
guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S. government and money
market funds comprised primarily of cash, cash equivalents and
such obligations and that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the
amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the holders of
Certificated Units or Book-Entry Units representing Class A Common Units
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to this _Article
III_. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be

Partnership shall file a post-effective amendment to the Form S-8

As an inducement for the Partnership to enter into this Agreement, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby represent and warrant, jointly and severally, to
the Partnership and the Partnership GP as follows:

  



  

Section 5.1 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power_. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the Law of its respective jurisdiction of organization
and has all requisite corporate or limited liability company, as applicable,
power and authority to carry on its business as presently conducted and is
duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing (where such
concept is recognized under applicable Law) in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or operation of its
properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than where
the failure to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement. Parent has made available to the Partnership prior to the
execution of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the Organizational
Documents of Parent (the " _Parent Organizational Documents_ ") and the

contemplated hereby. Except for obligations and liabilities incurred in

Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate or limited liability company action on
the part of each of Parent and Merger Sub. This Agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by each of Parent and Merger Sub and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery by the Partnership and the Partnership
GP, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in accordance
with its terms, subject, as to enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency and
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights and to general equity principles. The Parent Board has duly
and validly adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and
authorizing Parent, as sole member of Merger Sub, to cause Merger Sub to

of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the Merger and
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement will not, conflict with, or
result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of
time, or both) under, or give rise to any right (including a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or any right of
first refusal, participation or similar right) under, or cause the loss of any
benefit under, or give rise to any right of notice, acceleration or
termination under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the
properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Subsidiaries under, any provision of (i) the Parent Organizational Documents
or the Organizational Documents of any of Parent's Subsidiaries, including
Merger Sub, or (ii) subject to the filings and other matters referred to in
_Section 5.5_ , (A) any Contract to which Parent or Merger Sub or any of their

Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective

Partnership GP shall, and the Partnership shall cause its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)

intended to lead to any inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal

foregoing actions. Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood and
agreed that (a) any violation of the foregoing restrictions by
the Partnership's Subsidiaries or Representatives acting by or on behalf of
the Partnership will be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the
Partnership and (b) no act or failure to act by Parent or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives shall be a violation or breach of this _Section
6.3_ by the Partnership or the Partnership GP. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, but subject to the limitations in _Sections 6.3(c)_ and _(d)_ , at
any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Partnership, the Partnership GP
or any of their Representatives from furnishing or making available any
information or data pertaining to the Partnership, or entering into or
participating in discussions or negotiations with, any Person that makes an
unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material,
knowing and intentional breach of this _Section 6.3_ (a " _Receiving Party_
"), if, and only to the extent that (i) the GP Board after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisor and the GP Conflicts
Committee, determines in its good faith judgment (A) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is likely to result in a Superior Proposal, and (B)
that failure to take such action would be materially adverse to the interests
of the Partnership Unaffiliated Unitholders or otherwise inconsistent with
the GP Board's duties under the Partnership Agreement or applicable Law and
(ii) prior to furnishing or making available any such non-public information
to such Receiving Party, the Partnership receives from such Receiving Party
an executed Confidentiality Agreement.

  



  

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 6.3_ , the Partnership and
the Partnership GP shall not, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i)
take any action set forth in _clause (iv)_ of _Section 6.3(a)_  of this
Agreement or (ii) fail to include the Partnership Board Recommendation in the
Partnership Information Statement (the taking of any action described in
_clauses (i)_ or _(ii)_ being referred to as a " _Partnership Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood
that any violation of the foregoing restrictions by the Partnership's or the
Partnership GP's Subsidiaries, or the Partnership's or the Partnership GP's
Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 6.3_ by the
Partnership and the Partnership GP.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at
any time prior to obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, and subject
to compliance in all material respects with this _Section 6.3(c)_ , the GP
Board, after consulting with the GP Conflicts Committee, may make a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change if the GP Board determines in good
faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel and the GP Conflicts Committee) (i) that an Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (ii) that the failure to take such action
would be materially adverse to the interests of the Partnership Unaffiliated
Unitholders or otherwise inconsistent with the GP Board's duties under the
Partnership Agreement or applicable Law, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
GP Board may not effect a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant
to the foregoing unless:

  



  

(i) the GP Board has provided prior written notice to Parent
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action at least
five days in advance of its intention to take such action with respect to a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change unless at the time such notice is
otherwise required to be given there are fewer than five days prior to the
expected date of the Partnership Unitholder Approval, in which case such
notice shall be provided as far in advance as practicable (" _Notice of
Proposed Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). The Notice of Proposed Adverse
Recommendation Change shall include, if applicable, the material terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal that is the basis of the proposed action
and the identity of the Person making the proposal (it being understood and
agreed that any material amendment to the terms of any such Superior Proposal
shall require a new Notice of Proposed Adverse Recommendation Change and an
additional five day period)(the period inclusive of all such days, the "
_Partnership Notice Period_ ");

  



  

(ii) if applicable, Parent has been provided all materials and
information delivered or made available to the Person or group of
persons making any Superior Proposal in connection with such Superior
Proposal (to the extent not previously provided); and

  



  

(iii) during the Partnership Notice Period, the GP Board has
negotiated, and has used its reasonable best efforts to cause its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith
(to the extent Parent desires to negotiate in its sole discretion) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the
failure to effect such Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change would not be
materially adverse to the interests of the Partnership Unaffiliated
Unitholders or otherwise inconsistent with the GP Board's duties under the
Partnership Agreement or applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that the GP
Board or GP Conflicts Committee, as applicable, shall take into account all
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in determining
whether to make, or in the case of the GP Conflicts Committee, recommend, a
Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change.

after receipt, if any proposal, offer, inquiry or other contact is received
by, any information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Partnership in respect of any
Acquisition Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent and the GP
Board, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or other contact and the terms and conditions of any proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or contacts (and shall include with such
notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep Parent and the GP Board reasonably informed of all
material developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals,
offers, inquiries or requests (and the Partnership shall promptly provide
Parent and the GP Board with copies of any additional written materials
received by the Partnership or that the Partnership has delivered to any third
party making an Acquisition Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations.

Section 6.7 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

severally agree to (i) indemnify, defend and hold harmless against any cost or
expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments, settlements, fines and other
sanctions, losses, claims, damages or liabilities and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding, and
provide advancement of expenses with respect to each of the foregoing to, all
Indemnified Persons to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law and

directors, indemnification of officers, directors and employees and
advancement of expenses contained in the Organizational Documents of the
Partnership and the Partnership GP immediately prior to the Effective Time and
ensure that the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Entity and the
Partnership GP or any of their respective successors or assigns,
if applicable, shall, for a period of six years following the Effective Time,
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation of present and former directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Partnership and the Partnership GP than
are presently set forth in such Organizational Documents. Any right of an
Indemnified Person pursuant to this _Section 6.7(a)_ shall not be amended,

of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are no
less favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in
no event shall the Surviving Entity be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section 6.7(b)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual
premiums paid by the Partnership for such insurance (the " _Maximum Amount_
"). In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding
sentence, the Surviving Entity would be required to expend more than the
Maximum Amount, the Surviving Entity shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance as is available for the Maximum Amount. If the Partnership in its
sole discretion elects, then, in lieu of the obligations of the Surviving
Entity under this _Section 6.7(b)_ , the Partnership may (but shall be under
no obligation to), prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy" with
respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior to
the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by
such Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such.

Persons and their respective heirs and representatives; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification or
advancement set forth in this _Section 6.7_  are asserted or made within such
six-year period, all rights to indemnification and advancement in respect of
any such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of all such claims.
If the Surviving Entity and/or the Partnership GP, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or
assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary,
a proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity or the Partnership GP shall assume the obligations of the
Surviving Entity and the Partnership GP set forth in this _Section 6.7_.

transactions contemplated hereby including all legal, accounting, financial
advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third parties
incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and effectuation of
the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective party incurring such fees
and expenses, except Parent and the Partnership shall each bear and pay one
half of the expenses, other than the expenses of financial advisors or

their respective Subsidiaries of any of the provisions of this Agreement if
such action or inaction was or was not taken, as applicable, at the direction
of Parent, its Affiliates or their respective Representatives.

becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby, take
all action necessary to ensure that such transaction may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise

Partnership, the Partnership GP and Parent shall give prompt notice to the

failure of any condition set forth in _Section 7.1_ , _Section 7.2_  or

(ii) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_
shall be in effect and shall have become final and nonappealable;  _provided_
, _however_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.1(b)(ii)_ shall not be available to the Partnership or Parent if such
Restraint was due to the failure of, in the case of the Partnership, the
Partnership or the Partnership GP and in the case of Parent, Parent, Merger
Sub or EEP, to perform in all material respects any of its obligations under
this Agreement or the EEP Support Agreement, as applicable; or.

  



  

(iii) if a Partnership Adverse Recommendation Change shall have

two sentences of _Section 6.1(b)_ or _Section 6.3(a)_ ; _provided_ that Parent
shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained
in this Agreement or the EEP Support Agreement, as applicable; or

  



  

(ii) if the Partnership or the Partnership GP shall have breached or
failed to perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of the representations or
warranties of the Partnership or the Partnership GP set forth in this
Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure
of a condition set forth in _Section 7.2(a)_ or _Section 7.2(b)_ and (B)
is incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by the Partnership or the
Partnership GP within the earlier of (x) 30 days following receipt of written
notice from Parent of such breach or failure or (y) the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate

covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or the EEP Support
Agreement, as applicable.

  



  

(d) by the Partnership (duly authorized by the GP Board after
consulting with the GP Conflicts Committee) if Parent or Merger Sub
shall have breached or failed to perform any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (or if any of
the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement shall fail to be true), which breach or failure (A) would (if it
occurred or was continuing as of the Closing Date) give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 7.3(a)_ or _Section 7.3(b)_ and (B) is
incapable of being cured, or is not cured, by Parent or Merger Sub within the
earlier of (x) 30 days following receipt of written notice from the
Partnership of such breach or failure or (y) the Outside Date; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Partnership shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.1(d)_ if the Partnership or the
Partnership GP is then in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

Section 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in  _Section 8.1_ , written notice
thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the provision
of this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is made, and this
Agreement shall forthwith become null and void (other than the provisions in
_Section 6.8_ , _Section 6.16_ , _Section 8.2_ and _Article IX_ , all of which
shall survive termination of this Agreement), and, except as otherwise
provided in this _Section 8.2_ , there shall be no liability on the part of
any of Parent, Merger Sub or the Partnership and the Partnership GP or their
respective directors, officers and Affiliates, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any
failure to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby when required pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in the event of a party's intentional and material breach of this
Agreement or intentional fraud, then the other applicable party or parties
shall be entitled to pursue any and all legally available remedies, including
equitable relief, and to seek recovery of all losses, liabilities, damages,
costs and expenses of every kind and nature (including reasonable attorneys'
fees and time value of money). For the avoidance of doubt, there shall be no
liability on the part of the Partnership GP or the Partnership or their
respective directors, officers and Affiliates if this Agreement is terminated
by Parent or the Partnership pursuant to  _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the Partnership GP or the
Partnership or their respective directors, officers and Affiliates have any
liability for any matter set forth in the proviso of the first sentence of
this _Section 8.2_ for any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Partnership GP, the Partnership, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives at the direction of Parent, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

  



  

Article IX.

  



  

Miscellaneous

  



  

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc._. The representations, warranties
and agreements in this Agreement (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
schedule, instrument or other document delivered pursuant to this Agreement)
shall terminate at the Effective Time or, except as otherwise provided in
_Section 8.2_ , upon the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1_ , as the case may be, except that the agreements set forth in _Article I_
, _Article II_ ,  _Article III_ , _Section 6.7_ , _Section 6.8_ , _Section
6.16_ and _Section 6.18_ and any other agreement in this Agreement that
contemplates performance after the Effective Time shall survive the Effective
Time.

  



  

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Supplement_. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, this Agreement may be amended or supplemented in any and all
respects, whether before or after obtaining the Partnership Unitholder
Approval, by written agreement of the parties hereto, by action taken or
authorized by the Parent Board and the GP Board; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this Agreement may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the
prior approval of the GP Conflicts Committee; _provided_ ,  _further_ , that
after obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, there shall be no
amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by applicable
Law or stock exchange rule would require further approval by the Limited
Partners without such approval. Unless otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, whenever a determination, decision, approval, consent, waiver or
agreement of the Partnership or Partnership GP is required pursuant to this
Agreement (including any determination to exercise or refrain from exercising
any rights under _Article VIII_ or to enforce the terms of this Agreement
(including  _Section 9.8_ )), such determination, decision, approval,
consent, waiver or agreement must be authorized by the GP Conflicts Committee
and such action shall not require approval of the holders of Class A Common
Units.

  



    

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 9.3 _Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc_. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto, (c) waive compliance by any other party hereto with
any of the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided
herein, waive any of such party's conditions or (d) make or grant any consent
under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that neither the Partnership nor
the Partnership GP shall take or authorize any such action without the prior
approval of the GP Board (after consulting with the GP Conflicts Committee).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Partnership, the
Partnership GP, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent or Merger Sub
may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to any Subsidiary of Parent, but no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment
not permitted under this _Section 9.4_ shall be null and void.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts (each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties. Signatures to this Agreement
transmitted by facsimile transmission, by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (" _.pdf_ ") form, or by any other electronic means intended
to preserve the original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will
have the same effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the
original signature.

Section 9.6 _Entire Understanding; No Third-Party Beneficiarie_.
This Agreement and any certificates delivered by any party pursuant to this
Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement and understanding, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and
thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties
hereto any rights (including third-party beneficiary rights or otherwise) or
remedies hereunder, except for, in the case of _clause (b)_ , (i) the
provisions of _Section 6.7_ and _Section 9.11_ and (ii) subject to _Sections
3.1(d)_ and _(f)_ and _Section 3.4_ , the right of the holders of Class
A Common Units to receive the Merger Consideration after the Closing (a claim
by the holders of Class A Common Units with respect to which may not be made
unless and until the Closing shall have occurred). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement,  _Section 9.11_ shall be for the benefit of,
and enforceable by, any financing sources or lender providing financing in
connection with the Merger. Any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties set forth in this Agreement are subject to waiver by the parties
hereto in accordance with _Section 9.3_ without notice or liability to any
other Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the Knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of
this Agreement or as of any other date.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the Laws of the State of Delaware, applicable to contracts executed in
and to be performed entirely within that State, regardless of the Law that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of Law
thereof. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action
or Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware
Court of Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of
Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal court within the
State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto consents to service of process
being made upon it through the notice procedures set forth in _Section 9.9_ ,
irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or Proceeding for itself
and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
parties hereto irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or Proceeding with respect to this
Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 9.7_ , (ii) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (A) the suit,
action or Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)
the venue of such suit, action or Proceeding is improper or (C) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts. Each party hereto expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is
intended to be irrevocable under the Law of the State of Delaware and of the
United States of America; _provided_ , _however_ , that each such party's
consent to jurisdiction and service contained in this _Section 9.7(a_ ) is
solely for the purposes referred to in this _Section 9.7(a)_  and shall not
be deemed to be a general submission to such courts or in the State of
Delaware other than for such purposes.

  



    

 | 40| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR
OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE NEGOTIATION,
ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  



  

Section 9.8 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties agrees that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder in order to consummate the Merger) in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 9.8_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept personal jurisdiction, any
federal court sitting in the State of Delaware), this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided
herein on the basis that (a) either party has an adequate remedy at law or
(b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity (it being understood that nothing in this sentence
shall prohibit the parties hereto from raising other defenses to a claim for
specific performance or other equitable relief under this Agreement). Each
party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.8_ , and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications

Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy,
