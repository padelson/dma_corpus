respect to the shares of CMTY Common Stock (and the associated rights to

PRFS Options, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein for so
long as such options remain outstanding.

  

### 

  

### (d) As soon as practicable after the Effective Date, but in no event

## 2.07 _Surrender and Exchange_ _of PRFS Stock Certificates_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Exchange Fund_. On or prior to the Effective Date, CMTY
shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of
shares of PRFS Common Stock, sufficient cash and certificates representing
shares of CMTY Common Stock to make all payments and deliveries to
shareholders of PRFS pursuant to this Article II. Any cash and certificates
for CMTY Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be
referred to as the "Exchange Fund."

  

### 

  

### (b) _Exchange Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Date (and in any case no later than ten (10) Business
Days thereafter), CMTY shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each record
holder of PRFS Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Date a letter
of transmittal which shall specify that delivery of the certificates for
shares of PRFS Common Stock (each, a "PRFS Certificate") shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the PRFS Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the PRFS Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as CMTY may
reasonably specify and instructions for effecting the surrender of such PRFS
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration, as the case may be.
 Upon surrender of a PRFS Certificate to the Exchange Agent together
with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such PRFS Certificate shall be
entitled to receive within ten (10) Business Days thereafter and in exchange
therefor (i) a certificate representing, in the aggregate, the whole number
of shares of CMTY Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article II and (ii) a check in the amount equal to any cash
that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article II. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payment pursuant to this
Section 2.07.

  

### 

  

### (c) Each certificate for shares of CMTY Common Stock (each, a "CMTY
Certificate") issued in exchange for PRFS Certificates pursuant to this
Section 2.07 shall be dated the Effective Date and be entitled to dividends,
distributions and all other rights and privileges pertaining to such shares
of CMTY Common Stock from the Effective Date. Until

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

### surrendered, each PRFS Certificate shall, from and after the Effective
Date, evidence solely the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

  

### 

  

### (d) If a PRFS Certificate is exchanged on a date following one or more
record dates after the Effective Date for the payment of dividends or any
other distribution on shares of CMTY Common Stock, CMTY shall pay to the
holder of such PRFS Certificate cash in an amount equal to dividends payable
on the shares of CMTY Common Stock issued in exchange therefor and pay or
deliver any other distribution to which such shareholder is entitled. Upon
surrender of certificates for shares of PRFS Common Stock in exchange for
certificates for CMTY Common Stock, CMTY also shall pay any dividends to
which such holder of PRFS Common Stock may be entitled as a result of the
declaration of a dividend on the PRFS Common Stock by PRFS in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement with a record date prior to the Effective Date
and a payment date after the Effective Date. No interest shall accrue or be
payable in respect of dividends or any other distribution otherwise payable
under this Section 2.07(d) upon surrender of PRFS Certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party hereto shall be liable to any holder
of PRFS Common Stock for any amount paid in good faith to a public official
or agency pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law. Until such time as PRFS Certificates are surrendered to CMTY for
exchange, CMTY shall have the right to withhold dividends or any other
distributions on the shares of CMTY Common Stock issuable to such
shareholder.

  

### 

  

### (e) Upon the Effective Date, the stock transfer books for PRFS Common
Stock will be closed and no further transfers of PRFS Common Stock will
thereafter be made or recognized. All PRFS Certificates surrendered pursuant
to this Section 2.07 will be cancelled.

  

### 

  

### (f) If there is a transfer of ownership of PRFS Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of PRFS, one or more CMTY Certificates
evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper number of shares of CMTY Common
Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash in lieu of any fractional shares
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to Section 2.07(d), as applicable and appropriate, may be issued
with respect to such PRFS Common Stock to such a transferee if the PRFS
Certificate representing such shares of PRFS Common Stock is presented to the
Exchange Agent, accompanied by all

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

### documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.

  

### 

  

### (g) If any PRFS Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed PRFS Certificate, upon the making of a sworn affidavit of that fact
by the holder thereof in form satisfactory to the Exchange Agent, the Merger
Consideration, and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder
is entitled pursuant to this Section 2.07 as may be required pursuant to this
Agreement; provided, however, that the Exchange Agent may, in its sole
discretion and as a condition precedent to the delivery of the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such PRFS Certificate is entitled as a
result of the Merger, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
PRFS Certificate to deliver a bond in such amount as it may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against PRFS, CMTY or the
Exchange Agent or any other party with respect to the PRFS Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

### 

  

## 2.08 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. If CMTY shall, at any time before
the Effective Date:

  

## 

  

### (a) declare a dividend in shares of CMTY Common Stock with a record date
on or prior to the Closing Date;

  

### 

  

### (b) combine the outstanding shares of CMTY Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares;

  

### 

  

### (c) resolve to effect a split or subdivide the outstanding shares of CMTY
Common Stock with a record date on or prior to the Closing Date; or

  

### 

  

### (d) reclassify the shares of CMTY Common Stock; then, in any such event,
the number of shares of CMTY Common Stock to be delivered to PRFS
shareholders who are entitled to receive shares of CMTY Common Stock in
exchange for shares of PRFS Common Stock shall be adjusted so that each PRFS
shareholder shall be entitled to receive such number of shares of CMTY Common
Stock as such shareholder would have been entitled to receive if the
Effective Date had occurred prior to the happening of such event. (By way of
illustration, if CMTY declares a stock dividend of 5% payable with respect to
a record date on or prior to the Effective Date, the Exchange Ratio shall be
correspondingly adjusted from 1.40 to 1.47). In

  



  

19   

     
   

  



  

### addition, in the event that, prior to the Effective Date, CMTY enters
into an agreement pursuant to which shares of CMTY Common Stock would be
converted into shares or other securities or obligations of another
corporation, proper provision shall be made in such agreement so that each
PRFS shareholder entitled to receive shares of CMTY Common Stock in the
Merger shall be entitled to receive such number of shares or other securities
or amount or obligations of such other corporation as such shareholder would
be entitled to receive if the Effective Date had occurred immediately prior
to the happening of such event.

### (b) enter into or maintain or continue discussions or negotiate with any

position posted as available with CMTY, Community Banks or any other CMTY
Subsidiary. If CMTY elects to eliminate a position or does not offer the
employee a position of substantially similar job descriptions or
responsibilities at substantially the same salary level in a work location
within twenty-five (25) miles of the employees then current work location
with PRFS (referred to herein as "Comparable Employment"), CMTY will make

any PRFS Subsidiary prior to the employment termination date. The minimum
benefit for non-exempt employees shall be one (1) weeks salary, and the
maximum severance benefit will be twenty-six (26) weeks salary for PRFS non-
exempt employees.

  

##### 

  

##### (C) All employees of PRFS or of any PRFS Subsidiary as of the Closing
Date to whom CMTY does not offer Comparable Employment (as defined in Section

employee of PRFS or of any PRFS Subsidiary who shall receive any payment or
benefit pursuant to any "change in control" agreement or similar plan or
right shall be an Eligible PRFS Employee.

Subsidiary for purposes of determining eligibility for participation and

by a participant under any PRFS or PRFS Subsidiary medical or dental welfare
benefit plan with respect to the period from January 1, 2005 through the

fullest extent permitted by Pennsylvania law, including provisions relating
to advances of expenses incurred in the defense of any proceeding to the

#####

provisions in its articles of incorporation or association and bylaws
providing for exculpation of director and officer liability and its
indemnification of the Indemnified Parties to the fullest extent permitted by

applicable law or except to make changes permitted by law that would enlarge
the Indemnified Parties right to indemnification.

  

##### 

  

##### (C) CMTY shall use its reasonable best efforts (and PRFS shall
cooperate and assist prior to the Effective Date in these efforts), at no
expense to the beneficiaries, to:

(2) obtain coverage for Prior Acts of the Indemnified Parties under the DandO
Insurance policies currently maintained by CMTY;

  



  

in either case, providing at least the same coverage as the DandO Insurance

of the annual premium payment, as of the date hereof, under PRFSs current
policy in effect on the date of this Agreement) (the "Maximum Amount"). If

efforts to maintain the most advantageous policies of DandO Insurance
obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

shall be made so that the successors and assigns of CMTY shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.07(c)(v).

  

##### 

  

##### (F) The provisions of this Section 5.07(c)(v) are intended to be for
the benefit of and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or
her heirs and representatives.

  



  

##### 72   

     
   

  



  

##### (G) CMTY shall pay all expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees,
that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity and
other obligations provided for in this Section 5.07(c)(v).

  

##### 

  

#### (vi) _Retention Bonuses_. CMTY shall pay retention bonuses on account of
the Contemplated Transactions, granted in good faith reasonable amounts to be
mutually agreed upon by PRFS and CMTY prior to the Effective Date, to persons

after the operational merger of Blue Ball and Community Banks (including the
agreed upon computer system conversion).

agreement for the acquisition of any bank or other financial institution
other than PRFS whether by merger, consolidation, reorganization, stock or

Significant Subsidiary, (C) not take any action that, individually or in the
aggregate, could result in the Merger not being consummated or otherwise
materially adversely affect the ability of CMTY to consummate the
Contemplated Transactions by this Agreement in a timely manner, or (D) not
enter into any contract with respect to, or otherwise agree to commit to do,
any of foregoing contained in clauses (B) and (C) of this Section

#### 

  

#### (ix) _Shareholder Approval_. CMTY shall submit this Agreement and
a proposal relating to the Articles Amendment to its shareholders for
approval at a meeting (the "CMTY Shareholders Meeting") with the
recommendation of its Board of Directors to such shareholders (unless the
CMTY Board of Directors believes in good faith, after consultation with its
legal counsel, that such recommendation would violate the CMTY Board of
Directors fiduciary duties) to approve this Agreement and the Articles
Amendment. The CMTY Shareholders

  



  

73   

     
   

  



  

#### Meeting shall be held not later than 45 days (subject to the

or waived (other than those conditions which are to be fulfilled at the
Closing).

#### (x) _Employment Agreements_. CMTY shall offer employment agreements to

#### 

  

#### (xiii) _CMTY Board of Directors after the Effective Date_. From and

indirectly, that would result in less than six (6) current members of the
PRFS Board of Directors from serving as directors on the CMTY Board of
Directors before the expiration of the Full Term.

## 

  

### (a) By the mutual written consent of the parties hereto

  

### 

  

### (b) By CMTY or PRFS:

  

### 

  

#### (i) If there shall have been any breach of any representation, warranty
or obligation of the other party hereto (subject to the same standards as set
forth in Sections 6.01(b) or 6.02(b), as the case may be) and such breach
cannot be, or shall not have been, remedied within 30 days after receipt by
such party of written notice specifying the nature of such breach and
requesting that it be remedied; provided, that, if such breach cannot
reasonably be cured within such 30-day period but may reasonably be cured
within 60 days, and such cure is being diligently pursued, no such
termination shall occur prior to the expiration of such 60-day period;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) If the Closing Date shall not have occurred prior to August 31,
2005 (except that if the Closing Date shall not have occurred by such date
because of a breach of this Agreement by a party hereto, such breaching party
shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with this

#### 

  

#### (iii) If any Regulatory Authority whose approval or consent is required

written denial of such approval or consent and the time period for appeals
and requests for reconsideration has run; or

### (e) Prior to the mailing of the Joint Prospectus/Proxy Statement, by
PRFS, in order to concurrently enter into an agreement for an Acquisition
Transaction in accordance with and following compliance with Section 5.05 of
this Agreement; provided, however, that PRFS may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 7.01(e) if, after providing written notice (which
written notice shall be provided before the mailing of the Joint
Prospectus/Proxy Statement) to CMTY that it intends to enter into an
Acquisition Transaction (the "Acquisition Transaction Notice"), CMTY
delivers, within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such
Acquisition Transaction Notice, written notice to PRFS that CMTY will require
PRFS to hold a meeting of PRFS shareholders to consider the Merger (the

#### 

  

#### (ii) (A) the quotient obtained by dividing the CMTY Market Value as of

on the Determination Date. CMTY shall have the option of increasing the
consideration to be received by the holders of PRFS Common Stock by adjusting
the Exchange Ratio to an amount which, when multiplied by the CMTY Market
Value on the Determination Date equals $34.94. If CMTY delivers to PRFS on
the Effective Date written notice that it intends to proceed with the Merger
by paying such additional consideration, as contemplated by the
preceding sentence, then no termination shall have occurred pursuant to
this Section 7.01(f).

Community Banks, Inc.

  

750 East Park Drive

  

Harrisburg, PA 17111

  



  

Ladies and Gentlemen:

  



  

Community Banks, Inc. ("CMTY") and PennRock Financial Services Corp. ("PRFS")
are considering entering into an Agreement (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant
to which, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein: (a)
CMTY will acquire PRFS by a merger of PRFS with and into CMTY; (b)
shareholders of PRFS will receive shares of CMTY common stock and/or cash in
exchange for their shares of PRFS common stock owned on the closing date;
and (c) option holders of PRFS will receive stock options exercisable
for common stock of CMTY in exchange for options exercisable for common stock
of PRFS outstanding on the closing date (the foregoing, collectively, the
"Transactions").

  



  

I have been advised that I may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of PRFS for
purposes of certain rules issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") under the Securities Act of 1933.

  



  

I understand that CMTY is requiring, as a condition to its execution and
delivery to PRFS of the Agreement, that I execute and deliver to CMTY this
Letter Agreement. Intending to be legally bound hereby, I irrevocably agree
and represent as follows:

  



  

1\. I agree to vote or cause to be voted for approval of the Merger Agreement
all shares of PRFS common stock over which I exercise sole or shared voting
power as of the record date of the PRFS shareholder meeting at which the
Merger Agreement will be presented for approval.

  



  

2. Through the conclusion of the Transactions, I agree not to offer,
sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, or to permit the offer, sale,
transfer or other disposition of, any shares of PRFS common stock over which
I exercise sole or shared voting power or any options that I hold to acquire
shares of PRFS common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) I shall have
the right to sell on or before December 31, 2004 any shares that I have
acquired on or before such date pursuant to the exercise of an incentive or
non-qualified stock option, and (ii) after the record date for the approval
of the Transactions, I have the right to make gifts of any shares of my PRFS
common stock, or any options that I hold to acquire PRFS common stock to the
extent gifts are permitted by any applicable option plan.

  



  

3\. I agree, if I am an option holder, to exchange my options to acquire
shares of common stock of PRFS for options to acquire such number of shares
of common stock of CMTY, and at such per share exercise price, as is provided
in Section 2.06 of the Agreement, and otherwise on the same terms
and conditions as the exchanged PRFS options (unless I shall have exercised
any such option prior to the Transactions).

  



  

89   

     
   

  



  

4\. I have sole or shared voting power over the number of shares of PRFS
common stock, and hold stock options for the number of shares of PRFS common
stock, if any, set forth below opposite my signature line. CMTY recognizes
that with respect to any such shares which have been pledged to a third party
(which are specifically identified below), I will not be able to control the
voting or disposition of such shares in the event of a default.

  



  

5\. I agree not to offer, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any shares
of CMTY common stock received pursuant to the Transactions, except:

  



  

(a) at such time as a registration statement under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended ("Securities Act"), covering sales of such CMTY common stock
is effective and a prospectus is made available under the Securities Act;

  



  

(b) within the limits, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of,
Rule 145 under the Securities Act ("Rule 145"); or

  



  

(c) in a transaction which, in an opinion of counsel satisfactory to CMTY or
as described in a "no-action" or interpretive letter from the staff of the
SEC (a "No Action Letter"), is not required to be registered under the
Securities Act;

  



  

and I acknowledge and agree that CMTY is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of CMTY common stock by me or on my
behalf, or to take any other action necessary to make an exemption from
registration available.

  



  

6. CMTY shall take all steps necessary to ensure that CMTY is in compliance
with all those requirements of Rule 145 and Rule 144 with which CMTY
must comply in order for the resale provisions of Rule 145(d) to be
available to me.

  



  

7\. I agree that CMTY shall not be bound by any attempted sale of any shares
of CMTY common stock acquired by me pursuant to the Transactions, and CMTYs
transfer agent shall be given appropriate stop transfer orders and shall not
be required to register any such attempted sale, unless the sale has been
effected in compliance with the terms of this Letter Agreement; and I further
agree that the certificate representing shares of CMTY common stock acquired
by me pursuant to the Transactions by me may be endorsed with a restrictive
legend consistent with the terms of this Letter Agreement, stating in
substance as follows:

  



  

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE WERE ISSUED IN A TRANSACTION TO
WHICH RULE 145 APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED (A) IN CONFORMITY WITH
RULE 145(d), OR (B) PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (C) IN ACCORDANCE WITH A WRITTEN
OPINION OF COUNSEL, REASONABLY ACCEPTABLE TO THE ISSUER IN FORM AND
SUBSTANCE, THAT SUCH TRANSFER IS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED."

  



  

The undersigned understands and hereby further acknowledges that the legend
set forth above will be removed from any such certificate (by delivery of a
substitute certificate without such legend) and CMTY will instruct its
transfer agent to remove such legend from any such certificate, if the
undersigned delivers to CMTY (i) satisfactory written evidence that the
shares of CMTY common stock represented by any such

  



  

90   

     
   

  



  

certificate have been sold in compliance with Rule 145(d) (as such rule may
be hereafter amended) (in which case, the substitute certificate will be
issued in the name of the transferee), (ii) a No Action Letter, or (iii) an
opinion of counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to CMTY, to
the effect that public sale of shares represented by such certificate by the
holder thereof is no longer subject to the restrictions imposed by Rule 145.

  



  

8\. I represent that I have no present plan or intention to offer, sell,
exchange, or otherwise dispose of any shares of CMTY common stock to be
received in the Transactions.

  



  

9\. I represent that I have the capacity to enter into this Letter Agreement
and that it is a valid and binding obligation enforceable against me in
accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and other laws
affecting creditors rights and general equitable principles.

  



  

I am signing this Letter Agreement in my capacity as a shareholder of PRFS,
and as an option holder if I am an option holder, and not in any other
capacity (including as a director). This Letter Agreement shall be effective
upon acceptance by CMTY.

  



  

Execution of this Agreement by the undersigned is not an admission by the
undersigned that he or she is an "affiliate" for purposes of the Rule 145 of
the Securities Act.

  



  

This Letter Agreement shall terminate concurrently with, and automatically
upon, any termination of the Merger Agreement in accordance with its terms,
except that any such termination shall be without prejudice to CMTYs rights
arising out of any willful breach of any covenant or representation contained
herein.
