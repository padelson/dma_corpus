Adjustment Amount with respect to such Seller determined by reference to the

Pre-Closing Sales Settlement Amount to be paid to the applicable Reinsurer by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by
Buyer, or (ii) if the Qualifying Pre-Closing Sales Settlement Amount

(a) If Buyer disagrees with any Closing Date Statement or Prospective Post-
Closing Sales Exhibit, Buyer shall notify Sellers of such disagreement within
sixty (60) days after delivery thereof (such notice, the " _Notice of
Disagreement_ "). The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth, in reasonable
detail, any disagreement with, and any requested adjustment to, a Closing Date
Statement or Prospective Post-Closing Sales Exhibit. Matters as to which Buyer
may submit a Notice of Disagreement in respect of the Closing Date Statements
shall be limited to (i) whether the Closing Date Reference Balance Sheet was
prepared in accordance with the Reference Balance Sheet Methodology, (ii)
whether the Closing Date Transfer Balance Sheet was prepared in accordance
with the Transfer Balance Sheet Methodology, (iii) whether the Closing
Statement of General Account Net Settlement was prepared in accordance with
the Reinsurance Statement Methodology, (iv) whether the Eligible Assets were
selected in accordance with the Eligible Asset Selection Methodology and
whether the Closing Eligible Assets List was prepared in accordance with
_Section 2.3(c)(v)_ (including the calculations of the Book Value thereof)
and the Reinsurance Statement Methodology, (v) whether the Ceding Commission
Adjustment Amount was calculated in accordance with the definition of "Ceding
Commission Adjustment Amount" and the terms of this Agreement expressly
related thereto, (vi) whether the Qualifying Pre-Closing Sales Adjustment
Amount was calculated in accordance with the definition of "Qualifying Pre-
Closing Sales Adjustment Amount" and the terms of this Agreement expressly
related thereto, and (vii) whether Sellers committed any arithmetic error in
the line items or calculations set forth therein, as applicable (clauses (i)
through (vii) being the " _Permitted Factors_ "). If Buyer fails to deliver a
Notice of Disagreement by the end of such period, Buyer shall be deemed to
have accepted the Closing Date Statements and Prospective Post-Closing Sales
Exhibits delivered by Sellers. Matters included in the calculations in the
Closing Date Statements to which Buyer does not object in a Notice of
Disagreement shall be deemed accepted by Buyer (except to the extent that such
matters relate to matters that are disputed in a Notice of Disagreement), and
shall not be subject to further dispute or review.

 



 

(b) For ten (10) days after delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and
Sellers shall attempt in good faith to resolve the matters raised therein, and
any resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and Sellers shall be final and
binding upon Buyer and Sellers. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any
disagreement within such ten (10)-day period, Buyer and Sellers shall update
the Closing Date Statements or Prospective Post-Closing Sales Exhibits, as
applicable, and the Notice of Disagreement to reflect any agreement, and
jointly submit the matter to Ernst and Young LLP. In the event Ernst and Young LLP
shall decline such appointment, any Party may request that a nationally
recognized accounting firm be appointed by the American Arbitration
Association. Ernst and Young LLP or such other accounting firm appointed in
accordance with the preceding sentence, as applicable, shall be referred to
herein as the " _Accounting Firm_." The Accounting Firm shall consider only
those items and amounts set forth in the Closing Date Statements or
Prospective Post-Closing Sales Exhibits as to which any such disagreement has
not been resolved. The Parties shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm in its
review and shall promptly furnish such information as the Accounting Firm may
reasonably request in connection therewith. The Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Accounting Firm to deliver to the Parties

 



     

 

 



 

within twenty (20) days after such submission a written report setting forth
the resolution of any such disagreement, determined on the basis of the
Reference Balance Sheet Methodology, the Transfer Balance Sheet Methodology,
the Reinsurance Statement Methodology, the Eligible Asset Selection
Methodology, the definition of "Ceding Commission Adjustment Amount" and the
terms of this Agreement expressly related thereto, the definition of
"Qualifying Pre-Closing Sales Adjustment Amount" and the terms of this
Agreement expressly related thereto, as applicable, or, with respect to the
Prospective Post-Closing Sales Exhibits, _Schedule 1.1(d)(iii)_ ; _provided_ ,
with respect to the Closing Date Statements, that each individual adjustment
set forth in such report, if there are any, must arise from a Permitted
Factor; _provided_ , _further_ , with respect to the Closing Date Statements,
that the Accounting Firm shall not review or make any adjustment to a line
item on, calculation in, or other matter involving, any Closing Date Statement
not subject to a disagreement between Buyer and Sellers pursuant to this
_Section 2.4_, and the Accounting Firms determination, if not in accordance
with the position of either Sellers or Buyer, shall not be in excess of the
higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated by (i) Buyer in the
Notice of Disagreement or (ii) Sellers in the Closing Date Statements. Absent
fraud or manifest error, any such report shall be final and binding upon the
Parties and shall not be subject to review by a court or other tribunal. In
the event the Accounting Firm concludes that Buyer was correct as to sixty-
five percent (65%) or more (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then
Sellers shall pay the Accounting Firms fees, costs and expenses (with each
Seller paying such Sellers relative Pro Rata Percentage of such fees, costs
and expenses). In the event the Accounting Firm concludes that Sellers were
correct as to sixty-five percent (65%) or more (by dollar amount) of the
disputed items, then Buyer shall pay the Accounting Firms fees, costs and
expenses. In the event the Accounting Firm fails to make either such
conclusion, then Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall
each pay one-half the Accounting Firms fees, costs and expenses (with each
Seller paying such Sellers relative Pro Rata Percentage of such fees, costs
and expenses).

 



 

Section 2.5 _Ceding Commission Allocation_. Within sixty (60) days following
the final determination of the Closing Date Statements pursuant to _Section
2.3_ and _Section 2.4_, Buyer and Sellers shall attempt in good faith to
agree on a proposed schedule that allocates in accordance with Applicable Law
the Closing Ceding Commission, as adjusted pursuant to _Section 2.3_ and
_Section 2.4_, and other relevant consideration under the Code among the
assets acquired pursuant to this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (the "
_Asset Allocation Schedule_ "). If Buyer and Sellers do not agree on an Asset
Allocation Schedule during such 60-day period, then each of Buyer and Sellers
may file all their respective Tax Returns without regard to any Asset
Allocation Schedule.

The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth, in reasonable detail, any
disagreement with, and any requested adjustment to, Buyers calculation of the
Qualifying Post-Closing Sales Adjustment. If GWLA fails to deliver a Notice of

Buyers calculation of the Qualifying Post-Closing Sales Adjustment. For ten
(10) days after delivery of any Notice of Disagreement, Buyer and GWLA shall
attempt in good faith to resolve the matters raised therein, and any
resolution agreed to in writing by Buyer and GWLA shall be final and binding
upon Buyer and GWLA. If Buyer and GWLA are unable to resolve any disagreement
within such ten (10)-day period, Buyer and GWLA shall update the calculation
of the Qualifying Post-Closing Sales Adjustment and the Notice of Disagreement
to reflect any agreement, and jointly submit the matter to the Accounting
Firm. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts set
forth in the calculation of the Qualifying Post-Closing Sales Adjustment as to
which any such disagreement has not been resolved. Buyer and GWLA shall
cooperate with the Accounting Firm in its review and shall promptly furnish
such information as the Accounting Firm may reasonably request in connection
therewith. Buyer and GWLA shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Accounting Firm to deliver to Buyer and GWLA within twenty (20) days after
such submission a written report setting forth the resolution of any such

Closing Sales Adjustment Amount" and the terms of this Agreement expressly
related thereto; _provided_ , that the Accounting Firms determination shall
not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts
advocated by (i) GWLA in the Notice of Disagreement or (ii) Buyer in its
calculation of the Qualifying Post-Closing Sales Adjustment. Other than any
remedy arising from a breach of _Section 2.6(c)_, absent fraud or manifest
error, any such report shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall
not be subject to review by a court or other tribunal. In the event the
Accounting Firm concludes that Buyer was correct as to fifty percent (50%) or
more (by dollar amount) of the disputed items, then GWLA shall pay the
Accounting Firms fees, costs and expenses. In the event the Accounting Firm

calculation of the Qualifying Post-Closing Sales Adjustment are finally
resolved in accordance with this _Section2.6(a)_ , (i) Buyer shall permit GWLA
and its Representatives to review all of its and its Affiliates relevant

term is defined in _Schedule 1.1(d)(iii)_ ) shall elect not to purchase a BOLI
Contract, COLI Contract or ICOLI Contract (as each such term is defined in
_Schedule 1.1(d)(iii)_ ) or such sale is not otherwise consummated, or if such
violation otherwise reduces the amount of the Qualifying Post-Closing Sales
Adjustment, the amount of premium that would have been owed to any Seller if
such sales had been consummated or otherwise been taken into account shall be
deemed to be included in the Post-Closing BOLI Production, the Post-Closing
COLI Production and the Post-Closing ICOLI Production (as each such term is
defined in _Schedule 1.1(d)(iii)_ ), as applicable, with the Post-Closing Sale
IRR (as defined in _Schedule 1.1(d)(iii)_ ) imputed based upon reasonable

Section 3.3 _Reinsurance Transaction_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Closing and simultaneously with the consummation of the transactions
set forth in _Section 2.1_, (i) Buyer shall cause each Reinsurer to, and each
Seller shall, enter into the applicable Reinsurance Agreements, Trust

Selection Methodology and transfer to the

 



     

 

 



 

applicable Trust Account (or to the applicable Reinsurer as contemplated by
the following two sentences) Eligible Assets, determined in accordance with
the Eligible Asset Selection Methodology, with a Book Value equal to the
Initial Reinsurance Premium determined by reference to the Estimated Statement
of General Account Net Settlement for such Seller (each full group of Eligible
Assets required to be transferred pursuant to this clause (i) with respect to
each Reinsurance Agreement, a " _Transferred Portfolio_ ") plus an amount of
cash equal to the applicable Tax Gross-Up of Change in IMR determined by
reference to the Estimated Statement of General Account Net Settlement for
such Seller; and (ii) Buyer shall cause each Reinsurer to pay to each Seller
the Seller Ceding Commission for such Seller (determined by reference to the
Estimated Ceding Commission Statement) payable by such Reinsurer to such
Seller pursuant to _Section 2.2_, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account or accounts designated by Sellers in writing at least
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. With respect to each
Reinsurance Agreement, to the extent that the aggregate Fair Market Value of
the Transferred Portfolio as set forth in the Estimated Statement of General
Account Net Settlement is:

 



 

(i) less than or equal to the Required Balance calculated using the estimated
line items in the Estimated Transfer Balance Sheet, then the applicable Seller
shall transfer the entirety of the applicable Transferred Portfolio into the
applicable Trust Account and, concurrently therewith, Buyer shall cause the
applicable Reinsurer to deposit into the applicable Trust Account Eligible
Assets with a Fair Market Value equal to such deficiency (if any); or

 



 

(ii) greater than the Required Balance calculated using the estimated line
items in the Estimated Transfer Balance Sheet, then the applicable Seller
shall transfer directly to the applicable Reinsurer Eligible Assets selected
by such Reinsurer from the Eligible Assets in the applicable Transferred
Portfolio that have an aggregate Fair Market Value equal to such excess, and
shall transfer the remainder of the Eligible Assets in such Transferred
Portfolio into the applicable Trust Account.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Eligible Assets in any Transferred
Portfolio that are required to be transferred to a Trust Account pursuant to
this _Section 3.3(b)_ are Non-Trust Assets, then Sellers and Buyer (at
Buyers discretion) shall cause the applicable Seller to transfer such Non-
Trust Assets directly to the applicable Reinsurer rather than such Trust
Account and, in lieu thereof, the applicable Reinsurer shall transfer to the
applicable Trust Account cash or Eligible Assets having an aggregate Fair
Market Value equal to the Fair Market Value of the Non-Trust Assets that would
otherwise have been transferred to the applicable Trust Account.

 



 

(c) Subject to the terms of this _Section 3.3(c)_, on the date that is
twenty-four (24) months following the Effective Time (the " _Holdback Date_
"), GWLA shall be entitled to a payment, as a further adjustment to its Seller
Ceding Commission, in an amount equal to the Holdback Amount, which shall be
payable by Buyer or its designee within thirty (30) days after the Holdback
Date by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated
by GWLA; _provided_ , that the provisions set forth on _Schedule 3.3(c)_
shall apply to the obligations of the Parties under this _Section 3.3(c)_.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Sellers shall
bear all costs and expenses required to transfer Eligible Assets to the Trust
Accounts or to Reinsurers in the manner contemplated by this _Article III_;
_provided_ , that any title insurance premiums shall be borne by Buyer. In
addition, Sellers shall, at their sole cost and expense (subject to the
proviso in the immediately preceding sentence), cooperate with Buyer and use
commercially reasonable efforts to perfect the transfer of such Eligible
Assets to Reinsurers on or as soon as practicable after the Closing Date to
the extent necessary, including, for the avoidance of doubt, taking all
actions reasonably necessary to re-register or re-title Eligible Assets that
are commercial mortgage loans or similar assets and, unless Buyer elects not
to transfer such assets to the Trust in connection with the Closing,
thereafter, produce similar documentation for

 



     

 

 



 

transfers in blank to be held by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of
the relevant Trust Agreement. Such actions shall include, in the case of any
transfer of mortgages securing real property, with respect to each mortgage,
using commercially reasonable efforts to complete the following actions, as
applicable, no less than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date:

 



 

(i) preparation, execution and delivery of an assignment of mortgage in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit K_, with any jurisdiction-
specific modifications required, including the recording thereof;

 



 

(ii) preparation, execution and delivery of a customary assignment of leases
and rents in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit L_, to the
extent required in the applicable jurisdiction of such real property,
including the recording thereof;

 



 

(iii) preparation, execution and delivery of an allonge to the applicable
promissory note(s) corresponding to each mortgage;

insurance benefits, annuity benefits, account values or other benefits and
amounts under the life insurance policies and annuity Contracts that are

Policies in accordance with the DMF Policy and the DMF Methodologies.

 



 

(d) Each Separate Account (i) is duly and validly established and maintained
in all material respects under Applicable Law, (ii) is operating and, at all
times since December 31, 2016 has been operated, in compliance in all material
respects with Applicable Law and applicable Material Seller Permits and (iii)
is either not an investment company as defined under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended (the " _1940 Act_ "), in reliance on Section 3(c)(1),
3(c)(7) or 3(c)(11), or is duly registered with the SEC as an investment
company under the 1940 Act. The portion of the assets of each Separate Account
equal to the Separate Account Reserves (as defined in the Reinsurance
Agreements) and other contract liabilities of such Separate Account is not
chargeable with Liabilities arising out of any other business any

 



     

 

 



 

Seller or any of their Affiliates may conduct or may have conducted. The
Separate Accounts set forth in _Schedule 1.1(m)_ are all of the Separate
Accounts utilized in the Reinsured Business.

 



 

(e) Each Separate Account that is registered under the 1940 Act (" _Registered
Separate Account_ ") is operating and, since January 1, 2016 has been
operated, in compliance in all material respects with the 1940 Act and, since
January 1, 2016 has filed all reports and amendments of its registration
statements required to be filed, except, in each case, as would not reasonably
be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each Registered Separate Account is currently conducting its
operations, and has been, since January 1, 2016, operated with the benefit of
all exemptive relief necessary and/or in reasonable reliance with any
applicable no-action relief and has satisfied all conditions to any such
relief, respectively. Each Separate Account that is excluded from the
definition of "investment company" pursuant to Section 3(c)(1), 3(c)(7) or
3(c)(11) of the 1940 Act (" _Private Separate Account_ ") meets, and since
inception has met, the requirements of such applicable Section and has
otherwise not been required to register as a pooled investment vehicle with
the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and (ii) has not issued or had
outstanding any shares or other equity interests that are registered or
required to be registered under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act or
state securities laws. Interests in each Separate Account or the Covered
Insurance Policies through which such interests are issued have been sold
pursuant to an effective registration statement filed under the Securities Act
or are exempt from such registration. Since January 1, 2016, each registration
statement, prospectus or statement of additional information, and each
amendment or supplement thereto, relating to any Registered Separate Account,
at the time that each became effective, and each private placement memorandum
through which interests in a Private Separate Account have been sold and all
supplemental advertising material, sales brochures and sales literature
relating to any Separate Account, as of their respective mailing dates or
dates of use, (i) complied in all material respects with Applicable Law and
(ii) did not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except in the case of clause (i) or (ii), as has
not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, any
material liability to any Policy Holder. Since January 1, 2016, all material
advertising or marketing materials relating to each Separate Account that were
required to be filed with any Governmental Body have been timely filed
therewith, except where such failure to comply has not had or would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Private Separate
Account and no other person participating in an offering of securities of a
Private Separate Account in reliance on Rule 506 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act, is ineligible pursuant to Rule 506(d) of Regulation D under
the Securities Act with respect to an offering of securities in reliance on
Rule 506 of Regulation D under the Securities Act, other than any such
ineligibility the grounds for which were not known to the relevant Seller or
GWLA Subsidiary and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have been
known to such Seller or GWLA Subsidiary; nor is there any proceeding pending
or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened by any Governmental Body that
would result in the ineligibility of any Private Separate Account or any such
person participating in such an offering.

 



 

(f) Each Separate Account and each Mutual Fund to which the Sellers or any of
their Affiliates has provided investment advisory services currently is and
has been since January 1, 2016 in compliance in all material respects with its
investment objectives, investment policies and restrictions (as they may be
amended from time to time), and other applicable Covered Insurance Policy
terms and Applicable Laws, if any, except where such failure to comply has not
had or would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
Since January 1, 2016, the value of the net assets of each such Separate
Account and Mutual Fund has been determined and is being determined using
portfolio valuation methods that comply in all material respects with the
methods described in its offering documents or the requirements of any
Applicable Laws.

 



     

 

 



 

(g) Each Registered Separate Account has written policies and procedures
adopted pursuant to Rule 38a-1 under the 1940 Act in all material respects
that are reasonably designed to prevent material violations of the Federal
Securities Laws, as such term is defined in Rule 38a-1.

 



 

(h) No examinations, investigations, inspections and formal or informal
inquiries, including, without limitation, periodic regulatory examinations of
the Separate Accounts affairs and condition, civil investigative demands and
market conduct examinations, by any Governmental Body have been conducted
since January 1, 2016 or are being conducted as of the date hereof.

 



 

(i) Since January 1, 2016, no notice has been received from and no
investigation, inquiry or review is pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
threatened by any Governmental Body which has jurisdiction over the Separate
Accounts (i) with respect to any alleged material violation by any Seller or
its Affiliates (in each case, to the extent related to the Reinsured Business)
of any Applicable Law or (ii) with respect to any alleged failure to have, or
any threatened revocation of, any Material Seller Permits required in
connection with the Separate Accounts.

 



 

(j) Since January 1, 2016, each Covered Insurance Policy that is a security
and is registered, or required to be registered, with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act has been (i) offered and sold, and all purchase payments under
such Covered Insurance Policies have been received, pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act or (ii) offered and sold in
reasonable reliance upon an applicable exemption from the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. Since January 1, 2016,
each private placement memorandum, prospectus, offering document, sales
brochure, sales literature or advertising material, as amended or
supplemented, relating to any such Covered Insurance Policy, as of their
respective mailing dates or dates of use, (A) complied in all material
respects with Applicable Law, and (B) did not contain any untrue statement of
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except in the case
of clause (A) or (B), any such non-compliance, statement or omission that has
not resulted in, and would not reasonably be expected to result in, any
material liability to any holder of such a Covered Insurance Policy.

 



 

(k) None of Sellers or any of their Affiliates, with respect to the Reinsured
Business, has engaged in any violation of any fiduciary duty under ERISA or
any non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code with respect to the ERISA Separate Accounts, in each case,
that individually or in the aggregate, have had, or would reasonably be
expected to result in, a material Liability to any Policy Holder. None of the
general account assets of any Seller relating to the Reinsured Business are
treated as plan assets for any purpose of Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code by reason of the application of any Applicable Law.

 



 

(l) Sellers or their Affiliates paid all material guaranty fund assessments
that have been due, claimed or asserted by, or that are the subject of any
voluntary contribution commitment to, any state guaranty fund or association
or any Governmental Body charged with the supervision of insurance companies
in any jurisdiction in which the Reinsured Business operates. Except for
regular periodic assessments in the ordinary course of business, assessments
based on developments that are publicly known within the insurance industry or
such assessments as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material
to the Reinsured Business, taken as a whole, no claim or assessment against
Sellers or their Affiliates, with respect to the Reinsured Business, is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, threatened against Sellers or such
Affiliates, with respect to the Reinsured Business, in writing, by any state
insurance guaranty association in connection with such associations fund
relating to insolvent insurers, and since December 31, 2016, neither Sellers
nor their Affiliates have received written notice of any such claim or
assessment.

 



     

 

 



 

(m) None of Sellers has engaged in any unlawful or prohibited market conduct
with respect to the Reinsured Business.

 



 

(n) Sellers and their Affiliates, as applicable, have at all times complied
with Applicable Law, applicable actuarial standards and the terms of the
Covered Insurance Policies in effecting changes to Non-Guaranteed Elements
with respect to the Covered Insurance Policies.

 



 

Section 5.19 _No Brokers_. Except with respect to the fees of Goldman, Sachs and
Co., for which Sellers or their Affiliates are solely responsible, no Seller
nor any Person acting on its behalf has paid or become obligated to pay any
fee or commission to any broker, finder or intermediary for or on account of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(xiv) fail to timely file with the Governmental Body responsible for the
regulation of insurance in the U.S. jurisdiction of domicile or port of entry
of any Seller all annual and quarterly statutory financial statements and
other material insurance regulatory filings to the extent related to the
Business that are required to be filed by Applicable Law; or

 



 

(xv) authorize, agree or enter into any Contract to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.1(a)_ to the contrary, during the
thirty (30) days prior to the date that the Closing is reasonably anticipated
to occur, and until the Closing occurs, Buyer shall be permitted to withhold
consent for any new hire or internal transfer, reassignment, or reallocation
of Business Employees duties and responsibilities if it determines that
consenting to such hire or change would cause undue burden or would otherwise
impede the timely transfer of such Person in accordance with the requirements
of _Section 8.1_. In the event the date of the Closing is subsequently
delayed, or reasonably

 



     

 

 



 

expected to be delayed, this provision shall cease to apply until thirty (30)
days prior to the new, expected Closing Date.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof until the Closing, each Seller agrees that it will
not sell, transfer, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Eligible Asset in the
Specified Investment Portfolio or the Modco Specified Investment Portfolio
except (i) to manage the credit risk related to any such Eligible Asset if the
applicable Seller reasonably determines in good faith that such Eligible Asset
has or may be subject to credit-related impairments or credit-related losses
in value, (ii) to comply with any call rights, preemptive rights, rights of
first offer, rights of first refusal or similar rights, in each case pursuant
to the terms of such Eligible Assets, (iii) with respect to either CLAC or
GWL, to fund Liabilities arising under the Covered Insurance Policies of such
Seller, including payment of claims and with respect to terminations and
withdrawals of Policy Holders; _provided_ , that the sale, transfer, pledge or
disposal is in accordance with the priorities set out in the Eligible Asset
Selection Methodology, or (iv) to cause the Eligible Assets to be in
compliance with the requirements of Applicable Law or the investment
guidelines set forth on _Section 7.1(b) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_
(the " _Specified Investment Guidelines_ "). From the date hereof until the
Closing, each Seller shall manage the Specified Investment Portfolio and the
Modco Specified Investment Portfolio in accordance with the Specified
Investment Guidelines and shall not add (through acquisition, allocation or
transfer) any Eligible Assets to the Specified Investment Portfolio or the
Modco Specified Investment Portfolio except in accordance with the Specified
Investment Guidelines. Sellers shall, within twenty (20) Business Days
following the end of each calendar month (or in the case of year-end, thirty
(30) Business Days) from the date hereof until the Closing, deliver to Buyer,
(x) a list of the Eligible Assets held by Sellers and allocated to the
Specified Investment Portfolio and the Modco Specified Investment Portfolio,
(y) a list of the Eligible Assets from the Specified Investment Portfolio and
the Modco Specified Investment Portfolio that were sold or otherwise disposed
of during the preceding month, the reason for such sale or disposition (which
shall be consistent with the first sentence of this _Section 7.1(b)_), and a
description of the original cost and tax basis of such sold Eligible Assets
and (z) a list of the Eligible Assets acquired for, or otherwise transferred
or allocated to, the Specified Investment Portfolio the Modco Specified
Investment Portfolio during the preceding month.

 



 

(c) After the Closing Date and for so long as the Barbados Treaty remains
outstanding, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or the
Barbados Treaty, CLAC shall not sell, transfer, pledge, or otherwise dispose
of, or waive or exercise any rights under or take any other action with
respect to, the Eligible Assets in the Modco Specified Investment Portfolio
without Buyers prior written consent, and shall take all actions with respect
to the Eligible Assets in the Modco Specified Investment Portfolio as Buyer
may reasonably request, except (i) to manage the credit risk related to any
such Eligible Asset if CLAC reasonably determines in good faith that such
Eligible Asset has or may be subject to credit-related impairments or credit-
related losses in value, (ii) to comply with any call rights, preemptive
rights, rights of first offer, rights of first refusal or similar rights, in
each case pursuant to the terms of such Eligible Assets, or (iii) to cause the
Eligible Assets to be in compliance with the requirements of Applicable Law or
the Specified Investment Guidelines.

 



 

(d) If, prior to the Closing Date, either:

 



 

(i) Buyer becomes aware, and promptly notifies Sellers, that any of the
representations and warranties set forth in:

 



 

(A) paragraphs 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 or 22
on _Schedule 5.2(e)_ are untrue or inaccurate with respect to any Commercial
Mortgage Loan; or

 



      

 

 



 

(B) paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, 18 or 23 on _Schedule 5.2(e)_ are untrue or
inaccurate with respect to any Commercial Mortgage Loan and the failure of
such representations and warranties referenced in this clause (B) to be true
and accurate would reasonably be expected to have a materially negative effect
on the economic value of such Commercial Mortgage Loan;

 



 

and in the case of (A) or (B) the failure to be true or accurate is either not
capable of being cured by the date that is ten (10) days prior to the Closing
Date or, if capable of being cured, is not cured by such date; or

 



 

(ii) any Institutional Private Placement suffers a downgrade from any rating
agency below Investment Grade,

 



 

then Buyer may require Sellers to remove the applicable Eligible Asset from
the Specified Investment Portfolio or the Modco Specified Investment
Portfolio, as applicable, and replace such Eligible Asset in the Specified
Investment Portfolio or Modco Specified Investment Portfolio, as applicable,
with an Eligible Asset acquired or allocated in accordance with the Specified
Investment Guidelines.

 



 

Removal of any Eligible Asset from the Specified Investment Portfolio or Modco
Specified Investment Portfolio in accordance with the foregoing shall be
treated as if such Eligible Asset was sold for purposes of calculating the Tax
Gross-Up of Change in IMR.

 



 

The failure of Buyer to give a timely notice pursuant to this _Section
7.1(d)_ shall not relieve Sellers obligation to replace Eligible Assets
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)_ except to the extent Sellers are actually
prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

Section 7.2 _Access to Information_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Closing, each Seller shall, and GWLA shall cause the GWLA
Subsidiaries to, give Buyer and its authorized Representatives, upon
reasonable advance notice and during regular business hours, reasonable access
to all books, records (including the Business Records), personnel, officers
and other facilities and properties of the Business, the Acquired Assets or
the Assumed Liabilities and to the employees and officers of Sellers and the
GWLA Subsidiaries as Buyer may reasonably request; _provided_ , that any such
access shall be conducted in accordance with Applicable Law (including any
Applicable Law relating to antitrust, competition, employment or privacy
issues), under the supervision of Sellers or their Affiliates personnel and
in such a manner as to maintain confidentiality and not to unreasonably
interfere with the normal operations of Sellers and their Affiliates. Without
limiting the terms thereof, the June 8, 2018 Confidentiality Agreement shall
govern the obligations of Buyer and its authorized Representatives and
Affiliates with respect to all information of any type furnished or provided
to them pursuant to this _Section 7.2(a)_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or
any other agreement between Buyer and any Seller executed on or prior to the
date hereof, Sellers shall not have any obligation to make available to Buyer
or its Representatives, or provide Buyer or its Representatives with (i)
access to or copies of any personnel file or related records of any Business
Employee, except as expressly contemplated with respect to Other Business
Employees in _Section 8.1(a)(i)_, (ii) any Tax Return filed by a Seller or
any of its Affiliates or predecessors, or any related material, (iii) access
to or copies of the portion of any such books or records solely to the extent
relating to the Excluded Businesses, or (iv) any other information if (A) such
information is subject to any attorney-client privilege, the work product
immunity

 



     

 

 



 

or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine and (B) making such
information available to Buyer would contravene any Applicable Law, Court
Order, Regulatory Agreement, fiduciary duty or Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to a non-affiliated Person as of the date hereof
(including any confidentiality agreement to which a Seller or any of its
Affiliates is a party as of the date hereof), it being understood that each
Seller shall reasonably cooperate and use commercially reasonable efforts in
connection with any requests for waivers that would enable otherwise required
disclosure to Buyer to occur without so contravening such Applicable Law,
Court Order, duty, Contract or obligation, including by entering into a
customary joint defense agreement or common interest agreement with Buyer.
Notwithstanding (A) above, the Parties acknowledge and agree that for any
legal opinion or similar document that relates primarily or exclusively to the
Covered Insurance Policies, the Parties assert a joint and common interest
that is intended to preserve the legal privilege or immunity concerning such
opinions or documents and the Parties will take all commercially reasonable
actions requested by the other Party to preserve such legal privilege or
immunity. If Buyer requests access to any legal opinion or similar document,
the applicable Seller shall deliver the requested legal opinion or similar
document to Buyer provided that the applicable Seller is able to do so without
waiving attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or any other
legal privilege or similar doctrine, including through a joint or common
interest that would preserve such legal privilege.

 



 

Section 7.3 _Notifications_.

 



 

(a) Prior to Closing, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers, and each Seller
shall promptly notify Buyer, of the occurrence, to the Knowledge of Buyer or
to the Knowledge of Sellers, as applicable, of:

 



 

(i) any event that would reasonably be expected to result in any of the
conditions set forth in _Article IX_ or _Article X_, as applicable, not
being capable of being fulfilled by the Termination Date;

 



 

(ii) any written notice received by such Party from a Governmental Body
seeking to restrain or prohibit the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; or

 



 

(iii) the commencement of any Action against such Party that would reasonably
be expected to adversely affect the ability of such Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(b) Prior to Closing, each Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the
existence, to the Knowledge of Sellers, of any facts, events, developments,
changes, effects or occurrences that have resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result, in a breach of any of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_ or _(f)_.

 



 

(c) The delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall not limit
or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the Party receiving
such notice. A breach of this _Section 7.3_ shall not be considered for
purposes of determining the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
_Article IX_ or _Article X_, give rise to a right of termination or give
rise to a right to indemnification under this Agreement if the underlying
breach or breaches would not result in the failure of the conditions set forth
in _Article IX_ or _Article X_ to be fulfilled, the right to terminate this
Agreement or the right to obtain indemnification, as the case may be.

 



 

(d) Prior to Closing, each Seller shall promptly notify Buyer of the
existence, to the Knowledge of Sellers, of any facts, events, developments,
changes, effects or occurrences that have resulted, or would reasonably be
expected to result, in a breach of any of the representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 5.2(e)_ or _(f)_.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 7.4 _Efforts and Actions to Cause the Closing to Occur_.

 



 

(a) _Governmental Consents_.

 



 

(i) Prior to Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, each Party and its Affiliates shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to (A) within twenty (20) days after the date hereof, prepare and
file all forms, applications, registrations, notices and other materials
required to be filed by such Party or its Affiliates with any Governmental
Body to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and (B) promptly obtain all Governmental Consents that
may be or become necessary in connection with such Partys or its Affiliates
authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and each
Ancillary Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, including by using commercially reasonable efforts to (1)
seek to prevent the initiation of, and defend, any Action by or before any
Governmental Body challenging this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and (2) avoid
the entry of, or cause to be lifted or rescinded, any Court Order or
Regulatory Agreement entered by or with any Governmental Body adversely
affecting the ability of the Parties to consummate the transactions
contemplated this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

 



 

(ii) If (x) any Governmental Body shall have imposed, or shall have indicated
that it may refuse approval without certain identified modifications or
impose, conditions on its approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or shall seek, or shall have indicated
that it may seek, an injunction or the enactment, entry, enforcement or
promulgation of any Applicable Law restraining or prohibiting the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or (y) any permanent
or preliminary injunction or other order is entered or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and by the Ancillary Agreements in
accordance with the terms hereof and thereof unlawful or that would prevent or
delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, then, to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain
approval or comply with such conditions or to prevent the taking of such
action or the enactment, entry, enforcement or promulgation of any such
Applicable Law or to vacate, modify or suspend any such injunction or order,
Buyer shall, subject to the immediately following sentence, offer to accept,
and upon such acceptance, comply with, any order, any such identified
modification or condition imposed on Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, including this _Section 7.4(a)_, neither Buyer
nor any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to take or refrain from taking,
or to agree that it or any of its Affiliates will take or refrain from taking,
any action, or to suffer to exist any condition, limitation, restriction or
requirement, in each case, imposed by any Governmental Body in connection with
the foregoing sentence that, individually or in the aggregate with any other
actions, conditions, limitations, restrictions or requirements, in each case,
imposed by a Governmental Body in connection with the foregoing sentence, that
would or would reasonably be expected to (1) have a Material Adverse Effect,
(2) materially and adversely restrict the ability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates, taken as a whole, to conduct its businesses after the Closing Date
or (3) result in a material impairment of the

 



     

 

 



 

aggregate economic benefits, taken as a whole, that, as of the date hereof,
Buyer and its Affiliates reasonably expect to obtain from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (each of the
foregoing, a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

 



 

(iii) Prior to Closing, if any Party or an Affiliate thereof receives an
inquiry or request for information or documentary material from any
Governmental Body with respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, then such Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, or cause to be provided, to
such Governmental Body, as promptly as practicable and after consultation with
the other Party, an appropriate response to such inquiry or request.

 



 

(iv) Prior to Closing, the Parties shall keep each other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining the requisite Governmental Consents, including:

 



 

(A) reasonably cooperating with each other in connection with any requisite
Governmental Consents in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements;

 



 

(B) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Body with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements;

 



 

(C) furnishing each other with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of all necessary filings, submissions, amendments or responses to
any Governmental Body;

 



 

(D) providing each other with draft copies and as-filed copies of all filings,
submissions, amendments or responses with Governmental Bodies and, to the
extent reasonably practicable, providing each other with a reasonable
opportunity to comment upon all such draft copies; _provided_ , that each
Party may redact from such copies provided to the other Party any confidential
information of such Party or its Affiliates;

 



 

(E) not participating in any substantive meeting, discussion or conversation
with any Governmental Body in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, unless it consults with the other
Party in advance to the extent it is reasonably practicable to do so; and

 



 

(F) consulting and cooperating with one another in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of either Party hereto in
connection with any Governmental Consents related to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 



     

 

 



 

(v) Prior to the Closing, GWLA and Buyer shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Colorado Division of Insurance, effective as
of the Closing Date, to (A) waive the need for the approval identified in
_Section 7.4(a)(v) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_ (the " _Transfer
Approval_ ") thereby permitting GWLA (on behalf of Buyer) to transfer assets
from the separate account of its index-linked variable annuities that are
Covered Insurance Policies to the general account without such approval or (B)
replace the Transfer Approval with an approval that (1) extends the term
thereof (unless the Colorado Division of Insurance otherwise clarifies that
such approval requirement only applies to new business and is not required for
the business plan that Buyer presents) and (2) permits GWLA (on behalf of
Buyer) to transfer assets from such separate account to the general account
without conditions that require that GWLA to maintain a particular financial
condition (including a certain level of RBC or capital and surplus) ("
_Financial Conditions_ ").

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, subject to the foregoing, each Party shall have
all final decision-making authority with respect to determining and
implementing the strategy to obtain all consents, approvals, waivers and
authorizations required to be obtained by it.

 



 

(b) _Third-Party Consents_.

 



 

(i) Prior to the Closing, except as otherwise agreed by the Parties (including
in _Section 8.5_), each Party shall cooperate with the other and use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all Third-Party Consents reasonably
necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements, including the Third-Party
Consents set forth in _Section 7.4(b)(i) of the Business Disclosure
Schedule_; _provided_ , that neither Party shall be required to commence or
participate in litigation to obtain any such Third-Party Consent. To the
extent the Parties reasonably determine they will not be able to obtain any
Third-Party Consent set forth on _Section 9.5 of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule_ by the Termination Date, the Parties shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to explore and implement a commercially reasonable
alternative that would be to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyer. If the
costs of any such commercially reasonably alternative arrangement exceed the
costs that would have been incurred had the applicable Third-Party Consent
been obtained, such excess costs shall be governed by _Section 7.4(b)(iii)_
and shall be counted as Third-Party Consent costs thereunder.

 



 

(ii) To the extent that any Acquired Asset may not be transferred or assigned
to Buyer without a Third-Party Consent that has not been obtained by the
Closing, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to transfer or
assign the same if an attempted transfer or assignment would constitute a
breach or other contravention thereof or would be ineffective or unlawful. If,
on the Closing Date, any Third-Party Consent required to effect the transfer
of any Acquired Asset to Buyer is not obtained, or if an attempted transfer or
assignment thereof would be ineffective or unlawful, then the Parties shall
reasonably cooperate to come to a mutually agreeable arrangement in compliance
with Applicable Law pursuant to which, until the earlier of (i) such time as
any Third-Party Consent is obtained therefor and the same is sold and assigned
to Buyer pursuant to an assignment and assumption agreement (or such earlier
time as may be specified by Buyer, as applicable, in writing to Sellers in the
sole discretion of Buyer) or (ii) the earlier of

 



     

 

 



 

(A) the three (3) year anniversary of the Closing and (B) the time at which
such Acquired Asset would no longer have been available to Sellers or their
Affiliates pursuant to Contracts in effect on the Closing Date: (1) such
Acquired Asset would be held, from and after the Effective Time, by Sellers or
the applicable GWLA Subsidiary in trust for the benefit of Buyer and all
benefits and obligations existing thereunder would be for the account of Buyer
and Buyer would obtain the benefits and assume the obligations and bear the
economic burdens associated with such Acquired Asset in accordance with this
Agreement; (2) Buyer would timely pay, perform or otherwise discharge (in
accordance with the respective terms and subject to the respective conditions
thereof, and in the name of Sellers or the applicable GWLA Subsidiary) all of
the covenants and obligations of Sellers or the applicable GWLA Subsidiary
incurred after the Effective Time with respect to such Acquired Asset; and (3)
Sellers would, and GWLA would cause the applicable GWLA Subsidiary to, take or
cause to be taken such actions in its name or otherwise as Buyer may
reasonably request so as to provide Buyer with the benefits of such Acquired
Asset and to effect the collection of money or other consideration that
becomes due and payable under such Acquired Asset, and would promptly pay over
to Buyer all money or other consideration received by it in respect of such
Acquired Asset. From and after the Closing Date for so long as the Transition
Services Agreement remains in effect, the Parties shall continue to use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable, any
such required Third-Party Consents that have not been obtained as of the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that neither Party shall be required to commence or
participate in litigation to obtain any such Third-Party Consent.

 



 

(iii) Sellers and Buyer shall each bear their own and their respective
Affiliates internal costs to obtain such Third-Party Consents. Any out-of-
pocket costs, whether incurred before or after Closing (including any license
or other fees and expenses and, for the avoidance of doubt, all Consent Costs
(as defined in the Transition Services Agreement)), associated with obtaining
any Third-Party Consent (other than any such consent arising from Buyer or a
Reinsurer providing services under the Administrative Services Agreement or
the Retained Business Administrative Services Agreement, which shall be borne
by Buyer) or obtaining rights to replace any related assets shall be borne
fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers until Buyer
has incurred $2,500,000 of such costs, in the aggregate, after which Sellers
shall bear 100% of such costs.

 



 

(iv) In connection with seeking any Third-Party Consents relating to minimum
retention requirements under Existing Reinsurance Agreements, "commercially
reasonable efforts" for purposes of this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall not be deemed
to obligate a Seller or any of its Affiliates to make any payments or
otherwise pay any consideration to any Person in connection with any such
Third-Party Consents. If the Parties reasonably determine that such a Third-
Party Consent is not likely to be obtained, then the Parties will negotiate in
good faith the proposed treatment of the relevant Existing Reinsurance
Agreement, including the possibility of terminating, recapturing or novating
the same. If, prior to the Closing Date, all of the reinsurers under each of
the relevant Existing Reinsurance Agreements have executed and delivered to a
Seller or any of its Affiliates a letter or other document evidencing their
consent to, or irrevocable waiver of all restrictions contained in such
Existing Reinsurance Agreements relating to, the reinsurance of the Covered
Insurance Policies as contemplated under the applicable Reinsurance Agreement,

 



     

 

 



 

then the parties shall update the form of Reinsurance Agreement to remove the
provisions relating to the treatment of non-consenting reinsurers. From and
after the Closing Date, Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer if any such
reinsurer notifies a Seller or its applicable Affiliates in writing that it
will not consent to such reinsurance or waive any such restrictions.

 



 

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.4(b)_ to the contrary, the
failure to obtain any Third-Party Consent shall not (x) constitute a failure
to satisfy any condition set forth in _Article IX_ or _Article X_ or (y)
otherwise relieve any Person from its obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

Section 7.5 _Shared Contracts_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date and for so long as the Transition Services
Agreement remains in effect, each applicable Seller shall, and GWLA shall
cause the applicable GWLA Subsidiaries to, cooperate with Buyer to the extent
reasonably requested by Buyer to cause the counterparty to any Shared Contract
of such Seller or such GWLA Subsidiary that is not a Transferred Contract to
enter into a new agreement, or an amendment or assignment of such Shared
Contract, with Buyer with respect to the matters addressed by such Shared
Contract that are related to the Business such that the identifiable and
severable portions of such Shared Contracts that are related to the Business
may be transferred to Buyer.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing Date and for so long as the Transition Services
Agreement remains in effect, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
cooperate with Sellers to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers to cause
the counterparty to any Shared Contract that is a Transferred Contract to
enter into a new agreement, or an amendment or assignment of such Shared
Contract, with a Seller or its Affiliates with respect to the matters
addressed by such Shared Contract that are not related to the Business such
that the identifiable and severable portions of such Shared Contracts that are
not related to the Business may be transferred to the applicable Seller or
their applicable Affiliates.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Terminating and Novated Reinsurance_. Prior to the Closing, each
applicable Seller shall terminate the Existing Reinsurance Agreements set
forth on _Section 7.6 of the Business Disclosure Schedule_ (the "
_Terminating Reinsurance Agreements_ ") and recapture in full the liabilities
ceded thereunder. At the Closing each of Buyer and CLAC shall, and GWL shall
cause London Life Insurance Company (Barbados Branch) to, consummate the
novation of the Barbados Treaty by entering into an Assignment and Novation
Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit N_ (the " _Novation
Agreement_ "). Prior to the Closing, Sellers shall cause the Barbados Treaty
not to be amended or modified in any respect, and shall cause the parties
thereto not to waive any of its rights, or the other partys obligations,
under the Barbados Treaty.

 



 

Section 7.7 _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement, Sellers and their Affiliates shall not, and
shall cause their Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit,
initiate, support, encourage, facilitate or accept any inquiries, proposals,
offers or other indications of interest by or from any Person other than
Buyer, Reinsurers and their respective Affiliates acting together (the "
_Acquisition Parties_ ") with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into, maintain, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions,
conversations, negotiations or other communications with any Person other than
the Acquisition Parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, (iii) furnish
or confirm any information to any Person other than the Acquisition Parties in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) otherwise assist, facilitate or
encourage the making of, or cooperate in any way regarding, any inquiry,
proposal, offer, request or other indication of interest by or from any Person

 



     

 

 



 

other than the Acquisition Parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal, or
(v) enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, agreement or other non-
binding or binding understanding or arrangement (whether oral or written)
with, or accept or agree to any offer or proposal by or from, any Person other
than the Acquisition Parties with respect to an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) From the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the Closing Date or
the termination of this Agreement, Sellers and each of their Affiliates shall,
and shall cause their respective Representatives to, cease and terminate
immediately any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with respect
to or in furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal with any Person other than
the Acquisition Parties.

 



 

(c) For purposes of this _Section 7.7_, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
of the following transactions, whether direct or indirect (but excluding, in
each case, this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby): (i) any acquisition, purchase or other
transaction involving the direct or indirect sale or transfer of all or any
material portion of the Business or the Acquired Assets (excluding reinsurance
or sales of investment assets in the ordinary course of business), (ii) any
merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization, dissolution,
recapitalization or similar transaction involving the transfer of any material
portion of the Business or the Acquired Assets, or (iii) any bulk reinsurance
or similar transaction involving all or any material portion of the Business
or the Acquired Assets (excluding reinsurance in the ordinary course of
business).

 



 

Section 7.8 _No Program or Policy of Replacement_. From the date hereof until
the Closing Date, each Seller shall, and GWLA shall cause the applicable GWLA
Subsidiaries to, comply with Section 2.10 of each form of Reinsurance
Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ as if the provisions thereof were in
full force and effect throughout such period.

 



 

Section 7.9 _Separation and Migration Cooperation_. From the date hereof until
the Closing Date, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith Schedule 2.1(a) to
the form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto at _Exhibit G_
(with the Parties acknowledging that the pricing for "Services" by category of
Services included in Schedule 2.1(a) thereof shall be governed by footnote 5
in the form of Transition Services Agreement attached hereto as _Exhibit G_)
and shall discuss in good faith planning for the provision of services
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and planning for the migration
and integration of the Business to and into Buyer, in accordance with mutually
acceptable timetables, guidelines and procedures (which shall comply with
Applicable Law), with such cooperation to include each of Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer, on the other: (i) appointing a divestiture planning manager;
(ii) establishing divestiture planning committees as mutually agreed; (iii)
setting regular meetings of the divestiture planning committees; (iv) making
reasonably available appropriate knowledgeable business, operations,
administration and technology personnel and any other personnel reasonably
needed for the planning for the provision of services pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement and the planning for the migration and
integration of the Business; (v) developing detailed project plans for the
provision of services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and the
migration and integration of the Business; (vi) using commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly identify any and all services to be provided under the
Transition Services Agreement from the potential services (and corresponding
pricing) identified in the schedules to the form of Transition Services
Agreement attached hereto at _Exhibit G_ (vii) using commercially reasonable
efforts to finalize the Separation and Migration Plan (as defined in the
Transition Services Agreement) and incorporate it into the form of Transition
Services Agreement to be executed and delivered at Closing, and (viii)
dedicating commercially reasonable resources to accomplish the foregoing. All
planning cooperation contemplated by this _Section 7.9_ shall be conducted in
compliance with Applicable Law and otherwise with the intention to minimize
disruption to the businesses of the Parties. _Schedule 7.9_ sets forth a list
of events relating to the Business that are scheduled to occur following the
expected Closing Date, and the expenses for such events that will become due
and payable prior to the expected Closing Date. Following the date hereof, the
Parties shall discuss in good faith the events listed

 



     

 

 



 

on _Schedule 7.9_ , and as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
hereof (and in any event prior to any expenses listed on _Schedule 7.9_
becoming due and payable), Buyer shall inform GWLA in writing whether Buyer
intends to participate in each such event if it occurs after the expected
Closing Date. With respect to the events in which Buyer has informed GWLA in
writing that it intends to participate, GWLA shall pay the related expenses if
they become due and payable prior to the Closing Date, and, to the extent such
events have not occurred prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall reimburse GWLA
for the paid expenses with respect to such events at the Closing.

 



 

Section 7.10 _Certain Existing Reinsurance Agreements_. The Parties shall
comply with the provisions of _Schedule 7.10_.

 



 

Section 7.11 _Loan Files and Servicing Files_. Within forty-five (45) days
after the date hereof, Sellers shall (i) provide Buyer and Reinsurers with
access in a single location to the Loan File with respect to each Commercial
Mortgage Loan and the Servicing File with respect to each Commercial Mortgage
Loan that is serviced by a Seller, and (ii) use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide Buyer and Reinsurers with access in the same location to
the Servicing File with respect to each Commercial Mortgage Loan that is
serviced by a third party, in each case of (i) and (ii), to the extent such
Loan Files or Servicing Files are in the possession or control of, or
reasonably available to, a Seller or its Affiliates; _provided_ , that if
Sellers are unable to provide access in a single location to such Loan Files
or Servicing Files in the possession or control of, or reasonably available
to, a Seller or its Affiliates, Sellers shall provide Buyer and Reinsurers
with access to such Loan Files and Servicing Files in a manner that is
reasonable acceptable to Buyer and Reinsurers.

 



 

 **ARTICLE VIII**

 

 **ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS**

 



 

Section 8.1 _Employee Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Comparable Position_.

 



 

(i) _Section 8.1(a)(i) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_ lists all
Business Employees, including Inactive Business Employees, as of the date
hereof, as well as, for each such Person, their title or position, employing
entity, whether such Person is an Offer Employee or an Other Business
Employee, the percentage of business time the Business Employee devotes to
serving the ADA, closed block, and/or executive benefit business segments of
the Business, whether such Person is dedicated to the FIM Life and FIM
Annuities new business operations, work location, full-time or part-time
status, accrued or granted vacation (provided that the accrued or granted
vacation will be included only in Business Disclosure Schedule updates
provided at least thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement), dates of
service, years of credit service, then-current base salary, target annual
incentive percentage, target long-term incentive compensation opportunity,
Seller Equity Award Information, and other compensation or compensatory
entitlements (including under any GWLA Sales Incentive Plan) in effect for the
year in which such Persons Transfer Date (as defined below) occurs
(collectively, the " _Business Employee Information_ "). Prior to the Closing
(or, with respect to any Inactive Business Employee or Retained Employee,
prior to the applicable Transfer Date), GWLA shall update _Section 8.1(a)(i)
of the Business Disclosure Schedule_ to add any individuals who become
Business Employees after the date hereof, to remove any individuals who have
ceased to be Business Employees after the date hereof, to reflect any changes
in Inactive Business Employees, or to reflect any changes in

 



     

 

 



 

the Business Employee Information (provided that Seller Equity Award
Information need only be included in _Section 8.1(a)(i) of the Business
Disclosure Schedule_ as of the date hereof, the first updated version
following the normally scheduled grants in March 2019 and the final updated
version), and shall promptly deliver such updated list to Buyer; _provided_ ,
that (x) GWLA shall deliver an updated version of _Section 8.1(a)(i) of the
Business Disclosure Schedule_ to Buyer on a monthly basis following the date
hereof until the Closing (or, with respect to any Inactive Business Employee
or Retained Employee, prior to the applicable Transfer Date) (y) GWLA shall
deliver a final version of _Section 8.1(a)(i) of the Business Disclosure
Schedule_ not less than thirty (30) Business Days prior to the Closing (or,
with respect to any Inactive Business Employee or Retained Employee, prior to
the applicable Transfer Date), and (z) with respect to any Inactive Business
Employee or Retained Employee whose Transfer Date will occur after the Closing
Date, neither Sellers nor the GWLA Subsidiaries shall take any actions that
would have been prohibited under _Section 7.1(a)_ of this Agreement without
the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 



 

(ii) Within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement or, if later,
within thirty (30) days of the date GWLA reports to Buyer that an individual
has become a Business Employee and is an Offer Employee (but not later than
three (3) days prior to the Closing Date), subject to _Section 8.1(d)_
hereof, Buyer or its Affiliates shall extend to each Offer Employee who is not
an Inactive Business Employee a written offer of employment, effective as of
the Closing Date, that constitutes a Comparable Position with Buyer or its
Affiliates (such offer, an " _Offer of Employment_ "). For the ninety (90)
days immediately following the date hereof, Sellers shall, and shall cause
their Affiliates to, provide to Buyer and its Representatives, upon the
request of Buyer, access to those Business Employees who are not the Offer
Employees (the " _Other Business Employees_ ") and job descriptions, where
such job description is available, for such Other Business Employees, to
identify and evaluate which, if any, Other Business Employees to whom an Offer
of Employment will be made by Buyer in its sole discretion. No later than
ninety (90) days following the date hereof (such date being the " _Notice
Date_ "), Buyer shall provide Sellers with a written notice of the Other
Business Employees, if any, to whom it will extend an Offer of Employment
(each such Other Business Employee being, a " _Selected Other Business
Employee_ "). Within ten (10) Business Days following the Notice Date, Buyer
or its Affiliates shall extend to each such Selected Other Business Employee
who is not an Inactive Business Employee an Offer of Employment. Such Offer of
Employment shall be contingent on the applicable Offer Employee or Selected
Other Business Employee remaining continuously and actively employed by GWLA
or the applicable GWLA Subsidiary through the Transfer Date (as defined
below), or with respect to Retained Employees, through the Service Termination
Date (as defined below). For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent an Offer
Employee or Selected Other Business Employee becomes an Inactive Business
Employee prior to his or her Transfer Date, such Offer Employee or Selected
Other Business Employee shall be treated as an Inactive Business Employee in a
manner consistent with _Section 8.1(a)(v)_ hereof. Buyer shall provide GWLA
with forms of the documents that Buyer intends to use to make Offers of
Employment prior to the time that such Offers of Employment are made. GWLA
shall, and shall cause GWLA Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with Buyer
and its Affiliates and reasonably

 



      

 

 



 

assist Buyer and its Affiliates in its efforts to extend Offers of Employment
to the Business Employees pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_. Buyer shall
reimburse Sellers for the GWLA Severance Benefits provided to any Other
Business Employee who does not receive an Offer of Employment, other than
those Other Business Employees identified as dedicated to the FIM Life and FIM
Annuities new business operations on _Section 8.1(a)(i) of the Business
Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

(iii) Except as set forth below with respect to Inactive Business Employees
and Retained Employees, the employment relationship of each Offer Employee and
Selected Other Business Employee with GWLA or the applicable GWLA Subsidiary
shall terminate effective as of the Closing. Each Offer Employee and Selected
Other Business Employee who has accepted Buyers Offer of Employment and who
commences employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer on the Closing Date,
or, in the case of Inactive Business Employees or Retained Employees, within
the time period described in _Section 8.1(a)(iv)_ or _(v)_ , as applicable,
shall be a " _Transferred Employee_ " for all purposes of this Agreement. To
the extent any Offer Employee and Selected Other Business Employee to whom an
Offer of Employment has been made by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.1(a)_
does not accept such Offer of Employment, such employees shall not be eligible
to receive the GWLA Severance Benefit. Effective as of the Transfer Date, the
Transferred Employees shall cease participation in the Employee Benefit Plans.
Except as expressly provided in this _Section 8.1_, GWLA or a GWLA Subsidiary
shall remain liable for all eligible claims for benefits under the Employee
Benefit Plans that are incurred by the Transferred Employees prior to the
Transfer Date, and Buyer or one of its Affiliates shall be liable for any such
claims incurred on or after the Transfer Date. For purposes of this Agreement,
claims shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (x) life, accidental death
and dismemberment, disability, and workers compensation insurance benefits,
on the event giving rise to such benefits; and (y) medical, vision, dental,
and prescription drug benefits, on the date the applicable services, materials
or supplies were provided. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
providing COBRA coverage for Transferred Employees and their respective
covered dependents whose qualifying events (as defined in Code Section 4980B)
occur on or after the Transfer Date, and GWLA or a GWLA Subsidiary shall be
responsible for providing COBRA coverage, for all Business Employees who do
not become Transferred Employees and their respective covered dependents whose
qualifying events (as defined in Code Section 4980B) occur prior to the
Transfer Date.

 



 

(iv) GWLA or a GWLA Subsidiary shall continue to employ each Business Employee
listed on _Section 8.1(a)(iv) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_ (each, a "
_Retained Employee_ ") until the earlier of (1) the expiration of the Service
Period (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) or (2) the date on
which the Service (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement) which such
Retained Employee provides is terminated pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement or such Retained Employees services are otherwise no longer
required by Sellers (such earlier date, the " _Service Termination Date_ ").
During the ninety (90) day period following the date of this Agreement,
Sellers may identify up to ten (10) additional Business Employees as Retained
Employees on _Section 8.1(a)(iv) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_ with
the written approval of Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, and
up to ten (10) additional Business Employees as Retained Employees on _Section
8.1(a)(iv) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_

 



     

 

 



 

with the written approval of Buyer. Upon the Service Termination Date, Sellers
shall notify Buyer in writing of the Service Termination Date and identify in
such notice the Retained Employee(s) who are impacted by the occurrence of
such Service Termination Date. A Retained Employee who has accepted Buyers
Offer of Employment will become a Transferred Employee when the Retained
Employee commences employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer; provided
however, that a Retained Employee who has accepted Buyers Offer of Employment
shall become a Transferred Employee not later than five (5) business days
following the Service Termination Date.

 



 

(v) Inactive Business Employees shall remain employed by GWLA or a GWLA
Subsidiary, as the case may be, until the earlier of (1) the Inactive Business
Employees Transfer Date and (2) the date on which the Inactive Business
Employees employment with GWLA or a GWLA Subsidiary is terminated. If an
Inactive Business Employee returns to work within six (6) months of the
Closing Date (or such later date as protected under federal law for an
Inactive Business Employee on a military leave of absence), subject to
_Section 8.1(d)_ hereof, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer shall extend an Offer
of Employment to the Inactive Business Employee who is an Offer Employee
within five (5) Business Days of such Inactive Business Employees returning
to active status. With respect to any Inactive Business Employee who returns
to work within six (6) months of the Closing Date (or such later date as
protected under federal law for an Inactive Business Employee on a military
leave of absence) and who is not an Offer Employee, during the ten (10) day
period immediately following such Inactive Business Employees returning to
active status, Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer may, but shall not be required
to, extend an Offer of Employment to such Inactive Business Employee. An
Inactive Business Employee will become a Transferred Employee when the
Inactive Business Employee accepts Buyers Offer of Employment, and commences
employment with Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer; provided however, that an
Inactive Business Employee who has accepted Buyers Offer of Employment shall
become a Transferred Employee not later than five (5) business days following
the date on which such Offer of Employment is accepted. Unless and until an
Inactive Business Employee becomes a Transferred Employee, GWLA or a GWLA
Subsidiary shall remain responsible for any Liabilities relating to or arising
out of such Inactive Business Employees employment or termination of
employment with GWLA or a GWLA Subsidiary.

 



 

(vi) The date on which a Business Employee commences employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates will be referred to as the " _Transfer Date_ " which, for
purposes of clarification, means (x) the Closing Date for all Business
Employees other than Inactive Business Employees and Retained Employees, and
(y) for any Inactive Business Employee or Retained Employees, the date such
Inactive Business Employee or Retained Employee becomes a Transferred
Employee.

 



 

(vii) Within thirty (30) days of the date of this Agreement, GWLA shall
provide a list of each individual engaged through temporary staffing agencies
who provides substantially all of their services to the Business, including,
for each such Person, their employment location, the applicable employing
agency, billing rate, and scope and terms of engagement. For purposes of this
_Section 8.1(a)(vii)_, an individual is deemed to provide "substantially all
of their services to the Business" if such individual dedicates at least
eighty percent (80%) of his or her business

 



     

 

 



 

time to serving the Business during which he or she provides services to GWLA
or any GWLA Subsidiary.

 



 

(b) _Employee Communications_. During the period from the date hereof through
the relevant Transfer Date, Buyer and GWLA will reasonably cooperate to
communicate to the Business Employees the details of the proposed terms and
conditions of their employment with Buyer or its Affiliates. All
communications during such period between Buyer or its Affiliates and the
Business Employees with respect to employment, compensation or benefits
matters addressed in this Agreement or related, directly or indirectly, to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be subject to GWLAs
reasonable prior approval, and all communications during such period between
Sellers or GWLA Subsidiaries and the Business Employees pertaining to post-
Transfer Date employment, compensation or benefits matters or otherwise
related to the Business Employees relationship with Buyer or its Affiliates
shall be subject to Buyers reasonable prior approval.

 



 

(c) _Maintenance of Terms_. For a period of twelve (12) months following a
Transferred Employees Transfer Date (or until the date on which such
Transferred Employees employment with Buyer and its Affiliates terminates, if
earlier), Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, provide such
Transferred Employee with the following:

 



 

(i) an aggregate amount of total target compensation opportunity (which, for
purposes of this _Section 8.1(c)(i)_, includes a Transferred Employees
annual base salary or wages, plus the amount of annual incentive opportunity,
sales incentive opportunity, and long-term incentive opportunity, as
applicable, that such Transferred Employee is eligible to receive assuming
achievement of target levels of performance) that is at least as favorable as
the aggregate amount of such total target compensation opportunity provided to
the Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Employees Transfer Date,
which amount may be provided by Buyer in a form, and pursuant to plans and
programs, as determined by Buyer in its discretion; provided that the
Transferred Employees annual base salary and wages shall be no less than such
Transferred Employees annual base salary and wages in effect immediately
prior to the Transferred Employees Transfer Date;

 



 

(ii) employment at the same location, employment within twenty-five (25) miles
of the location at which such Transferred Employee is principally employed as
of the Transfer Date, employment at the Transferred Employees home, or
employment at a different location with the Transferred Employees consent;

 



 

(iii) in the event that (a) the employment of any Transferred Employee is
terminated for any reason other than cause, (b) any Transferred Employee
resigns as a result of a requirement to relocate, without the Transferred
Employees consent, to more than twenty-five (25) miles from the location at
which such Transferred Employee is principally employed immediately prior to
the Transfer Date, other than a requirement to work from the Transferred
Employees home, or (c) any Transferred Employee resigns within thirty (30)
days of a reduction in the Transferred Employees annual rate of salary and
wages, the (x) cash payments that would be made under the applicable GWLA
Severance Benefit and (y) benefits that are substantially comparable to the
non-cash severance and outplacement benefits under the applicable GWLA
Severance Benefit, taking into account the Transferred Employees length of
service with GWLA and its

 



     

 

 



 

Affiliates and Buyer and its Affiliates, subject to such Transferred
Employees execution and non-revocation of a waiver and general release of
claims; and

 



 

(iv) participation in employee benefit plans, policies, practices or
agreements (other than those addressed separately in this _Section 8.1(c)_)
that are being provided to similarly-situated employees of the Buyer or its
Affiliates (including any such plans in which newly hired employees are not
eligible to participate).

 



 

(d) _401(k) Plan Profit-Sharing Contribution_. Buyer shall, or shall cause an
Affiliate to, pay to each Transferred Employee a cash payment equal to the
discretionary profit-sharing contribution that the Transferred Employee would
have received under the Sellers 401(k) profit-sharing plan for the 2019 plan
year had the plan not required employment on the last day of the 2019 plan
year as a condition of receiving the contribution. Such cash payment shall
only be made to Transferred Employees who are employed on the date of such
payment, and such payment shall be made no later than March 31, 2020. GWLA
shall provide Buyer with the calculation of such cash payment for each
Transferred Employee no later than March 1, 2020. GWLA shall reimburse Buyer
for such cash payment no later than March 31, 2020, as determined in the
manner specified in _Section 8.1(i)_.

 



 

(e) _Work Permits_. Buyer shall use, or cause its Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to sponsor, or transfer sponsorship of, the
work permits for all Transferred Employees who are foreign nationals, and
agrees to so sponsor, or cause its Affiliates to so sponsor, such foreign
national Transferred Employees on and after the Closing; _provided_ , that
each such foreign national Transferred Employees name, position, country of
citizenship and type of work permit are disclosed on _Section 8.1(e) of the
Business Disclosure Schedule_. GWLA shall and shall cause the GWLA
Subsidiaries to cooperate as necessary to effect Buyers or its Affiliates
sponsorship or transfer of sponsorship of all such foreign national
Transferred Employees. To the extent that it is not possible to effect Buyers
or its Affiliates sponsorship or transfer of sponsorship of any foreign
national Business Employee, neither Buyer nor its Affiliates will be obligated
to make an Offer of Employment to such Person, and such Person shall not
become a Transferred Employee.

 



 

(f) _Employee Benefits_. Buyer and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to waive or cause to be waived, any waiting period,
probationary period, pre-existing condition exclusion, evidence of
insurability requirement, or similar condition with respect to initial
participation under any plan, program, or arrangement established, maintained,
or contributed to by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to provide health
insurance, life insurance, or disability benefits with respect to each
Transferred Employee who has, prior to the Transfer Date, satisfied, under
GWLAs comparable plans, the comparable eligibility, insurability or other
requirements referred to in this sentence. For the 2019 plan year, Buyer and
its Affiliates shall waive, or shall cause to be waived, any restrictions or
limitations related to the coverage of spouses or domestic partners under the
health or medical plans of the Buyer and its Affiliates, to the extent a
similar restriction or limitation did not exist under GWLAs comparable health
or medical plans immediately prior to the Transfer Date. Buyer and its
Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize or cause to
be recognized the dollar amount of all co-insurance, deductibles and similar
expenses incurred by each Transferred Employee (and his or her eligible
dependents) during the calendar year in which the Transfer Date occurs for
purposes of satisfying such years deductible and co-payment limitations under
the relevant welfare benefit plans in which each Transferred Employee will be
eligible to participate from and after the Transfer Date, subject to the
provision of such information by GWLA to the plan administrator or the third-
party administrator of the applicable welfare benefit plan of Buyer not later
than thirty (30) days following the applicable Transfer Date. Each Transferred
Employee who is covered by a health or medical plan of Buyer or its Affiliates
immediately following the Transfer Date shall receive the applicable wellness
credit under such plan for the portion of the 2019 plan year following such
Transferred Employees Transfer Date, provided that GWLA provides a
certification that such Transferred

 



     

 

 



 

Employee has completed the appropriate requirements necessary to receive the
2019 wellness credit under a comparable health or medical plan of GWLA. Each
Transferred Employee shall, for purposes of determining such Transferred
Employees eligibility to participate in, vesting and calculating the benefit
accrual, determining paid time off and calculating severance under all
employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates,
be credited with the service of such Transferred Employee with GWLA or its
Affiliates, to the same extent as if such service had been performed for Buyer
or any of its Affiliates, except (i) to the extent that such credit would
result in duplication of benefits, (ii) to the extent that such credit is not
recognized by Buyer or its Affiliates with respect to similarly situated
employees, (iii) for purposes of benefit accrual under any qualified
retirement or defined benefit pension plan, or (iv) to the extent that such
credit was not recognized under a similar plan maintained by Sellers or the
GWLA Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Transfer Date. In addition, Buyer
shall, or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates to:

 



 

(i) cause the defined contribution plan(s) maintained by Buyer or its
Affiliates to accept a direct rollover of the account balance, including up to
three (3) promissory notes evidencing outstanding loans but excluding
securities, of any Transferred Employee under a 401(k) plan of GWLA that such
Transferred Employee elects to make as a direct rollover, and, to the extent
necessary, amend such defined contribution plan(s) prior to the Closing in
order to carry out the intent of this _Section 8.1(f)_, subject to Buyers
receipt from GWLA of its most recent determination letter from the IRS that
the applicable 401(k) plan is qualified under Sections 401(a) and 401(k) of
the Code, and such other information as Buyer may reasonably request; and

 



 

(ii) reimburse Transferred Employees for any unreimbursed expenses in respect
of education courses for which such Transferred Employees registered prior to
the Transfer Date, to the extent that GWLAs policies would provide for such
reimbursement if such Transferred Employees had continued to be employed by
GWLA or a GWLA Subsidiary.

 



 

(g) _Paid Time Off_. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, and except as
would result in duplication of benefits, for the remainder of the 2019
calendar year, Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to (i) recognize any
unused paid time off accrued by or granted to such Transferred Employee
pursuant to the applicable paid time off plan, policy or agreement of GWLA
covering such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Transfer Date, and
(ii) to the extent applicable to such Transferred Employee, cause such
Transferred Employee to continue to accrue paid time off that would have
accrued pursuant to the applicable paid time off plan, policy, or agreement of
GWLA covering such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Transfer
Date. On or prior to the Transfer Date, GWLA shall provide Buyer with a
schedule of the paid time off accruals or entitlements that will be
transferred or recognized in accordance with this _Section 8.1(g)_.
Commencing with the calendar year 2020, Transferred Employees shall receive
paid time off in accordance with the plans, policies, and agreements of Buyer
and its Affiliates that are applicable to similarly-situated employees of
Buyer and its Affiliates, including the ability to carry over unused 2019
calendar year paid time off pursuant to the applicable paid time off plans,
policies, and agreements of Buyer and its Affiliates.

 



 

(h) _Incentive Plans_.

 



 

(i) Upon the Closing (or, with respect to any Inactive Business Employee or
Retained Employee, upon the applicable Transfer Date), in respect of the pre-
Transfer Date portion of the calendar year in which the applicable Transfer
Date occurs, GWLA shall pay, or cause its Affiliates to pay, to each
Transferred Employee the pro-rata

 



     

 

 



 

portion of his or her target annual bonus under GWLAs annual bonus plans
(excluding GWLA Sales Incentive Plans), based on each Transferred Employees
target bonus and pay immediately prior to the Transfer Date.

 



 

(ii) GWLA and its Affiliates shall take any and all action necessary to cause
the Transferred Employees unvested equity awards to vest immediately prior to
the Transfer Date and shall make all payments necessary to satisfy such
unvested equity awards to the Transferred Employees in accordance with the
terms of GWLAs and its Affiliates applicable long-term incentive plans.

 



 

(iii) GWLA shall direct Buyer or one of its Affiliates to pay, and Buyer shall
pay or cause its Affiliates to pay, no later than March 15, 2020, any amounts
due under any GWLA Sales Incentive Plan (including draws and any guaranteed
amounts promised to a Transferred Employee, but not Offer Letter Guaranteed
Amounts) for the 2019 calendar year that have not been satisfied as of the
Transfer Date. GWLA shall reimburse Buyer for such payment. Buyer or one of
its Affiliates shall be responsible for any Offer Letter Guaranteed Amounts
that have not yet been paid as of the Transfer Date, in accordance with GWLAs
past payment practices.

 



 

(i) Any reimbursements made by GWLA or Buyer pursuant to this _Section 8.1_
shall be inclusive of the employer portion of any employment, payroll, social
security or other Taxes.

 



 

(j) Buyer and GWLA shall, Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to, and GWLA shall
cause the GWLA Subsidiaries to, cooperate as appropriate to carry out the
provisions of this _Section 8.1_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, GWLA shall promptly
provide Buyer with such information and documents relating to the plans,
employee policies, payroll data, service crediting data and Business Records
related to the Transferred Employees as may reasonably be requested by Buyer
or its Affiliates and in accordance with _Section 8.10_, to facilitate the
transition of the Transferred Employees to payroll and employee benefit plans
or programs of Buyer or its Affiliates; provided, however, that any Business
Records involving I-9 documentation will not be disclosed until the Transfer
Date, and any Business Records involving performance reviews, corrective
action documentation, and Family and Medical Leave Act documentation with
respect to any Transferred Employee will be disclosed not later than fifteen
(15) days following the Transfer Date. Buyer shall ensure that the information
and documents specified in the preceding sentence, as well as the Business
Records related to the Business Employees provided pursuant to _Section
8.10_, shall be kept confidential and shall be used by Buyer in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice, in connection with the
employment of the Business Employees, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold
harmless GWLA and its Affiliates with respect to any Losses incurred by GWLA
or its Affiliates related to any alleged or actual violation of Applicable Law
with respect to Buyers termination or other employment related decisions
based on the information and documents specified in the preceding sentence or
the Business Records related to the Business Employees, other than payroll
data, service crediting data, and Business Records involving performance goals
and job descriptions.

 



 

(k) _No Amendment of Plans_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, constitute
the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any employee benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of, or subject to, ERISA), and no Person
participating in any such employee benefit plan maintained by either GWLA or
its Affiliates or Buyer or its Affiliates, shall have any claim or cause of
action, under ERISA or otherwise, in respect of any provision of this
Agreement as it relates to any such employee benefit plan or otherwise. No
provision of this Agreement is intended to, or does, prevent Buyer or its
Affiliates from amending or terminating any

 



     

 

 



 

of their employee benefit plans in accordance with their terms, nor is any
provision of this Agreement intended to create any third-party beneficiary
rights in any employee of Sellers or the GWLA Subsidiaries, including any
Business Employee, or their respective beneficiaries and dependents, with
respect to their compensation, benefits and/or terms and conditions of
employment.

 



 

Section 8.2 _Insurance; Risk of Loss_. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that,
effective at the time of the Closing, the Business will cease to be insured by
any insurance policies of any Seller or its Affiliates.

 



 

Section 8.3 _Use of Sellers  Trademarks; Corporate Names_.

 



 

(a) Buyer, for itself and its Affiliates, acknowledges and agrees that, other
than the Transferred Owned Intellectual Property and other than as expressly
contemplated in the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer is not purchasing, acquiring
or otherwise obtaining any right, title or interest in or to any Intellectual
Property Rights of any Seller or its Affiliates, including the names "Great-
West", "Canada Life" and any registered or pending Trademarks of any Seller
and its Affiliates as of the date hereof, or any unregistered Trademarks of
any Seller or its Affiliates of which Buyer and its Affiliates have knowledge
or which are licensed under the Trademark License Agreement, and any visual
representations thereof, monograms, tag-lines, designs, symbols, images,
colors and characters, and any variation of the foregoing in this sentence and
that is confusingly similar in sound or appearance to any of the foregoing
(including all registrations and applications relating thereto) (collectively,
the " _Seller Name and Marks_ "), and, except as otherwise expressly provided
in any Ancillary Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall have
any rights in the Seller Name and Marks, and neither Buyer nor any of its
Affiliates shall contest the ownership or validity of any rights of a Seller
or any of its Affiliates in or to the Seller Name and Marks.

 



 

(b) Buyer agrees that, except (i) as otherwise expressly provided in any
Ancillary Agreement, (ii) in connection with historical references to the
Business or (iii) for internal business purpose, records and other historical
archived documents, or (iv) to the extent required by or permitted as fair use
under Applicable Law, following the Closing Date, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall cease and discontinue all uses of the Seller Name and Marks, either
alone or in combination with other words and all marks, trade dress, logos,
monograms and other source identifiers similar to any of the foregoing or
embodying any of the foregoing alone or in combination with other words,
including other words in compliance with _Section 8.3(c)_.

 



 

(c) In accordance with the terms of the Ancillary Agreements and on the

re-label, destroy, delete or exhaust all materials bearing the Seller Name and
Marks, including signage, advertising, promotional materials, Software,
packaging, inventory, electronic materials, collateral goods, stationery,
business cards, web sites and other materials (except to the extent any such
materials must be retained to comply with Applicable Laws or document
retention notices issued by any Governmental Body), and (ii) thereafter, send
a written statement to Sellers verifying that it has re-labeled, destroyed,
deleted or exhausted all materials bearing the Seller Name and Marks. Buyer,
for itself and its Affiliates, agrees that after the Closing Date Buyer and
its Affiliates will not expressly, or by implication, do business as or
represent themselves as any Seller or an Affiliate of any Seller.

obligations under this _Section 8.3_, Sellers and their Affiliates may
proceed against it in law or in equity for such damages or other relief as a
court may deem appropriate. Buyer acknowledges that a violation of this
_Section 8.3_ may cause Sellers and their Affiliates irreparable harm, which
may not be adequately compensated for by money damages. Buyer therefore agrees
that in the event of any actual or threatened violation of this _Section
8.3_, Sellers and any of their Affiliates shall be entitled, in addition to
other remedies that they may

 



     

 

 



 

have, to seek a temporary restraining order and to seek preliminary and final

Sellers shall not, and GWLA shall cause the GWLA Subsidiaries not to, and
cause their respective Affiliates not to, without Buyers prior written
consent, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment of, employ, hire or

(1) any Business Employee to whom Buyer extended an Offer of Employment or any
Transferred Employee or (2) any employee of Buyer or its Affiliates set forth
on _Section 8.4(a) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule_, in each case, unless
such Person has not been employed by Buyer or its Affiliates for a period of
at least three (3) months prior to such solicitation or such Persons
employment has been terminated by Buyer or its Affiliates (independent of any
action of Sellers or the GWLA Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that (1) except as
set forth in subclause (2) below, this _Section 8.4(a)_ shall not prohibit
Sellers or their Affiliates from making general solicitations for employment
or independent contractor relationships through advertisements not directed at
Buyer, its Affiliates or any such Person or otherwise employing or hiring any
Person who contacts Sellers or any of their Affiliates on his or her own
initiative without direct solicitation or as a result of such advertisements,
and (2) notwithstanding the foregoing, until the expiration of the Service
Period (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement), the applicable
provisions of this _Section 8.4(a)_ shall continue to apply to any
Transferred Employee who responds to any such general solicitation. Buyer
shall provide Sellers with a weekly report that lists the Transferred
Employees who have left employment during that week, and whether each such
Transferred Employees employment has been terminated by Buyer or its
Affiliates.

 



 

(b) During the twenty-four (24) month period following the Closing Date,
except as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, without
Sellers prior written consent, directly or indirectly, solicit the employment
of, employ, hire or enter into an independent contractor, agency or consulting
relationship with any employee of a Seller or its Affiliates set forth on
_Section 8.4(b) of the Business Disclosure Schedule_, unless such Person has
not been employed by a Seller or its Affiliates for a period of at least three
(3) months prior to such solicitation or such Persons employment has been
terminated by a Seller or its Affiliates (independent of any action of Buyer
or its Affiliates) at least three (3) months prior to such solicitation;
_provided_ , that this _Section 8.4(b)_ shall not prohibit Buyer or its
Affiliates from making general solicitations for employment or independent
contractor relationships through advertisements not directed at Sellers, their
Affiliates or any such Person or otherwise employing or hiring or entering
into an independent contractor relationship with any Person who contacts Buyer
or any of its Affiliates on his or her own initiative without direct
solicitation or as a result of such advertisements.

 



 

(c) The Parties acknowledge that the covenants set forth in this _Section
8.4_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for these
covenants, the Parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The Parties
to this Agreement acknowledge that this _Section 8.4_ constitutes an
independent covenant and shall not be affected by performance or
nonperformance of any other provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement by the Parties.

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the type and periods of restriction imposed
in the provisions of this _Section 8.4_ are fair and reasonable and are
reasonably required for the protection of the Parties. If any of the
restrictions or covenants in this _Section 8.4_ are hereafter construed to be
invalid or unenforceable, the same shall not affect the remainder of the
covenant or covenants, which shall be given full effect,

 



     

 

 



 

without regard to the invalid portions. If any of the restrictions or
covenants contained in this _Section 8.4_, or any portion thereof, are deemed
to be unenforceable because such covenant or restriction is held to cover a
geographic area or to be of such duration as is not permitted under Applicable
Law, the Parties agree that the court making such determination shall have the
power to reduce the duration and/or areas of such provision and, in its
reduced form, said provision shall then be enforceable.

 



 

(e) Each Party recognizes that its obligations under this _Section 8.4_ are
special, unique and extraordinary in character and that, in the event of any
actual violation of any provision of this _Section 8.4_, the other Party
shall be entitled to institute and prosecute proceedings in any court of
competent jurisdiction, either in law or in equity, to obtain damages for any
actual violation, enforce the specific performance and/or enjoin any actions
in violation of this _Section 8.4_

 



 

Section 8.5 _Principal Underwriter_. At the end of the term specified in the
Transition Services Agreement with respect to the functions described in this
_Section 8.5_ (the " _PU Transition Date_ "), in accordance with Applicable
Law and subject to the receipt of any required Governmental Consents, Seller
shall appoint a duly licensed Affiliate of Buyer, designated in writing by
Buyer (the " _Buyer BD_ "), to be the principal underwriter (as such term is
used in the 1940 Act), or primary distributor (or similar function) with
respect to private placements (such functions, as applicable, the "
_Securities Distribution Functions_ "), as appropriate, for the Covered
Insurance Policies that are securities, effective as of the PU Transition
Date, and Buyer shall cause the Buyer BD to assume the Securities Distribution
Functions of any Affiliate of Sellers who performs the Securities Distribution
Functions for such Covered Insurance Policies (each, an " _Existing Principal
Underwriter_ "), to the extent related to such Covered Insurance Policies.
Each Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in connection with the appointment and
assumption of the Securities Distribution Functions, and shall provide any
information requested by Buyer that is reasonably necessary for Buyer to (a)
determine whether a continuing membership application (" _CMA_ ") is necessary
under NASD Rule 1017 in order for Buyer BD to assume the Securities
Distribution Functions and (b) if such a CMA is necessary, prepare such CMA
and respond to requests from FINRA in connection therewith. If a CMA is
necessary, Buyer shall prepare and file such CMA as promptly as practicable in
order to effect the appointment and assumption of the Securities Distribution
Functions by the PU Transition Date. Buyer shall cooperate with Sellers in
connection with the appointment and assumption of the Securities Distribution
Functions, and shall provide any information requested by a Seller that is
reasonably necessary for Sellers to (x) determine the form of SEC filing that
will be needed for Buyer BD to assume the Securities Distribution Functions,
(y) prepare such SEC filing or respond to requests from the SEC in connection
therewith and (z) make amendments to private placement memoranda in connection
with the appointment and assumption contemplated by this _Section 8.5_. In
connection with the foregoing, not later than the PU Transition Date, each
Seller shall negotiate and enter into a principal underwriting agreement or a
private placement agreement, each as applicable, with the Buyer BD on
reasonable terms, taking into consideration the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to transition the counterparties to the Mutual Fund
Agreements and Distribution Agreements to which an Existing Principal
Underwriter is a party, to the extent relating to the Covered Insurance
Policies, to a relationship with Buyer BD, including, if such agreements are
freely assignable, assignment to the Buyer BD of each Existing Principal
Underwriters rights and obligations thereunder.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) Upon Closing, the Confidentiality Agreements shall terminate. If this
Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing for any reason, the
Confidentiality Agreements shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

 



 

(b) Following the Closing, Buyer shall hold and cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to keep confidential, unless reasonably required by a

Confidential Information. To the extent Buyer or its Affiliates or
Representatives is compelled by a Governmental Body or Applicable Law (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such
information, Buyer will provide Sellers with notice of such request or
requirement as promptly as practicable (unless not permitted by Applicable
Law) so that Sellers may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with this _Section 8.6(b)_. Buyer shall cooperate
reasonably with Sellers in connection with Sellers reasonable efforts to seek
such an order or remedy. If Sellers do not obtain such protective order or
other remedy, or Sellers waive Buyers compliance with the provisions of this

confidential information that is reasonably required, and will exercise
reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such disclosed information.

Confidential Information. To the extent a Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives is compelled by a Governmental Body or Applicable Law (by oral
questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any such
information, Sellers will provide Buyer with notice of such request or
requirement as promptly as practicable (unless not permitted by Applicable
Law) so that Buyer may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy
and/or waive compliance with this _Section 8.6(c)_. Each Seller shall
cooperate reasonably with Buyer in connection with Buyers reasonable efforts
to seek such an order or remedy. If Buyer does not obtain such protective
order or other remedy, or Buyer waives any Sellers compliance with the
provisions of this _Section 8.6(c)_, such Seller will furnish only that
portion of the applicable confidential information that is reasonably
required, and will exercise reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such disclosed information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 8.6(c)_, Sellers
and their Affiliates may (without complying with the notice and cooperation
requirements in this _Section 8.6(c)_) disclose the Business Records (i) to
regulatory authorities having supervisory jurisdiction over Sellers or their
Affiliates during the course of any routine audit or routine examination, (ii)
to any Person reasonably requesting such Business Records pursuant to such
Persons rights under a Covered Insurance Policy, (iii) to the extent
reasonably required in the performance of any obligations under the Ancillary
Agreements and (iv) to any Person if Reinsurers are no longer administrating
the Covered Insurance Policies pursuant to the Administrative Services
Agreements.

 



 

(d) " _Seller Confidential Information_ " means (i) confidential information

Liability), except to the extent such information can be shown to have been
(x) previously known by Buyer, its Affiliates or its Representatives or
independently developed by Buyer, its Affiliates or its Representatives
without reference to the Seller Confidential Information, (y) in the public
domain through no fault of Buyer, its Affiliates or its Representatives, or
(z) later lawfully acquired from other sources by Buyer or its
Representatives; _provided_ that such source is not, to such partys
knowledge, bound by a confidentiality agreement with the other party or its
Representatives and is not, to such partys knowledge, otherwise prohibited
from transmitting the information to such party by a contractual, legal or
fiduciary obligation.

 



 

(e) " _Buyer Confidential Information_ " means (i) confidential information
that is furnished by or on behalf of Buyer or its Representatives to a Seller,
its Affiliates or Representatives prior to the Closing

reasonable efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to
do, or cause to be done, and to cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law or otherwise, to
cause the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied and to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements,
including to negotiate reasonably and in good faith to finalize the terms of
any such Ancillary Agreement to the extent not attached as an Exhibit to this
Agreement, to the extent that they remain subject to revision as contemplated

extent that they are to be negotiated based on term sheets attached as
Exhibits to this Agreement, as promptly as practicable.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 7.4(b)(ii)_ and _Section 7.5_, from and after the

carry out the provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and
give effect to the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 



 

(c) If, following the Closing and during the period of the Transition Services
Agreement, any Acquired Asset (other than Business Records which are governed
by _Section 8.10_) is found to have been retained by Sellers or any of the
GWLA Subsidiaries in error, Sellers shall, or GWLA shall cause the applicable
GWLA Subsidiary to transfer, at no cost to Buyer, such right, property or

Section 8.10 _Transfer and Maintenance of Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) All Business Records shall be transferred to Buyer as provided in the
Transition Services Agreement; _provided_ that such Business Records shall (A)
exclude Business Records that are subject to any attorney-client privilege,
the work product immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine,
except as provided below and (B) not be required to be transferred to Buyer to
the extent that transferring such Business Records to Buyer would contravene
any Applicable Law, Court Order, Regulatory Agreement, fiduciary duty or
Contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to any non-affiliated Person
as of the date hereof (including any confidentiality agreement to which a
Seller or any of its Affiliates is a party as of the date hereof), it being
understood that each Seller shall reasonably cooperate and use commercially
reasonable efforts in connection with any requests for waivers that would
enable the otherwise required transfer to Buyer to occur without so
contravening such Applicable Law, Court Order, duty, Contract or obligation,
including by entering into a customary joint defense agreement or common
interest agreement with Buyer. Originals or copies of the Business Records
may be retained by Sellers or their Affiliates for recordkeeping, legal or
compliance purposes. Notwithstanding (A) above, the Parties acknowledge and
agree that for any legal opinion or similar document that relates primarily or
exclusively to the Covered Insurance Policies, the Parties assert a joint and
common interest that is intended to preserve the legal privilege or immunity
concerning such opinions or documents and the Parties will take all
commercially reasonable actions requested by the other Party to preserve such
legal privilege or immunity. If Buyer requests delivery of any legal opinion
or similar document, the applicable Seller shall deliver the requested legal
opinion or similar document to Buyer provided that the applicable Seller is
able to do so without waiving attorney-client privilege, the work product
immunity or any other legal privilege or similar doctrine, including through a
joint or common interest that would preserve such legal privilege.

 



 

(b) After the Closing, each Seller shall, Buyer shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to, and GWLA shall cause the GWLA Subsidiaries to, preserve, until
such date as may be required by the standard document retention policies of
the Person required to preserve the relevant records (or such later date as
may be required by Applicable Law), all pre-Closing Date records to the extent
related to the Business possessed or to be possessed by such Person. During
such period, upon any reasonable request from a Party or its Representatives,
the Party holding such records shall (i) provide to the requesting Party or
its Representatives reasonable access to such records during normal business
hours; _provided_ , that such access shall not unreasonably interfere with the
conduct of the business of the Party holding such records, and (ii) permit the
requesting Party or its Representatives to make copies of such records, in
each case, at no cost to the requesting Party or its Representatives (other
than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses). Nothing herein shall require any
Party to (i) disclose any information to the other if such disclosure would
jeopardize any attorney-client privilege, the work product immunity or any
other legal privilege or similar doctrine or contravene any Applicable Law,
Court Order, Regulatory Agreement, fiduciary duty or Contract or obligation of
confidentiality owing to any non-affiliated Person (including any
confidentiality agreement to which the disclosing Party or any of its
Affiliates is a party) (it being understood that the disclosing Party shall
cooperate in any commercially reasonable efforts to obtain waivers that would
enable otherwise required disclosure to the requesting Party or its
Representatives to occur without so jeopardizing privilege or contravening
such Applicable Law, Court Order, duty, Contract or obligation), (ii) (except
as provided in _Article XII_) to disclose its Tax records or any personnel or
related records or (iii) with respect to Sellers and their Affiliates, provide
access to or copies of the portion of any books or records that contain
information relating to the Excluded Businesses. Such records may be sought
under this _Section 8.10_ for any reasonable purpose, including to the extent
reasonably required in connection with accounting, litigation, federal
securities disclosure or other similar purpose (other than for purposes
relating to claims between Sellers and Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any and all such records may be destroyed by a Party if such
destroying party sends to the other Party hereto written notice of its intent
to destroy such records, specifying in reasonable detail the contents of the
records to be destroyed; such records may then be

 



     

 

 



 

destroyed after the sixtieth (60th) day following such notice unless the other
Party notifies the destroying Party that such other Party desires to obtain
possession of such records, in which event the destroying Party shall transfer
the records to such requesting Party and such requesting Party shall pay all
reasonable expenses of the destroying Party in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 8.11 _Seller Deletion of Software and Data_. In the event that after
the Closing Buyer becomes aware of any instance of any Software or data in its
possession that is owned by a Seller or any of its Affiliates and that is not
licensed to Buyer, Buyer shall promptly notify Sellers and use commercially
reasonable efforts to delete such instances of the Software or data as soon as
practicable; _provided_ , that Buyer shall not delete any data until at least
five (5) Business Days following such notification, and if within such five
(5) Business Day period a Seller notifies Buyer that such Seller desires to
obtain possession of a copy of such data prior to its deletion, Buyer shall
transfer a copy to such Seller and such Seller shall pay all reasonable
expenses of Buyer in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 8.12 _Seller Affiliated Funds; Investment Advisory Agreement_.

 



 

(a) During the three-year period following the Closing Date, Buyer shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates to, (i) continue to offer the mutual funds
set forth on _Schedule 8.12(a)_ (the " _Seller Affiliated Funds_ ") as an
investment option within the Covered Insurance Policies to the same extent
such Seller Affiliated Funds are offered as an investment option within the
Covered Insurance Policies as of the date hereof and (ii) in connection
therewith, not directly or indirectly target, through any employees (including
the Transferred Employees) or otherwise, any Policy Holder for replacement of
a Seller Affiliated Fund as an investment within such Covered Insurance Policy
with a mutual fund offered by Buyer or its Affiliates or by an organization
with which Buyer or its Affiliates has an arrangement to offer such
organizations mutual funds as investment options in exchange for the payment
to Buyer or its Affiliates of distribution services fees, administrative
services fees, shareholder services fees or other payments.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, notwithstanding any rights or obligations
contained in the Administrative Services Agreements, Buyer shall not, directly
or indirectly, exercise any rights under the Investment Advisory Agreement
between GWLA and GW Capital Management, LLC (" _GWCM_ "), dated September 29,
2003, as amended by the Amendment dated January 3, 2011 (as so amended, the "
_Investment Advisory Agreement_ ") to terminate, non-renew, modify or amend
the Investment Advisory Agreement, or to otherwise remove GWCM as investment
manager or adviser, with respect to any or all of the Separate Accounts
specified on _Schedule 8.12(b)_ (or sub-accounts thereof), unless (i) GWCM
becomes the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency, assignment for the benefit
of creditors, arrangement, reorganization, composition, readjustment,
liquidation, dissolution or other debtor relief proceeding, or if a receiver,
custodian, liquidator, fiscal agent or trustee is appointed it or any of its
assets, in any case, under any Applicable Law, whether now existing or
hereafter enacted, (ii) GWCM is in material breach of the Investment Advisory
Agreement, (iii) GWCM, in its performance under the Investment Advisory
Agreement with respect to such Separate Account or sub-account thereof, over a
trailing three (3) year period as measured at the end of any calendar quarter,
materially underperforms in comparison to the market indices described on
_Schedule 8.12(b)_ ; _provided_ that Buyer has given notice of such

instrument to such Seller, and (b) a Seller or any of its Affiliates receives

Section 8.14 _Division_. At any time following the Closing, upon written
notice to Buyer, any Seller may elect to effect a Division for the purpose of
dividing into two insurance companies, with one resulting insurance company
(the " _Resulting Company_ ") succeeding to only the Reinsured Liabilities,
Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities (and not, for the avoidance of doubt,
any other asset or Liability, including the Excluded Assets and the Excluded
Liabilities) of such Seller, and one or more other resulting insurance
companies succeeding to all other assets and liabilities of such Seller
(including all Governmental Permits of such Seller and including the Excluded
Assets and Excluded Liabilities). In such event, Buyer and Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (i) cooperate in good faith with and assist
each other in developing a Plan of Division, pursuant to which Buyer or a

Resulting Company by the merger of the Resulting Company with and into Buyer
or a Reinsurer, with the merger to occur immediately following the Division
and (ii) effect the Division and subsequent merger promptly following the
approval by the applicable Governmental Body of the Plan of Division and the
receipt of all other applicable regulatory approvals in connection with the
Division and subsequent merger, each of which shall be on terms and conditions
that are reasonably acceptable to Buyer; _provided_ , that neither Buyer nor
any of its Affiliates shall be obligated to accept any such approval that
requires Buyer or any of its Affiliates to take or refrain from taking, or to
agree that it or any of its Affiliates will take or refrain from taking, any
action, including any requirement or commitment to provide capital to the
Resulting Company, that would result in the Resulting Company or Buyer or any
of its Affiliates assuming any asset or Liability other than the Reinsured
Liabilities, Acquired Assets and Assumed Liabilities. Any costs, fees and
expenses (including those reasonably incurred by Buyer or its Affiliates)
associated with the obligations in this _Section 8.14_ shall be borne by
Sellers. For the avoidance of doubt, effecting a Division shall not affect any
of the obligations of the Parties pursuant to _Article XI_ or otherwise cause
either party to assume any Liability that is the responsibility of another
Party under this Agreement).

 



 

Section 8.15 _Financial Information_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Sellers shall provide, and
GWLA shall cause the GWLA Subsidiaries to provide, reasonable cooperation in

any other relevant insurance regulatory authority, (ii) any document to be
filed with or furnished to the SEC by Buyer or any of its Affiliates pursuant
to the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (or any rules
and regulations thereunder) or (iii) any prospectus, private placement
memorandum or other offering document to be used in connection with any public
offering, private placement or other financing transaction of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, including by furnishing to Buyer upon its reasonable request
any audited or unaudited financial statement, audit reports or other financial
information or data with respect to pre-Closing periods the Business, in each
case, to the extent prepared in the ordinary course and reasonably available
to Sellers or the GWLA Subsidiaries through the exercise of commercially
reasonable efforts.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall promptly, upon request by Sellers, reimburse Sellers and their
Affiliates, as applicable, for all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs
and expenses together with a reasonable allocation of overhead expenses
incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates, as applicable, in connection with the
cooperation contemplated by this _Section 8.15_.

 



 

Section 8.16 _Discovered Policies_. If, during the period following the
execution of this Agreement until the five (5) year anniversary of the Closing

believes should be included on _Schedule 1.1(e)_ because it is otherwise
identified or described on the internal systems, books and records or other
data of Sellers as constituting part of the Individual Markets Segment but was
excluded from such Schedule inadvertently or for a good faith reason, and is
not an Administered-Only Policy or Excluded Policy listed on _Schedule 1.1(k)_
(each such Policy, a " _Discovered Policy_ "), such Party shall promptly
notify the other Parties in writing of the existence of such Discovered
Policy, and the Parties shall cooperate and negotiate in good faith with
respect to such matter and, if the Parties mutually agree as a result of such
good faith cooperation and negotiation, to supplement _Schedule 1.1(e)_ to
include such Discovered Policy as a Covered Insurance Policy as though it had
originally been set forth on _Schedule 1.1(e)_, including the amount payable
to the relevant Reinsurer in respect of the reinsurance of the applicable
Liabilities relating to such Discovered Policy to the extent that reserves for
such Liabilities were not otherwise appropriately taken into account or
reflected in the Closing Statement of General Account Net Settlement (as
finally determined pursuant to _Section 2.4)_, and the applicable Seller
shall transfer to the Reinsurer Eligible Assets with a Fair Market Value equal
to such amount, if any, as a condition to the effectiveness of such amendment
to _Schedule1.1(e)_. The Parties shall take such actions, execute such
instruments and otherwise cooperate to the extent reasonably necessary to give
effect to the foregoing, including supplementing Schedule 1.1(A) of the
applicable Reinsurance Agreement to include an agreed-upon Discovered Policy
as though it had originally been set forth on such Schedule 1.1(A).

 



 

Section 8.17 _No Financing Condition_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement or in any of the Ancillary Agreements, Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that its and each Buyer Partys obligations to effect

the event that any fact, event or circumstance results in payment to a

and such fact, event or circumstance would also constitute a breach of or
inaccuracy in any of a Sellers representations or warranties under this
Agreement, such Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Person with respect to such breach or inaccuracy to the extent of
such Reinsurance Settlement Amount;

 



 

(iv) The amount of any Loss sustained by any Indemnified Party shall be

amount; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 11.1(d)(iv)_ shall
obligate any Party to maintain any insurance); (B) the net amount of any
indemnity payment, contribution or other similar payment such Buyer or any
Buyer Indemnified Person or Seller or any Seller Indemnified Person, as the
case may be, actually received from any third party not Affiliated with such
Indemnified Party with respect to such Loss; and (C) an amount equal to the

for any Loss to the extent that such Loss was specifically reflected or
reserved for on the Closing Statement of General Account Net Settlement, as
finally resolved in accordance with _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.4_.

 



 

(e) The rights and remedies of any party in respect of any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall in no way
be limited by the fact that the act, omission, occurrence or other state of
facts or circumstances upon which any claim of any such inaccuracy or breach
is based may also be the subject matter of any other representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement as to which there is no inaccuracy or breach. The
representations, warranties and covenants of the parties, and the Indemnified
Parties rights to indemnification with respect thereto, shall not be affected
or deemed waived by reason of (and the Indemnified Parties shall be deemed to
have relied upon the representations

 



     

 

 



 

and warranties of any other party set forth herein notwithstanding) (i) any
investigation made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party or any of its
Representatives or by reason of the fact that any of the Indemnified Parties
or any of such Representatives knew or should have known that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, regardless of
whether such investigation was made or such knowledge was obtained before or
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or (ii) the waiver of any
condition by such Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates set forth in

Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance, which shall be subject to
indemnification in accordance with _Article XII_.

 



 

Section 11.2 _Notice of Claim; Defense_.

 



 

(a) If (i) any non-affiliated third party (a " _Third Party_ ") or
Governmental Body institutes, threatens or asserts any Action that may give
rise to Losses for which a Party (an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") may be liable
for indemnification under this _Article XI_ (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") or
(ii) any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement (an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall have a claim to be indemnified by an Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party
shall promptly send to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the
nature of such claim and a good faith estimate of the amount of all related
Losses (a " _Claim Notice_ "). The failure of an Indemnified Party to give a
timely and adequate Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations under this _Article XI_ except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure, it being understood
that Claim Notices in respect of a breach of a representation or warranty must
be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period
specified in _Section 11.1(d)(i)_ for such representation or warranty and
that Claim Notices in respect of a breach of a covenant or agreement must be
delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified
in _Section 14.1_ for such covenant or agreement; _provided_ , that if, prior
to such applicable date, the Indemnified Party shall have notified the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with the requirements of this _Section
11.2(a)_ of a claim for indemnification under this _Article XI_ (whether or
not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon such claim), such
claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification in accordance with this
_Article XI_ notwithstanding the passing of such applicable date.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party may, by notice delivered within twenty (20)
Business Days after the receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to a Third-
Party Claim, assume the defense and control of such Third-Party Claim (at the
expense of such Indemnifying Party). The Indemnified Party may take any
actions reasonably necessary to defend any Third-Party Claim prior to the time
that it receives notice from the Indemnifying Party as contemplated by the
preceding sentence. The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume or
maintain control of the defense of any Third-Party Claim and shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the Indemnified Party if
(i) the Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal
or insurance regulatory enforcement proceeding, action, indictment, allegation
or investigation against the Indemnified Party or (ii) the Third-Party Claim
would reasonably be expected to result in an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party that would, in each case, have a material effect
on the operation of the business of such Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates.

 



 

(c) Subject to _Section 11.2(b)_, in the event of a Third-Party Claim, if the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party may elect to retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Parties to represent such Indemnified Parties in connection with
such Action and shall pay the fees, charges and disbursements of such counsel.
Subject to _Section 11.2(b)_, if the Indemnifying Party so elects, the
Indemnified Parties may participate, at their own expense and through legal
counsel of their choice, in any such Action; _provided_ , that (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall control the

 



     

 

 



 

defense of the Indemnified Parties in connection with such Action and (ii) the
Indemnified Parties and their counsel shall reasonably cooperate with the
Indemnifying Party and its counsel in connection with such Action. The
Indemnifying Party shall not settle any such Action without the relevant
Indemnified Parties prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the terms of such settlement (A)
provide for no relief other than the payment of monetary damages in an amount
less than or equal to the maximum indemnification responsibility of the
Indemnifying Party, (B) involve no finding or admission of any breach or
violation by any Indemnified Party and (C) include an express unconditional
release of each Indemnified Party from all Liability arising from such Action.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying Party elects not to retain
counsel and assume control of such defense, then the Indemnified Parties shall
retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Party in connection
with such Action and assume control of the defense in connection with such
Action, and the fees, charges and disbursements of no more than one such
counsel per jurisdiction selected by the Indemnified Parties shall be
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Under no circumstances will the
Indemnifying Party have any liability in connection with any settlement of any
Action that is entered into without its prior written consent (which shall not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(d) From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice involving a Third-Party
Claim, at the reasonable request of the Indemnifying Party, each Indemnified
Party shall grant the Indemnifying Party and its counsel, experts and
Representatives full access, during normal business hours, to the books,
records, personnel and properties of the Indemnified Party to the extent
reasonably related to such Claim Notice at no cost to the Indemnifying Party
(other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Indemnified Parties),
subject to any _bona fide_ claims of attorney-client privilege.

 



 

(e) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a Claim Notice from an
Indemnified Party that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party shall notify the Indemnified Party within sixty (60) Business Days
following its receipt of such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes
its liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article XI_; _provided_
that the failure of an Indemnifying Party to give such notice shall not affect
such Indemnifying Partys obligations under this _Article XI_ except to the
extent that the Indemnified Party is prejudiced by such failure to give such
notice.

 



 

(f) If there shall be any conflicts between the provisions of this _Section
11.2_ and _Article XII_, the provisions of _Article XII_ shall control with
respect to Tax contests.

 



 

Section 11.3 _No Duplication; Exclusive Remedy_.

 



 

(a) Any Liability for indemnification hereunder and under any Ancillary
Agreement shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the
same Loss.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, other than in the case of actual fraud by a Seller,
the sole and exclusive remedy of Buyer for any breach or inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or any certificate or
instrument delivered hereunder shall be refusal to close the transactions
contemplated hereunder in accordance with _Sections 9.1(a)_ or _(b)_ and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Article XIII_.

 



 

(c) Except as provided under (i) _Section 2.4_, (ii) the provisions of
_Article XII_ (relating to Tax matters), (iii) the provisions hereof
providing for equitable remedies, (iv) the provisions of any Ancillary
Agreement (other than the Bill of Sale and the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement) or (v) in the case of actual fraud, from and after the Closing, the
exclusive remedy of Sellers, the Seller Indemnified Persons, Buyer and the
Buyer Indemnified Persons in connection with this Agreement (and any
certificate or instrument delivered hereunder) and the transactions
contemplated hereby (whether under this Agreement or arising under Applicable
Law) shall be as provided in this _Article XI_.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 11.4 _Limitation on Set-off_. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall have any
right to set off any unresolved indemnification claim pursuant to this
_Article XI_ against any payment due pursuant to any Ancillary Agreement.

 



 

Section 11.5 _Mitigation_. Buyer and each Seller shall cooperate with each
other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect to which
one Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party under this _Article XI_,
including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate such claim or
liability to the extent required by Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 11.6 _Recovery by Indemnified Party_. In any case where an Indemnified
Party recovers from a third party not Affiliated with such Indemnified Party
any amount in respect of any Loss for which an Indemnifying Party has actually
reimbursed it pursuant to this _Article XI_ (but only to the extent that such
Person would otherwise retain an amount greater than the full amount of the
Losses sustained by such Indemnified Party as a result of the underlying
claim), such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying
Party the amount so recovered (net of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
such Indemnified Party in collecting such amount), but not in excess of the
sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount
expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising
out of such matter.

 



 

Section 11.7 _Reserves_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, none of Sellers nor any of their Affiliates makes any representation
or warranty with respect to, and nothing contained in this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement, document or instrument to be
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby
is intended or shall be construed to be a representation or warranty (express
or implied) of any Seller or any of its Affiliates, for any purpose of this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement, document or
instrument to be delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, with respect to: (i) the adequacy or sufficiency of any of
the Reserves with respect to the Reinsured Business, (ii) the future
profitability of the Reinsured Business or (iii) the effect of the adequacy or
sufficiency of such Reserves on any "line item" or asset, liability or equity
amount. Furthermore, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the adequacy or
sufficiency of Reserves will not, in and of itself, form the basis of a
determination that any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other agreement,
document or instrument to be delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby has been breached.

 



 

Section 11.8 _Retained Claims_. Following the Closing, Sellers shall, at their
own expense, have the sole power to direct and control each claim set forth in
_Schedule 1.1(j)_ , and any matter that involves a claim by any Person, known
or unknown, involving substantially the same set of facts or circumstances as
were involved in any claim set forth in _Schedule 1.1(j)_ (the " _Retained
Claims_ "), with legal counsel of their choosing. Buyer, as the Indemnified
Party, may participate, at its own expense and through legal counsel of its
choice, in any such Retained Claim; _provided_ , that (i) Sellers shall
control the defense of Buyer in connection with such Retained Claim and (ii)
Buyer and its counsel shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers and their
counsel in connection with such Retained Claim. Sellers shall not consent to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the
Retained Claim to the extent such judgment or settlement purports to restrict
the future operations of the Reinsured Business without the prior written
consent of the Buyer, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. At the reasonable request of Sellers, Buyer shall
grant Sellers and their counsel, experts and Representatives full access,
during normal business hours, to the books, records, personnel and properties
of Buyer to the extent reasonably related to such Retained Claim at no cost to
Sellers (other than for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of Buyer).

 



     

 

 



 

 **ARTICLE XII** ** 
TAX MATTERS**

 



 

Section 12.1 _Transfer Taxes_. Any Transfer Tax imposed by any Tax Authority
in connection with this Agreement and any other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by
Sellers, whether levied on a Seller, Buyer or their respective Affiliates.

 



 

Section 12.2 _Tax Returns and Covenants_.

 



 

(a) Buyer shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, all
Straddle Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to the Acquired Assets
and/or the Business and pay the Taxes shown to be due thereon; _provided_ ,
that Sellers shall promptly reimburse Buyer for the portion of such Tax that
relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period. Sellers will furnish to Buyer all
information and records reasonably requested by Buyer for use in preparation
of any Straddle Tax Returns. Buyer shall allow Sellers to review, comment upon
and reasonably approve without undue delay any Straddle Tax Return at any time
during the sixty (60) day period immediately preceding the filing of such Tax
Return.

 



 

(b) In the case of any Straddle Period, (i) real, personal and intangible
property Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") with respect to the Acquired Assets
and/or the Business for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be equal to the
amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is
the number of days in the Straddle Period; and (ii) all other Taxes relating
to the Acquired Assets and/or the Business (other than income Taxes), if any,
shall be apportioned on the basis of a closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Agreement, Sellers and Buyer
shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, upon request, as
promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating to the
Acquired Assets (including access to books and records as well as the timely
provision of powers of attorney or similar authorizations) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns related to the Acquired Assets,
the preparation for any audit relating to such Tax Returns, and the
prosecution or defense of any audit, proposed adjustment or deficiency,
assessment, claim, suit or other proceeding relating to such Tax Returns. For
the avoidance of doubt, nothing herein shall require Sellers to provide Buyer
access to any federal, state or local income, franchise or similar Tax Return
that includes a Seller or its Affiliates. Any information obtained under this
_Section 12.2(c)_ shall be kept confidential, except as otherwise reasonably
may be necessary in connection with the filing of Tax Returns or claims for
refund or in conducting any Tax audit, dispute or contest.

 



 

(d) Without the prior written consent of GWLA (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), none of Buyer or its
Affiliates shall, to the extent it may affect Sellers and their relevant
Subsidiaries with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, make or change any Tax
election, file any amended Tax Return, enter into any closing agreement or any
other agreement or arrangement with any Tax Authority, settle any Tax claim or
assessment, surrender any right to claim a Tax refund, offset or other
reduction in Tax liability or consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment. This _Section
12.2(d)_ shall not apply to any action in the ordinary course of business to
the extent consistent with the most recent past practices of a Seller or its
relevant Subsidiaries, or as may be required by Applicable Law.

 



 

(e) (i) Buyer shall promptly notify GWLA in writing upon receipt by Buyer or
any of its Affiliates of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state,
local or foreign Tax audits or assessments relating to any taxable period
ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period or relating to a
Tax for which any Seller may be liable pursuant to this Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) Sellers shall have the sole right to control the conduct of any Tax audit
or administrative or court proceeding relating to the Business or the Acquired
Assets for a taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or relating
solely to a Tax for which any Seller otherwise may be liable pursuant to this
Agreement, and to employ counsel of Sellers choice at Sellers expense;
_provided_ , that Buyer and its Representatives shall be permitted, at Buyers
expense, to be present at, and participate in, any such audit or proceeding.
Neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer shall be entitled to settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any claim for Taxes
that could adversely affect the liability for Taxes relating to any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date or to any Straddle Period or
relating to a Tax for which any Seller would be liable pursuant to this
Agreement without the prior written consent of Sellers. Sellers may discharge
at any time their indemnification obligation under _Section 12.4(a)_ by
paying Buyer the amount payable pursuant to _Section 12.4(a)_, calculated on
the date of such payment.

 



 

Section 12.3 _Tax Characterizations of Adjustments_. Sellers and Buyer agree
to treat, Buyer shall cause its Affiliates to and GWLA shall cause the GWLA
Subsidiaries to treat, all payments made either to or for the benefit of the
other under any indemnity provisions of this Agreement and for any
misrepresentations or breach of warranty or covenants as adjustments to the
consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement and that such treatment shall
govern for purposes hereof.

 



 

Section 12.4 _Tax Indemnification and Parties  Responsibility_.

 



 

(a) Except to the extent such Taxes are subject to indemnification by Buyer
pursuant to _Section 12.4(b)(ii)_, GWLA shall indemnify and hold harmless
each Buyer Indemnified Person from and against (i) all Pre-Closing Taxes (or
the non-payment thereof) and (ii) all Taxes imposed on or with respect to
Buyer or its Affiliates arising from or relating to any breach by such Seller
or its Affiliates of any covenant under this _Article XII_ (other than the
indemnities contained in _Section 12.6_) or any representation or warranty
under _Section 5.6(a)_.

 



 

(b) Except to the extent such Taxes are subject to indemnification by Sellers
pursuant to _Section 12.4(a)_, Buyer and its relevant Subsidiaries shall be
solely responsible for, and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller Indemnified Person from and against (i) all Taxes imposed on or with
respect to the Acquired Assets or the Business, as applicable (A) for Taxable
periods beginning after the Closing Date and (B) with respect to Straddle
Periods, for the portion of such Taxes allocable to the period after the
Closing Date (as determined under _Section 12.2(b)_), and (ii) all Taxes
imposed on or with respect to a Seller or its Affiliates, the Acquired Assets
or the Business, arising from or relating to any breach by Buyer or its
Affiliates of any covenant under this _Article XII_ (other than the
indemnities contained in _Section 12.6_).

 



 

(c) The indemnities provided for in _Section 12.4(a)_ and _Section 12.4(b)_
shall survive until thirty (30) days following the expiry of the applicable
statute of limitations in respect of the Taxes subject to indemnification as
provided herein.

 



 

(d) There shall be no obligation on the part of GWLA to indemnify Buyer under
_Section 12.4(a)_ to the extent the Tax liability arises as a result of or
relates to any action outside of the ordinary course of business taken or
omitted to be taken after the Closing on the Closing Date by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates.

 



 

(e) To the extent an amount indemnifiable under this _Section 12.4_, or the
underlying matter that gives rise to such indemnifiable amount, gives rise to
a cash Tax Benefit that is actually realized by the indemnified party in the
taxable year in which the breach or obligation giving rise to such
indemnification

 



     

 

 



 

obligation occurs, such indemnified party shall refund to the indemnifying
party the amount of such Tax Benefit (up to, but not in excess of, the amount
of such indemnification payment) when realized. For purpose of this paragraph,
a " _Tax Benefit_ " means the net amount by which the cash Tax liability of
the indemnified party (or the group of which it is a member) is reduced, net
of any Tax effect on the indemnified party or any of its Affiliates
attributable to the reduction in such cash Tax liability.

 



 

Section 12.5 _Tax Refunds_. Sellers shall retain the right to any Tax refunds
or credits that are attributable to the Business or the Acquired Assets in
respect of Pre-Closing Tax Periods (or portions thereof) and that are actually
received by Buyer, a Seller or their respective Affiliates (or otherwise
credited against Tax).

 



 

Section 12.6 _Indemnification for Product Tax Non-Compliance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to _Section 12.6(d)-(g)_:

 



 

(i) Except to the extent such Losses result from (A) any Buyer Product Tax
Non-Compliance, or (B) a change in Applicable Law (or a Tax Authoritys
written interpretation thereof) after the Closing Date, GWLA shall indemnify
and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Person from and against all Losses
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Person to the extent arising out of or
resulting from any actual or alleged Product Tax Non-Compliance or a breach by
any Seller or any of its Affiliates of the terms of any Ancillary Agreement
where the claim to which such Losses relate is made during (I) the Post-
Closing Three-Year Period with respect to a Buyer Claim and (II) the Post-
Closing Five-Year Period with respect to a Related Claim. Subject to _Section
12.6(d)-(g)_, the amount of any such Losses shall include any reasonable costs
incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Person to resolve any Product Tax Non-
Compliance, any related costs of remediation (including costs incurred in
connection with obtaining remediation or other corrective relief from the
IRS), and any amounts attributable to Related Claims made against the Buyer
Indemnified Person for the Product Tax Non-Compliance.

 



 

(ii) GWLA shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnified Person from
and against all Liabilities constituting "Ceding Company Extra-Contractual
Obligations" (as defined in the applicable Reinsurance Agreement) incurred by
the Buyer Indemnified Person to the extent attributable to any Product Tax
Non-Compliance.

 



 

(b) From and after the Closing, subject to _Section 12.6(d)_, _(g)_ and
_(f):_

 



 

(i) Except to the extent such Losses result from a change in Applicable Law
(or a Tax Authoritys written interpretation thereof) after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Indemnified Person from
and against all Losses incurred by the Seller Indemnified Person to the extent
arising out of or resulting from any Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance where
the claim to which such Losses relate is made during the Post-Closing Three-
Year Period (after which no Seller Indemnified Person shall have the right to
bring, assert, claim, or otherwise pursue any such claim under this _Section
12.6(b)(i)_). Subject to _Section 12.6(d)_, _(f)_ and _(g)_ , the amount of
any such Losses shall include any reasonable costs incurred by the Seller
Indemnified Person to resolve any Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance, any
related costs of remediation (including costs incurred in connection with
obtaining remediation or other corrective relief from

 



     

 

 



 

the IRS), and any amounts attributable to Related Claims made against the
Seller Indemnified Person for the Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance.

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Indemnified Person
from and against all Liabilities constituting "Reinsurer Extra-Contractual
Obligations" (as defined in the applicable Reinsurance Agreement) incurred by
the Seller Indemnified Person to the extent attributable to any Buyer Product
Tax Non-Compliance.

 



 

(c) Any Person intending to claim indemnification under this _Section 12.6_
must promptly provide written notice to Buyer or GWLA, as the case may be, of
each claim of Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance
(including any arising as claims under _Section 12.6(a)(ii)_ or _Section
12.6(b)(ii)_ as "Ceding Company Extra-Contractual Obligations" or "Reinsurer
Extra-Contractual Obligations" (any such claim, an " _ECO Claim_ ")) (a "
_Product Tax Claim_ ", and such notice, a " _Product Tax Claim Notice_ ") that
could reasonably be expected to give rise to a claim for indemnification
pursuant to this _Section 12.6_, after the facts or circumstances providing
the basis for such Product Tax Claim become known to such Person (but, in any
event, promptly after receipt of any notice of a Related Claim). A Product Tax
Claim Notice shall contain (i) a summary of the facts (set forth with
reasonable specificity) underlying or relating to the Product Tax Claim, (ii)
any correspondence, notice or other written communication received from any
Third Party with respect to the Product Tax Claim, and (iii) a statement that
the claimant seeks indemnification for a Loss arising from the Product Tax
Claim and the basis therefor. The failure of an Indemnified Party to give a
timely and adequate Product Tax Claim Notice shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this _Article XII_ except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such failure.

 



 

(d) _Defense of Related Claims_.

 



 

(i) GWLA and Buyer shall jointly control the defense and resolution of any
Related Claim, _provided_ that either Party may solely control such defense
and resolution at its own expense by, within thirty (30) days after such
Partys receipt of the related Product Tax Claim Notice, providing to the
other Party written notice of its agreement that, with respect to any Losses
resulting from the resolution of such Related Claim, it will indemnify the
Seller Indemnified Person or the Buyer Indemnified Person (as the case may be)
as provided in this _Section 12.6_. If the Parties jointly control such
defense and resolution, then (X) each Party shall participate in such defense
and resolution at its own expense, and (Y) neither Party shall consent to the
entry of judgment or admit any liability with respect to or settle,
compromise, discharge, or otherwise resolve any Related Claim without the
other Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned). The remediation of any Product Tax Non-
Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance related to a Related Claim
shall be controlled as provided in _Section 12.6(f)_.

 



 

(ii) To the extent a Party is not controlling the defense and resolution of a
Related Claim pursuant to _Section 12.6(d)(i)_, such Party shall have the
right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense and resolution of
any Related Claim at its own expense and to employ counsel separate from the
counsel employed by the other Party at the first Partys own expense and such
Party shall not settle, compromise or otherwise resolve any Related Claim
without the prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) of the other Party. The Parties shall cooperate in the
defense and resolution of any Related

 



     

 

 



 

Claim, _provided_ that such cooperation shall not unreasonably interfere with
the business or operations of either Party.

 



 

(iii) Upon a settlement, compromise, or other resolution of any Related Claim
(a " _Related Claim Resolution_ ") that causes a Party to have an
indemnification obligation under _Section 12.6(a)_ or _Section 12.6(b)_,
such Party shall pay (A) all indemnified amounts due to the relevant Third
Party or Governmental Body as a result of such Related Claim Resolution within
the time set forth under such Related Claim Resolution and (B) all other
amounts (if any) for which such Party is required to indemnify the other Party
or its Affiliates pursuant to _Section 12.6(a)_ with respect to such Related
Claim Resolution as such amounts are paid by such other Party or its
Affiliates; _provided_ that, in respect of any amount described in clause (B),
the indemnified Party shall promptly provide the indemnifying Party with
written notice that, and information reasonably sufficient to verify that,
such payment has been made.

 



 

(e) During (i) the Post-Closing Three-Year Period, a Buyer Claim may be
brought by Buyer pursuant to _Section 12.6(a)(i)_ and (ii) the Post-Closing
Five-Year Period, a Related Claim may be brought by Buyer pursuant to _Section
12.6(a)(i)_. Upon the expiration of (I) the Post-Closing Three-Year Period,
Buyer shall no longer have the right to bring, assert, claim, or otherwise
pursue any Buyer Claim other than with respect to (x) any matter set forth in
a Product Tax Claim Notice delivered prior to the expiration of the Post-
Closing Three-Year Period and (y) an ECO Claim and (II) the Post-Closing Five-
Year Period, Buyer shall no longer have the right to bring, assert, claim, or
otherwise pursue any Related Claim other than with respect to (x) any matter
set forth in a Product Tax Claim Notice delivered prior to the expiration of
the Post-Closing Five-Year Period and (y) an ECO Claim. For the avoidance of
doubt, the Product Tax Claim Notice referred to in the preceding sentence must
describe the Buyer Claim or Related Claim, as applicable, in accordance with
the notice requirements of _Section 12.6(c)_ in order for Buyer to have the
right to bring, assert, claim, or otherwise pursue such Buyer Claim or Related
Claim, respectively, following the expiration of the Post-Closing Three-Year
Period or the Post-Closing Five-Year Period, respectively.

 



 

(f) _Remediation of Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-
Compliance_.

 



 

(i) With respect to any Product Tax Claim, Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate
to determine whether there has been Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer
Product Tax Non-Compliance, and, if necessary, to develop corrective measures
that are reasonable and cost effective, taking into account all of the
relevant facts and circumstances then applicable (including, without
limitation, obtaining remediation or other corrective relief from the IRS), in
order to remediate such Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-
Compliance. In addition, each Party shall, upon becoming aware of any Product
Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance, consult with the other
Party to the extent reasonably practicable and, prior to the implementation of
full corrective measures pursuant to clauses (ii) and (iii) below, use
commercially reasonable efforts to correct any deficiency in any process,
procedures or systems used in the administration of the Reinsured Business,
and otherwise to mitigate any Losses resulting in such Product Tax Non-
Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance, in each case, after taking
into account the relevant costs to the Parties (after taking into account
expected recoveries) arising out of such Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer
Product Tax Non-Compliance, including the Parties respective obligations
under this _Article XII_.

 



      

 

 



 

(ii) If Sellers and Buyer agree that Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer
Product Tax Non-Compliance has occurred, and agree with respect to the
appropriate corrective measures, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate to
implement such corrective measures.

 



 

(iii) If Sellers and Buyer cannot agree (A) whether Product Tax Non-Compliance
or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance has occurred, or (B) with respect to the
appropriate corrective measures, the dispute may be submitted to a nationally
recognized law firm, actuarial firm, or the Accounting Firm, as mutually
agreed to by the parties (the " _Firm_ "), for arbitration at either Partys
option. In the event that a dispute has been submitted to the Firm for
arbitration, Seller and Buyer shall deliver to the Firm copies of any
schedules, documentation or other materials that may reasonably be required by
the Firm to make its determination. The Firm will be required to determine
whether Product Tax Non-Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance has
occurred (if in dispute) and to select either the corrective measures proposed
by Sellers or the corrective measures proposed by Buyer, based on which
proposed corrective measures are more appropriate, reasonable, and cost
effective under all of the relevant facts and circumstances then applicable.
In such determination, the Firm shall take into account any final
determination made by the IRS with respect to the potential Product Tax Non-
Compliance or Buyer Product Tax Non-Compliance. The Firm shall render a
determination within sixty (60) days of the referral of such matter for
resolution. The determinations of the Firm shall be final and binding on all
Parties for all purposes of this Agreement. Arbitration costs will be shared
equally by the relevant Seller and Buyer.

 



 

(g) The provisions set forth on _Schedule 12.6_ shall apply to the obligations
of the Parties under this _Section 12.6_.

 



 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, any Liabilities owed to non-affiliated third
parties that arise out of or relate to any Product Tax Non-Compliance that
constitute Losses or Liabilities with respect to which any Buyer Indemnified
Person is entitled to indemnification from GWLA pursuant to this _Section
12.6_ shall, to the extent of such indemnification obligation, be deemed
Liabilities that did not transfer to, and were not reinsured or assumed by,
the Buyer Indemnified Person as part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and that they remained Liabilities of
Sellers. It is the Parties intention that GWLA shall, to the extent of its
indemnification obligation hereunder, be responsible for satisfying such
Liabilities directly.

 



 

(i) The indemnities provided for in this _Section 12.6_ shall survive
indefinitely.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIII** **

to the Closing Date:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Buyer and Sellers;

 



 

(b) by Buyer in the event of a material breach by Sellers of any of Sellers
covenants, agreements, representations or warranties contained herein that
would reasonably be expected to result in the conditions to Closing set forth
in _Section 9.1(a)_ or _Section 9.1(b)_ not being satisfied on or prior to
the

 



     

 

 



 

Termination Date; _provided_ , that, if curable, Sellers shall have failed to

Buyer requesting such breach to be cured;

 



 

(c) by Sellers in the event of a material breach by Buyer of any of Buyers

to cure such breach within thirty (30) days after receipt of written notice
from Sellers requesting such breach to be cured;

 



 

(d) by Sellers upon the occurrence of any event that, assuming the Reinsurance

is defined in the Reinsurance Agreements) (ignoring for this purpose any
applicable cure period provided for in the Reinsurance Agreements);

 



 

(e) by Buyer or Sellers if any court of competent jurisdiction shall have
issued a final and non-appealable Court Order permanently restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the transactions

(f) by Buyer or Sellers if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before

that would have been the Termination Date the conditions set forth in _Section
9.2_ or _Section 10.2_ are the only conditions in _Article IX_ or _Article
X_ (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Closing) that shall not have been satisfied or waived on or before such date,
the Termination Date shall automatically be extended to February 3, 2020
without any action by any of the Parties.

 



 

Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 13.1_ to the contrary, no Party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f)
above if its failure to perform, or delay in performing, any of its
obligations or covenants, or the inaccuracy or any of its representations or
warranties, in this Agreement, has been the principal cause of, or has
resulted in, the event or condition purportedly giving rise to a right to
terminate this Agreement under such paragraph.

 



 

Section 13.2 _Notice of Termination_. Any Party desiring to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 13.1_ (other than _Section 13.1(a)_) shall
give written notice of such termination to the other Parties to this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 13.3 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement shall
be terminated pursuant to this _Article XIII_, all further obligations of the
Parties under this Agreement (other than _Section 8.6_, this _Section 13.3_
and _Article XIV_ (other than _Section 14.1_ and _Section 14.2_)) shall be
terminated without further Liability of any Party to the others; _provided_ ,
that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from Liability for actual fraud or
Willful Breach.

 



 

 **ARTICLE XIV** ** 
GENERAL PROVISIONS**

 



 

Section 14.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties and Covenants_. All
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement through the
period during which claims for indemnification may be made for such
representations and warranties pursuant to _Article XI_ or _Article XII_, as
applicable (at which time such representations and warranties shall
terminate). All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement that by
their terms apply or are to be performed in their entirety on or prior to the
Closing shall,

 



     

 

 



 

for purposes of indemnification under _Article XI_, expire on the date that
is eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, after which no claim for
indemnification with respect thereto may be brought hereunder. Any other
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement shall, for purposes of
indemnification under _Article XI_, survive for six (6) months beyond the
period provided in such covenant or agreement, if any, or otherwise, until
fully performed, after which no claim for indemnification with respect thereto
may be brought hereunder.

 



 

Section 14.2 _Remedies_. Each Party agrees that any failure to perform, or
breach of its obligations under this Agreement may result in irreparable
injury to each other Party, that the remedies available to such other Party at
law alone will be an inadequate remedy for such failure or breach and that, in
addition to any other legal or equitable remedies that such other Party may
have, such other Party may be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
specifically enforce its rights under this Agreement and the Parties expressly
waive the defense that a remedy in damages will be adequate or that an award
of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or
equity. Any Party seeking an order or injunction to prevent or cure breaches
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

 



 

Section 14.3 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the internal laws (as opposed to the conflicts of
law provisions) of the State of New York (other than Sections 5-1401 and
5-1402 of the General Obligations Law, which shall apply).

 



 

Section 14.4 _Jurisdiction; Venue_. Except as contemplated by _Article II_,
each of the Parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any and all Actions arising
out of, relating to or in connection with this Agreement or its subject matter
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and
enforcement of any settlement or judgment in respect of this Agreement and the
rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any other Party hereto or
its successors or assigns, shall be brought and determined exclusively in the
courts of the State of New York located in the Borough of Manhattan, the City
of New York or in the courts of the United States of America for the Southern
District of New York. Each of the Parties agrees that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any such Action in the manner provided in
_Section 14.6_ or in such other manner as may be permitted by Applicable
Laws, will be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each of the Parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Action for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
Action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement in any court or tribunal other than the aforesaid courts. Each
of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder (a) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
Agreement, (b) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (c) to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, any
claim that (i) the Action in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum,
(ii) the venue of such Action is improper or (iii) this Agreement, or the
subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. In order to
facilitate the comprehensive resolution of related disputes, and upon request
of any Party to any Action, the court may consolidate the Action with any
other Action relating to this Agreement or to any Ancillary Agreement and the
Parties hereby agree not to oppose any request by the other Party to
consolidate any such Action with another Action relating to this Agreement or
to any Ancillary Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 14.5 _Jury Waiver_. EACH PARTY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY

ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER
INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS IN THIS
SECTION.

assignable or delegable by such Party hereto without the written consent of
the other Parties.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the

Indemnified Persons any right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 14.8 _Entire Agreement; Amendments_. This Agreement, the Exhibits and
Schedules referred to herein, the documents delivered pursuant hereto, the
Confidentiality Agreements and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire
understanding of the Parties hereto with regard to the subject matter
contained herein or therein, and supersede all other prior representations,
warranties, agreements, understandings or letters of intent between or among
any of the Parties hereto which representations, warranties, agreements,
understandings or letters of intent shall be of no force or effect for any
purpose. Except for updates to _Sections 5.14(e)_ and _8.1(a)(i) of the
Business Disclosure Schedule_, or supplements to _Schedule 1.1(e)_ made
pursuant to _Sections 8.16_ , this Agreement shall not be amended, modified or
supplemented except by a written instrument signed by an authorized
representative of each of the Parties hereto or their respective successors in
interest.

 



 

Section 14.9 _Interpretation_. The table of contents, articles, titles and
headings to sections herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and
are not intended to be a part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. The Schedules and Exhibits referred to herein shall be
construed with and as an integral part of this Agreement to the same extent as
if they were set forth verbatim herein. All references herein to Articles,
Sections, Exhibits and Schedules shall be construed to refer to Articles and
Sections of, and Exhibits and Schedules to, this Agreement. Whenever the words
"include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Unless the context
otherwise requires, the words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of
similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "made
available" as used in this Agreement shall mean, with respect to any document,
agreement or information, that such document, agreement or information has
been posted to the electronic data room hosted on Intralinks at
https://services.intralinks.com under the folder labeled "Project Indigo" at
least two (2) Business Days prior to the date hereof. All terms defined in
this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate or
other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as
well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the
feminine genders of such term. Any statute or regulation referred to herein
means such statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented or
replaced from time to time (and, in the case of any statute, includes any
rules and regulations promulgated under such statute), and references to any
section of any statute or regulation include any successor to such section.
Any agreement referred to herein shall include reference to all Exhibits,
Schedules and other documents or agreements attached thereto. The phrase
"related to the Business" shall not have the meaning attributed to "Related to
the Business". The singular form of the word "Party" may refer to Sellers
collectively if the context requires.

 



 

Section 14.10 _Waivers_. Any term or provision of this Agreement may be
waived, or the time for its performance may be extended, in writing at any
time by the Party or Parties entitled to the benefit thereof. Any such waiver
shall be validly and sufficiently authorized for the purposes of this
Agreement if, as to any Party, it is authorized in writing by an authorized
representative of such Party. The failure of any Party hereto to enforce at
any time any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed to be a waiver
of such provision, nor in any way to affect the validity of this Agreement or
any part hereof or the right of any Party thereafter to enforce each and every
such provision. No waiver of any breach of this Agreement shall be held to
constitute a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach.

 



     

 

 



 

Section 14.11 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, each Party hereto will pay all costs
and expenses incident to its negotiation and preparation of this Agreement and
to its performance and compliance with all agreements and conditions contained
herein or therein on its part to be performed or complied with, including the
fees, expenses and disbursements of its counsel and independent public
accountants.

 



 

Section 14.12 _Partial Invalidity_. Wherever possible, each provision hereof
shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under
Applicable Law, but in case any one or more of the provisions contained herein
shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent, but only to the
extent, of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without
invalidating the remainder of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision
or provisions or any other provisions hereof, unless such a construction would
be unreasonable. The Parties shall work together in good faith to attempt to
replace the invalid provision(s) in a manner that reasonably reflects the
original intent of this Agreement.

 



 

Section 14.13 _Execution in Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, including by electronic delivery in .pdf format,
each of which shall be considered an original instrument, but all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement, and shall become binding when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties hereto and
delivered to Sellers and Buyer.

 



 

Section 14.14 _No Public Announcement_. Neither the Parties nor any Affiliates
of the Parties shall, without the approval of Buyer, in the case of Sellers
and their Affiliates, and Sellers, in the case of Buyer and its Affiliates, in
each case not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, make any
press release or other public announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, except as and to
the extent that any such Person shall be so obligated by Applicable Law or the
rules of any stock exchange, in which case the non-disclosing Parties shall be
advised and the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause a
mutually agreeable release or announcement to be issued; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not preclude communications or disclosures necessary to
implement the provisions of this Agreement, to comply with the accounting and
the SEC disclosure obligations or the rules of any stock exchange or as
otherwise required to comply with Applicable Law.

 



 

Section 14.15 _Disclosure Schedules_. Any disclosure with respect to a Section
of any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed for purposes of
other Sections of such Disclosure Schedule to the extent that such disclosure
sets forth facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure
to such other Sections would be reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure to a reader of such disclosure. Matters reflected in any Section of
a Disclosure Schedule are not necessarily limited to matters required by this
Agreement to be so reflected. Such additional matters are set forth for
informational purposes and do not necessarily include other matters of a
similar nature. No reference to or disclosure of any item or other matter in
any Section of a Disclosure Schedule shall be construed as an admission or
indication that such item or other matter is material or that such item or
other matter is required to be referred to or disclosed in this Agreement.
Without limiting the foregoing, no such reference to or disclosure of a
possible breach or violation of any Contract, Applicable Law or order of any
Governmental Body shall be construed as an admission or indication that breach
or violation exists or has actually occurred.
