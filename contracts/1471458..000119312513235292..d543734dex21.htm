-3-  ARTICLE IV

_Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock;_

_Exchange of Certificates _

4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the " _Shares_ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i)
Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each case not held on
behalf of third parties, (ii) Shares as otherwise agreed to in writing before
the Effective Time between Parent or its Affiliates and the holder of such
Shares, (iii) Shares owned by stockholders who have not voted in favor of
adoption of this Agreement or consented thereto in writing and who have
properly demanded and not withdrawn a demand for appraisal pursuant to Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") with respect to such Shares
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ", and together with the Shares referred to in the
immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii), the " _Excluded Shares_ ") and
(iv) Shares that are subject to Company RSUs, Company DSUs, or Company PSUs,
which are governed by the provisions of Section 4.3(b) and (c)) shall be
converted into the right to receive $42.00 per Share in cash (the " _Per Share
Merger Consideration_ "), without interest. At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ",
it being understood that any references herein to a " _Certificate_ " or "
_Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include references, as applicable, to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of Shares where
appropriate) formerly representing any of the Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration for each such Share, without interest.

(b)  _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of the Excluded
Share, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist, subject to any rights the
holder thereof may have under Section 4.2(g).

(c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with a paying agent selected by Parent with
the Companys prior approval (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) (the " _Paying_

 



-4-    _Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) and pursuant to a paying agent agreement in customary form, cash in
immediately available funds in the aggregate amount necessary for the Paying
Agent to make the payments contemplated by Section 4.1(a) (such cash amount
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting
Stockholder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose
the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled
to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, (i) such Shares shall cease to be Excluded Shares and (ii)
Parent shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent additional
funds in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of Dissenting
Shares for which such Dissenting Stockholder has withdrawn its demand for, or
lost its rights to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration. The Paying Agent shall invest the Exchange
Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or a
combination of the foregoing. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the aggregate amount payable pursuant to Section 4.1(a) shall be
returned to the Surviving Corporation in accordance with Section 4.2(e). To
the extent that there are any losses with respect to any such investments, or
the Exchange Fund diminishes for any reason below the level required for the
Paying Agent to make prompt cash payment pursuant to Section 4.1(a), Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
all such cash payments under Section 4.1(a).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within two Business
Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the
Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Record Holder of Shares_ ") (other than
Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to
be in customary form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the
Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(f)) in exchange for the amount to which such
Record Holder of Shares is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to
Section 4.1(a). If any Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares pursuant to
Section 4.2(a), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent
promptly (and in any event within two Business Days) after such Excluded
Shares cease to be Excluded Shares to mail to the applicable Record Holder of
Shares the letter of transmittal and instructions referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such Shares. Upon delivery of
the letter of transmittal duly executed by the applicable Record Holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and the surrender of a Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in Section 4.2(f))
to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal
(or, if such Shares are held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon
the entry through a book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such Shares
on a book-entry account

 



-5-   statement), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal
to the product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(f)) and (y) the
Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or affidavits of loss, as the
case may be. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be
delivered upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

 

(c) _Special Payment Procedures for DTC_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent
and the Company shall cooperate to establish procedures with the Paying Agent
and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ") to ensure that (i) if the Closing
occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (Eastern Time) on the Closing Date, the
Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the Closing Date an
amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the product of (x) the
number of Shares held of record by DTC or such nominee immediately prior to
the Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration (such amount,
the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs after 11:30 a.m.
(Eastern Time) on the Closing Date, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominee on the first Business Day after the Closing Date an amount in
cash in immediately available funds equal to the DTC Payment.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or
the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
amount in cash in immediately available funds to which the holder of the
Certificate is entitled pursuant to this Article IV.

 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed by the stockholders of the Company for nine months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any holder of
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied
with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation
for payment of the amount to which such holder is entitled as a result of the
Merger pursuant to Section 4.1(a) (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) upon due surrender of its
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(f)), without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. All cash paid upon the surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article IV shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates.

 



-6-  (f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as
may be required by Parent or the Paying Agent as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving
effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(h)) equal
to the product of (i) the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(g) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration and Dissenting Stockholders shall instead
be entitled to receive the fair value of their Dissenting Shares as determined
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. At the
Effective Time, the Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Dissenting
Stockholder shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Dissenting
Shares, except the right to receive the fair value of such Dissenting Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any such Dissenting Stockholder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
Dissenting Stockholder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262
of the DGCL, then the right of such Dissenting Stockholder to be paid the fair
value of their Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at
the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the
DGCL received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be
deducted and withheld) from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any other applicable state, local or
foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld (or caused to be
withheld) by the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted by the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the applicable
Governmental Entity and (ii) shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation, or Parent or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be.

 



-7-  4.3. _Treatment of Outstanding Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Company Stock Options_. Except as otherwise agreed to between Parent or
its Affiliates and the holder of a Company Stock Option, at the Effective
Time, each outstanding Company Stock Option, vested or unvested, shall be
cancelled, and in exchange therefor, the holder thereof shall be entitled to
receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to the product of (x)
the total number of Shares subject to the Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time _times_ (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration _over_ the exercise price per Share under such Company
Stock Option, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment; _provided_ that if the exercise price per share of any such
Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Per Share Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash
payment being made in respect thereof.

(b) _Company RSUs and Company DSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed to between
Parent or its Affiliates and the holder of a Company RSU or Company DSU, at
the Effective Time, each outstanding Company RSU and each outstanding Company

therefor, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, at Effective Time,
an amount in cash equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of Company RSUs or Company DSUs, as applicable, cancelled as
provided herein, less applicable Taxes required to be withheld with respect to
such payment. In the event that the immediate payment of the amounts
contemplated above in respect of the Company RSUs or Company DSUs would cause
an impermissible acceleration event under Section 409A of the Code, such
amounts shall become vested at the Effective Time and will be paid at the
earliest time such payment would not cause an impermissible acceleration event
under Section 409A.

(c) _Company PSUs_. Except as otherwise agreed to between Parent or its

Board of Directors of the Company, the Special Committee, and the

other appropriate actions to implement the provisions of this Section 4.3.

(e) _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company changes the number of Shares or securities
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares issued and
outstanding, as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
merger, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per
Share Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change
and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per
Share Merger Consideration.

5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the Company SEC Reports filed or furnished with the SEC and publicly available
at least two calendar days prior to the date of this Agreement and only as and
to the extent disclosed therein (other than any disclosures contained in the
"risk factors", "market risk" or "forward-looking statements" sections thereof
or to the extent they are cautionary, predictive or forward looking in nature)
(it being acknowledged that nothing disclosed in the Company SEC Reports
shall be deemed to be a qualification of, or modification to, the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1(a), 5.1(b), 5.1(c),
5.1(d), 5.1(g)(ii), 5.1(k) and 5.1(t)) or in the corresponding sections or
subsections of the Disclosure Letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior
to or simultaneously with entering into this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of
good standing) under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has
all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and
operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently
conducted and is qualified to do business and is in good standing (with
respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) as a
foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction where the
ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be
so organized, validly existing, qualified, in good standing or to have such
power or authority, would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the certificates of
incorporation (or equivalent formation document) and bylaws (or equivalent
formation document) for the Company and its Subsidiaries, each as amended to
the date of this Agreement, each as so made available is in full force and
effect on the date of this Agreement. The Company and its Subsidiaries are not
in violation of any provision of such organization or governing documents,
except for any violation that would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Capital Structure_. The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 200,000,000 Shares and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.001 per share (the " _Preferred Shares_ "), of which, as of May 21, 2013,
23,444,779 Shares were issued and outstanding and no Preferred Shares were
issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding Shares

 



-9-   have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and

issuance pursuant to the Companys 2009 Omnibus Incentive Plan (the " _2009
Stock Incentive Plan_ ") and the 2003 Ownership Incentive Plan (the " _2003
Stock Incentive Plan_ ") or any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the grant of equity-based awards to directors, officers, employees or
other service providers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares reserved for
issuance. Upon the issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the

and nonassessable. Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a
correct and complete list as of the date of this Agreement of options
outstanding under the Stock Plans, including the holder, number of Shares and

by any Subsidiary of the Company. As of the date hereof, except as set forth
on Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries do not have any Indebtedness (except with respect to clauses
(d) and (e) of the definition of Indebtedness to the extent not otherwise
included in clauses (a), (b), (c), (f) or (g)). Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable

with the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
or the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated

Company Material Adverse Effect.

(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company

contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws

documents required to be filed or furnished by it with the SEC pursuant to the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act (the forms, statements, reports and
documents filed or furnished since the Applicable Date, including any
amendments thereto, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "). Each of the Company SEC
Reports, at the time of its filing or being furnished (or, if amended, as of
the time of such amendment), complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of

 



-12-   the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the

(ii) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule
13a-15 or 15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Such disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in reports filed or submitted under
the Exchange Act, including information relating to its Subsidiaries, (i) is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and (ii) is accumulated and
communicated to the Companys management, including its principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely
decisions regarding disclosure. The Company maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles (" _GAAP_ "). Since the Applicable Date, the Company has disclosed
to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of its internal controls over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that are reasonably likely
to adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the

financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its
date, and each of the consolidated statements of income, stockholders equity
and cash flows included in or incorporated by reference into the Company SEC
Reports (including any related notes and schedules) (such balance

 



-13-   sheets, statements of income, stockholders equity and cash flows, including
any related notes and schedules, collectively, the " _Company Financial
Statements_ ") presents fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows, as the case may be, of the Company and
its consolidated Subsidiaries for the periods set forth therein (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to notes and year-end adjustments none of
which adjustments are expected to be material), in each case, in accordance
with GAAP consistently applied, except as may be noted therein or in the notes
thereto. Since the Applicable Date, the books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries have been, and are being, maintained in all respects in a
manner designed to permit preparation of the Companys financial statements in
accordance, in all material respects, with GAAP.

 

(v) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has or is subject to any
"Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of

has not been any event, change or occurrence that would reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect

(i) There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions, suits, claims,
hearings, arbitrations, investigations or other proceedings (" _Actions_ ")
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened (including cease and
desist letters or invitations to take a patent license) in writing against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, rights
or properties, except those that would not reasonably be expected to have,

reflected or reserved against on a consolidated statement of financial
position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries prepared in
accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto, other than liabilities, commitments

respect to which any obligation to contribute has been undertaken) by the
Company, its Subsidiaries or any entity that would be deemed a "single
employer" with the Company or its Subsidiaries under Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")
on behalf of any employee, director, or other individual service provider of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (whether current, former or retired) or
their beneficiaries, or (ii) with respect to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries has any obligation on behalf of any such employee, director, or

instruments or agreements relating to each Company Plan, including
administrative service agreements and group insurance contracts, and (v) the

(iii) None of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate has
ever contributed to, contributes to, has ever been required to contribute to,
or otherwise participated in or participates in or in any way, directly or
indirectly, has any liability with respect to any plan subject to Section 412
of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA.

(iv) Each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a determination letter from the IRS (or the prototype plan
on which such

 



-15-   Company Plan is based has received an opinion letter from the IRS) upon
which it may rely regarding its qualified status under the Code, such letter
or opinion has not been revoked and nothing has occurred, whether by action
or by failure to act, that caused or could cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material liability. All payments
required by each Company Plan or by Law (including all contributions,
insurance premiums or intercompany charges) with respect to all prior periods
have been made or provided for by the Company or its Subsidiaries in
accordance with the provisions of each of the Company Plans, applicable Law
and GAAP.

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, each Company Plan complies in form and has been

such "prohibited transaction" with respect to the Company Plans is reasonably
expected to occur as a result of any action or inaction by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any third party. No
Company Plan is under, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries

of Labor or any other Governmental Entity, and no such completed audit, if
any, has resulted in the imposition of any material liability.

to any payment or compensation under any Company Plan to or (ii) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due to any Employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(whether current, former or retired) or their beneficiaries. No amount that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as
a result of the consummation of the Merger by any Employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries under any Company Plan or otherwise would not be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or would be subject to an
excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code.

per Share at least equal to the fair market value of one Share on the date of

necessary to conduct their businesses as presently conducted or to lease or
operate their properties, and all Permits of the Company are in full force
and effect and no cancellation or suspension of any Permit is pending, except

similar anti-takeover statute or regulation enacted under state or federal

to any Person if such information was not previously made available to
Parent, and (ii) the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with such Person, in each case of clauses

good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable law and (y) prior to taking any action described in clauses (i) or
(ii) above, the Special Committee has determined in good faith (after
consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) that such
Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could

occurrence of the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives may continue to engage in the activities
described in Section 6.2(a) with respect to any Excluded Party until 11:59

Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee, if applicable) shall not

after Parent requests in writing that the Company Recommendation be reaffirmed
publicly (provided that Parent will be entitled to make such a written

withhold, withdraw or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation, (C) take any formal action or make any recommendation or
public statement in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other

and listen" communication by the Board of Directors of the Company (or the
Special Committee, if applicable) pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange
Act or (D) authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise) an Acquisition Proposal (actions described in this
clause (i) being referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_
"), (ii) authorize, cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement or (iii) terminate this

set forth in this Agreement, prior to the time the Company Stockholder
Approvals are obtained, but not after, the Board of Directors of the Company
(or the Special Committee, if applicable) may make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change with respect to an Acquisition Proposal so long as the
Company is not in material violation of this Section 6.2 or the Company may
(at the direction of the Special Committee) terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 8.3(a), in each case, if the Special Committee has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, (x) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that in
each case, (1) the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special
Committee, if applicable) has given Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the identity of the Person who made such Superior Proposal and all of
the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach the
most current version of the relevant transaction agreement, and, if
applicable, copies of all relevant documents relating thereto including any
related financing commitments), (2) the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent during such notice period, to
the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions
to the terms of this Agreement and the Financing Letters such that it would
cause such Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, and
(3) following the end of such notice period, the Special Committee shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to this Agreement and the Financing
Letters offered in writing by Parent in a manner that would form a binding
contract if accepted by the Company, 

 



-35-   and shall have determined that the Superior Proposal would continue to
constitute a Superior Proposal if such revisions were to be given effect;
_provided_ , that in the event that the Acquisition Proposal to which this
provision applies is thereafter modified in any material respect by the party
making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall provide written notice of
such modified Acquisition Proposal to Parent and shall again comply with this
Section 6.2(d) and provide Parent with an additional two (2) Business Days
notice prior to effecting any Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
effecting a termination pursuant to Section 8.3(a) (and shall do so for each
such subsequent modification).

(e) _Company Adverse Recommendation Change for Intervening
Event_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, prior to the time
the Company Stockholder Approvals are obtained, but not after, the Board of
Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee, if applicable) may effect
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change involving the actions contemplated by
clauses (i)(A) and (i)(B) of Section 6.2(d) in response to an event, change,
effect, development, condition or occurrence (an " _Intervening Event_ ") that
affects or would be reasonably likely to affect (x) the business, financial
condition or continuing results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (y) the stockholders of the Company, in
either case that is (1) material, individually or in the aggregate with any
other such events, changes, effects, developments, conditions or occurrences,
(2) does not relate to an Acquisition Proposal, (3) does not relate to the
fact, in each case in and of itself, that the Company meets or exceeds any
internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates of its revenue,
earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for any
period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after the date of this
Agreement in the market price or trading volume of the Shares or the credit
rating of the Company and (4) is not known to or reasonably foreseeable by (or
the material consequences of which are not known or reasonably foreseeable
by) the Special Committee as of the date hereof, if the Special Committee has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law and prior to taking
such action, (A) the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special
Committee, if applicable) has given Parent at least three (3) Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action and a description
of the reasons for taking such action, (B) the Company has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, with Parent during such notice
period, to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate, to enable Parent to revise
the terms of this Agreement and the Financing Letters in such a manner that
would obviate the need for taking such action and (C) following the end of
such notice period, the Special Committee shall have considered in good faith
any revisions to this Agreement and the Financing Letters offered in writing
by Parent in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company, and shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to effect such
Company Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that if the
Intervening Event to which this provision applies thereafter changes in any
material respect or another Intervening Event occurs, the Company shall
provide written notice of such modified or other Intervening Event to Parent
and shall again comply with this Section 6.2(e) and provide Parent with an
additional two (2) Business Days notice prior to effecting any Company
Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



-36-  (f) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the
Company or any committee thereof from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
stockholders), or (ii) making any "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the
stockholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the
Exchange Act (or any similar communications to the stockholders of the
Company); _provided_ that the foregoing shall in no way eliminate or modify
the effect that any such disclosure would otherwise have under this Agreement.

 

(g) _Notice_. Within two (2) Business Days following the No-Shop Period Start
Date, the Company shall notify Parent of the number and identity of any
Excluded Parties and provide Parent with a written summary of the material
terms and conditions of the most recent Acquisition Proposal (and which form
the basis for a determination that the applicable person qualifies as an
Excluded Party) received from any such Excluded Party. From and after the No-
Shop Period Start Date, the Company agrees that (i) it will promptly (and, in
any event, within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if (x)
any Acquisition Proposal is received by it or any of its Representatives
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making
the Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions thereof
(including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation constituting
the Acquisition Proposal, including proposed Alternative Acquisition
Agreements and any related financing commitments) and (y) any non-public
information is requested from, or any discussions or negotiations are sought
to be initiated with, it or any of its Representatives in connection with a
potential Acquisition Proposal, indicating, in connection with such notice,
the identity of the Person seeking such information or discussions
or negotiations, and in each case, thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably
informed of the status of any such discussions or negotiations, and (ii) in
the event that any such party modifies its Acquisition Proposal in any
material respect, the Company shall notify Parent within twenty-four (24)
hours after receipt of such modified Acquisition Proposal of the fact that
such Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of such modification
(including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation reflecting
such modification); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the requirements
contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) shall apply (x) during the
Go-Shop Period or (y) before the Excluded Party Deadline to any Acquisition
Proposal submitted by an Excluded Party or any modification thereof. The
Company agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
enter into any confidentiality agreement subsequent to the date hereof which
prohibits the Company from providing to Parent such material terms and
conditions and other information.

 

6.3. _Stockholders Meeting; Proxy Statement and Schedule 13E-3_.

(including any adjournment or postponement thereof, the "
_Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approvals, as soon as

 



-37-   reasonably practicable after the SEC confirms that it has no further
comments on the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3. Subject to Section 6.2, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approvals. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, that the Company may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders
Meeting (i) with the consent of Parent, (ii) for the absence of a quorum,
(iii) to allow reasonable additional time for any supplemental or amended
disclosure which the Company has determined in good faith (after consultation

such supplemental or amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by
the Companys stockholders prior to the Stockholders Meeting or (iv) to allow
additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Company Stockholder
Approvals. 

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the execution of this
Agreement (and in any event within twenty (20) Business Days after the date
hereof), the Company shall prepare the Proxy Statement and file it with the
SEC and the Company and Parent shall jointly prepare and file the Schedule
13E-3 with the SEC and the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other
in connection with the preparation of the foregoing. Prior to filing or
mailing the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3 (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments on such document or response and shall include any such comments
reasonably proposed by Parent. The Company (and Parent, as applicable) shall
use reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably practicable
to and resolve all comments received from the SEC or its staff concerning the
Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and shall cause the Proxy Statement to
be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after the
date on which the SEC confirms it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement and shall establish the record date as soon as reasonably
practicable after such confirmation from the SEC (if not
already established); provided, that the Company shall be under no obligation
to mail the Proxy Statement to its stockholders prior to the No-Shop Period
Start Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any other government officials and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government officials for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 and
shall supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or
any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any
other government officials, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy
Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation and filing of
the Proxy Statement and the Schedule 13E-3, including furnishing as promptly
as reasonably practicable to the Company in writing upon request any and all
information relating to it as may be required to be set forth in the Proxy
Statement or Schedule 13E-3 under applicable Law. Parent agrees that such

to the Schedule 13E-3, when it is filed with the SEC, contain any untrue

overturned) any Order that results from any stockholder litigation against the
Company or its Subsidiaries, Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
respective directors or officers relating to this Agreement, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall give
Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not control, the defense or
settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company or its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers relating to this
Agreement, the Merger or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and no such settlement, or other compromise or arrangement, of any

event within 48 hours) of the commencement of any such stockholder or
derivative suit, action, litigation or claim of which it has received notice
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or, to the Knowledge of the Company and/or Parent,
threatened in writing, against the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and/or the
members of the Board of Directors of the Company.

in this Agreement, including Section 6.5(d) below and subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and

 



-39-   to the extent reasonably practicable each will consult with the other on and
consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the
information relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of
their respective Affiliates, that appears in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in

this Agreement, including Section 6.5(d), the Company and Parent each shall,
upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information concerning

matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the
Proxy Statement, the Schedule 13E-3 or any other statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
in connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law.

transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries, from any
Governmental Entity with respect to such approvals. Neither the Company nor
Parent shall permit any of its Subsidiaries, officers or any
other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with respect

Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

(A) as soon as practicable, and in any event, no later than 15 Business Days
following the date of this Agreement (assuming timely receipt of all
information required from the Company or Parent, as applicable), to file the
initial pre-merger notifications with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein required under the HSR Act (which filing,
including the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to
the other party except to the extent reasonably necessary to outside counsel
of each party in the event of an investigation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by a Governmental Entity) for each
of

 



-40-   Parent and the Company, in each case, requesting early termination of the
waiting period with respect to the Merger and to file as soon as reasonably
practicable any notification or other form necessary to obtain any consents,
clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any other
Antitrust Law;

(B) to promptly provide to each and every federal, state, local or foreign
court or Governmental Entity with jurisdiction over enforcement of any
applicable Antitrust Law (a " _Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") non-
privileged information and documents requested by any such Governmental
Antitrust Entity in connection with obtaining any such approval of such
Governmental Antitrust Entity that is necessary, proper or advisable
to permit consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby;

(C) to use reasonable best efforts to take, and to cause each of its
Subsidiaries to take, any and all actions necessary to obtain any consents,
clearances or approvals required under or in connection with any Antitrust
Law, enable all waiting periods under any Antitrust Law to expire and avoid
or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law asserted by any
Governmental Entity, in each case, to enable the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby to occur prior to the Termination
Date, including promptly complying with or modifying any requests for
additional information (including any second request) by any Governmental
Entity; and

(D) to refrain from entering into any agreement, arrangement or other
understanding to acquire any assets or properties that would prevent or
materially delay receipt of any Company Required Governmental Approvals or
Parent Required Governmental Approvals or prevent, materially delay or
materially impede the Closing.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
none of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be obliged to take or
accept (or commit to take or accept), and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary shall take or accept (or commit to take or accept), without
Parents prior consent, any action or any condition, restriction, obligation
or requirement with respect to Parent, the Company, their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates or their Subsidiaries or Affiliates assets if such action,
condition, restriction, obligation or requirement, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected (A) to materially prohibit
or materially restrict the ability of Parent or any of its Affiliates
effectively to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership (including
with respect to voting) of the Shares to be acquired in the Merger or of the
assets or business of the Company, (B) to be materially adverse to the assets
or businesses, the operation of the businesses or the financial condition or
results of operations, of the Parent (including, for these purposes, the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole, or (C) to be
materially adverse to the assets or businesses, the operation of the
businesses, or the financial condition or results of operations of the
Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

(iii) Neither the Company nor Parent will withdraw its initial filing under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be, and refile it
unless the Company

 



-41-   or Parent, as applicable, has consented in advance to such withdrawal and
refiling. Nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent, the Company or their
respective Affiliates to take or agree to take any action with respect to its
business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or action is
conditioned upon the Closing.

6.6. _Access and Reports_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other authorized
Representatives, including financing sources, reasonable access, during normal
business hours throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its
employees, properties, books, Contracts and records, and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent and its Representatives information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested (including
providing Parent with monthly financial reports to the extent available and
prepared in the ordinary course); _provided_ that Parent and its
representatives shall conduct any such activities in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of the Company. All
requests for information made pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be directed
to the executive officer or other Persons designated by the Company. All such
information shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.
No investigation pursuant to this Section 6.6 or by Parent or its
Representatives at any time prior to or following the date of this Agreement
shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty made by the
Company herein.

(b) This Section 6.6 shall not require the Company or its Subsidiaries to
permit any access, or to disclose any information that, in the reasonable,
good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel) of the Company,
is reasonably likely to result in any violation of any Law or any Contract to
which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or cause attorney-client
privilege that the Company or its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to
be undermined with respect to such information and such undermining of such
privilege could in the Companys good faith judgment (after consultation with
outside counsel) adversely affect in any material respect the Companys
position in any pending or, what the Company believes in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) could be, future litigation; _provided_ ,
_that_ , the parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to allow
disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (A) would not (in the
good faith belief of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel)) be
reasonably likely to result in the violation of any such Law or Contract or be
reasonably likely to cause such attorney-client privilege to be undermined
with respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith
belief of the Company (after consultation with outside counsel)) be managed
through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-
employee Representatives of Parent could be provided access to such
information.

(c) The information provided pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall be used
solely for the purpose of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby, and such information shall be kept confidential by Parent and Merger
Sub in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be subject to the
terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

 



-42-  6.7. _Stock Exchange De-listing_. Each of the Company and Parent shall take
such actions reasonably required to cause the Companys securities to be de-
listed from the Nasdaq and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.

 

6.8. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company.
Thereafter, unless and until a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has
occurred or except in connection with a Company Adverse Recommendation Change,
so long as this Agreement is in effect, the Company and Parent each
shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press releases or
otherwise making public announcements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings
with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity (including any national
securities exchange or interdealer quotation service) with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law or by the fiduciary duties of the members of
the Board of Directors of the Company (or the Special Committee, as
applicable) or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules
of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or by the
request of any Governmental Entity.

 

6.9. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Parent agrees that, during the period commencing at the Effective Time and
ending on the first anniversary thereof, employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time ("
_Affected Employees_ ") will be provided with (i) with respect to each
Affected Employee, except as otherwise agreed between an Affected Employee
and Parent or its Affiliates, base salary and annual cash bonus opportunities
(but excluding long-term incentive opportunities and equity-based
arrangements) which are no less than the base salary and annual cash
bonus opportunities provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries to each such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) with respect
to Affected Employees in the aggregate, other employee benefits and
perquisites that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those
benefits (excluding equity-based incentives, defined benefit pension plans and
post-employment welfare benefits) provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries
under a Company Plan to each such Affected Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (iii) severance benefits that are no less favorable than
the severance benefits provided by the Company and its Subsidiaries under a
Company Plan set forth on Section 5.1(i)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter
in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice to each such
Affected Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time _._

 

(b) Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans which the Affected Employees
are entitled to participate in after the Effective Time to take into account
for purposes of eligibility, vesting, level of benefits and benefit accrual
(but not for benefit accrual purposes under any qualified defined benefit
pension plan) thereunder, service for the Company and its Subsidiaries as if
such service were with Parent, to the same extent such service was credited
under a corresponding Company Plan (except to the extent it would result in a
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of service). Parent
shall, and shall cause its direct and

 



-43-   indirect Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation) to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and all waiting periods
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Affected Employee under any welfare benefit plan in which an Affected Employee
is eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time and (ii) credit each
Affected Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket
expenses paid prior to the Effective Time under the terms of any corresponding
Company Plan in satisfying any applicable deductible, co-payment or out-of-
pocket requirements for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs
under any welfare benefit plan in which the Affected Employee participates on
and after the Effective Time, in each case, to the same extent that such
exclusions and waiting periods were waived and such co-payments,
deductibles and other expenses were credited under a corresponding Company
Plan (except to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits).

(c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor
thereto to honor, assume, fulfill and discharge the Companys and its
Subsidiaries obligations under all of the Company Plans in accordance with
the terms and conditions thereof.

(d) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in
this Section 6.9 are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and
shall not create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any other
Person. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, (i) shall constitute
an amendment to any Company Plan or (ii) shall limit the ability of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation to
terminate the employment or service of any Employee (including
Affected Employees) or amend or terminate any Company Plan pursuant to its
terms.

6.10. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5, whether or not
the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expense except expenses
incurred in connection with Parents indemnification and reimbursement
obligations pursuant to Section 6.14(b).

6.11. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted

fullest extent permitted under applicable Law upon receipt of a request
therefor (accompanied by invoices or other relevant documentation), each
present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Costs_
") incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or related to such Indemnified Parties service as a director
or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such
Persons at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i)
the Merger and the

 



-44-   other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) actions to
enforce this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of
any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that the Person to whom Costs are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such Costs if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time to
obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies that are
reasonably satisfactory to the Company for acts or omissions occurring prior
to the Effective Time for the extension of (i) the directors and officers
liability coverage of the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies for the Indemnified Parties, and (ii) the Companys
existing fiduciary liability insurance policy, in each case for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys insurance carrier as of the date of this Agreement
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits, terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage that are no less favorable to
the Indemnified Parties as the Companys existing policies with respect to any
matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective Time (including
in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving
Corporation be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence
an aggregate premium in excess of 600% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such insurance. If the Parent for any reason fail to obtain
such "tail" insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six years from and
after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of this
Agreement with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are no less favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or the Surviving
Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use
reasonable best efforts purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six-year
period with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and levels of coverage
that are no less favorable to the insureds as provided in the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; and _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.11.

 



-45-  (d) The provisions of this Section 6.11 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, who are third
party beneficiaries of this Section 6.11.

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.11 shall be in
addition to any rights such Indemnified Parties may have under the certificate
of incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable Contracts or Laws. All
rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favor of any
Indemnified Party as provided in the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any
indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party.

 

6.12. _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and Parent shall each grant such approvals and take such actions as
are necessary under such Takeover Statute so that such transactions
contemplated hereby may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such Law on this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.13. _Parent Vote_.

(a) Parent shall vote (or consent with respect to) or cause to be voted (or a
consent to be given with respect to) any Shares beneficially owned by it or
any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
has the power (by agreement, proxy or otherwise) to cause to be voted (or to
provide a consent), in favor of the adoption of this Agreement at any meeting
of stockholders of the Company at which this Agreement shall be submitted for
adoption and at all adjournments or postponements thereof (or, if applicable,
by any action of stockholders of the Company by consent in lieu of a
meeting).

(b) Immediately following the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall
execute and deliver, in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL and in its
capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, a written consent adopting
this Agreement.

 

6.14. _Financing_.

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper or advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing described in the
Financing Letters on the terms and conditions described therein and shall not
permit any amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under the Financing Letters that imposes new or
additional conditions, in each case, that would reasonably be expected to (I)
reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt

 



-46-   Financing (including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Debt Financing (except as set forth in any "flex" terms)
unless the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount), (II)
delay or prevent the availability of the Financing or (III) make the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt
Financing) less likely to occur (it being understood and agreed that Parent
and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Commitment Letter to add lenders, arrangers,
bookrunners, agents, managers or similar entities that have not executed the
Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement), including using
reasonable best efforts (i) to maintain in effect the Financing Letters until
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) to negotiate
and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letter on the terms and conditions (including the flex provisions) contained
in the Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms no less favorable, in all material
respects, to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions (including
the flex provisions) in the Debt Commitment Letter), (iii) to satisfy (or
obtain waivers to) on a timely basis (taking into account the expected timing
of the Marketing Period) all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger Sub to
funding in the Debt Commitment Letter at the Closing that are within its
control and in the Equity Financing Commitment Letter and to consummate the
Financing at or prior to the Closing, including using its reasonable best
efforts (including through litigation pursued in good faith) to cause the
lenders and the other Persons committing to fund the Financing to fund the
Financing at the Closing, (iv) to enforce its rights under the Financing
Letters (including through litigation pursued in good faith) and (v) to
comply with its obligations under the Financing Letters. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company
prompt notice (x) of any breach or default by any party to any of
the Financing Letters and any definitive agreements with respect thereto of
which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, if such breach or default would
result in a material delay of, or in any way limit, the availability of the
Financing, (y) of the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written
communication, in each case from any Debt Financing Source with respect to any
(1) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by any
party to any of the Financing Letters and any definitive agreements with
respect thereto or any material provisions of the Financing Letters and any
definitive agreements with respect thereto or (2) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to any of the Financing Letters
with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the
Financing to be funded at Closing, in each case which would make the funding
of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Debt Financing) less likely to occur or materially delay the availability of
the Debt Financing, and (z) if for any reason Parent or Merger Sub believes in
good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by any
of the Financing Letters or definitive document related to the Financing. As
soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two Business Days
after the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written
request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in clause
(x), (y) or (z) of the immediately preceding sentence. Upon the occurrence of
any circumstance referred to in clause (x), (y)(A) or (z) of the second
preceding sentence which would make any portion of the Debt Financing
unavailable, and such portion is reasonably required to fund the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration and all fees, expenses and other amounts
contemplated to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to this Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub 

 



-47-   shall use their reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain in replacement
thereof alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on terms and
conditions not materially less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the
terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as promptly as reasonably
practicable following the occurrence of such event. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required pursuant to this Agreement to agree to pay to the lenders providing
the Debt Financing any additional fees or to increase any interest rates
applicable to the Debt Financing, except as expressly required pursuant to the
Debt Commitment Letter in existence as of the date hereof or in any fee letter
referenced therein (including any market flex terms thereof) or related
thereto and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to consummate the
Debt Financing until the final day of the Marketing Period. Parent shall keep
the Company informed on a reasonably current basis in reasonable detail of the
status of its efforts to arrange the Financing. For purposes of this
Agreement, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the alternate
financing as permitted by this Section 6.14(a) and "Debt Commitment Letters"
shall include such documents related to the alternative financing as
permitted by this Section 6.14(a).

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide to Parent and Merger Sub, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
to use its reasonable best efforts to provide, and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its Representatives, including legal and accounting, to
provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent and Merger Sub in
connection with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Financing and causing
the conditions in the Financing Letters to be satisfied, including
using reasonable best efforts in (i) assisting with the preparation of
Offering Documents and assisting in the preparation of the pro forma financial
statements referred to in paragraphs 9 and 11 of the Exhibit E of the Debt
Commitment Letter, (ii) preparing and furnishing to Parent, Merger Sub and
the Debt Financing Sources as promptly as practicable all Required Information
and all other available pertinent information and disclosures relating to the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including their businesses, operations,
financial projections and prospects) as may be reasonably requested by Parent
to assist in preparation of the Offering Documents, and any supplements
thereto, (iii) having the Company designate members of senior management of
the Company to participate in a reasonable number of presentations, road
shows, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, customary meetings and
sessions with ratings agencies in connection with the Financing and
reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts, including direct contact
between such senior management of the Company and its Subsidiaries and Debt
Financing Sources and potential lenders and investors in the Financing, (iv)
assisting Parent in obtaining any corporate credit and family ratings from
any ratings agencies contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, including
assisting Parent, Merger Sub and the Debt Financing Sources in the preparation
of materials for rating agency presentations, (v) requesting the Companys
independent auditors to cooperate with Parents reasonable best efforts to
obtain accountants comfort letters and consents from the Companys
independent auditors, (vi) assisting in the preparation of, and executing and
delivering, definitive financing documents, including guarantee and collateral
documents and other certificates and documents as may be reasonably requested
by Parent, (vii) subject to any contractual agreement in effect, facilitating

mutually agreed with the Company; provided, however, that such logos are used
solely in a manner that is not intended, or reasonably likely, to harm or
disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The Company will, upon
request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to periodically update any
Required Information (to the extent it is available) to be included in any
Offering Document to be used in connection with such Financing so that Parent
may ensure that such Required Information, when taken as a whole, does not
contain as of the time provided, giving effect to any supplements, any untrue
statement of material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading.

(c) In no event shall Parent, directly or indirectly, (i) award any agent,
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other firm or Person any
financial advisory role on an exclusive basis, or (ii) engage any bank or

Subsidiaries), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) in connection with the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the

conditions set forth in Article VII.

required to be paid to fully satisfy all principal, interest, prepayment
premiums, penalties, breakage costs or similar obligations related to any
borrowings under the Credit Facility as of the anticipated Effective Date (and
the daily accrual thereafter) (the "Payoff Amount"), (ii) state that upon
receipt of the Payoff Amount, the Credit Facility and related instruments
evidencing the Credit Facility shall be terminated, and (iii) state that all
Liens and all guarantees in connection therewith relating to the assets and
properties of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries securing such Borrowings
shall be, upon the payment of the Payoff Amount on the Effective Date,

to take the actions set forth on Section 6.14(e) of the Company Disclosure

Agreement, dated November 19, 2012 among the Company and Apax Partners, L.P.
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), which Confidentiality Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms; provided that
the execution of this Agreement by the Company shall constitute written
consent by the Company pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement to all
actions by Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company agrees that Apax Partners,
L.P. and Apax Partners LLP are express third party beneficiaries of each
waiver to, or amendment of, the Confidentiality Agreement contained herein or
contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the Company agrees that the Confidentiality
Agreement is hereby amended to permit, subject to the terms of the

investors, co-bidders, financing sources, outside agents and other advisors
permitted under this Agreement in the term "Representative" as such term is
defined therein.

6.16. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the
discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would
reasonably be expected to cause or result in any of the conditions to the
Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied or satisfaction of those
conditions being materially delayed in violation of any provision of this
Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 6.16 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-compliance with,
any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the remedies available to
the party receiving such notice.

 

6.17. _Subsidiary Conversion_. The Company agrees it shall, at the request of
Parent, use its commercially reasonable efforts to convert the form of
corporate entity of any of its Subsidiaries to be effective at the Closing,
_provided_ , _that_ the Company shall not be obligated to take any actions
which are not, or the effect of which are not, contingent upon the Closing.

6.18. _Lease Consents_. Prior to the Closing, at the request of Parent, the
Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consent under
any lease or sublease to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party to
the extent required so that no default (or right of termination) exists or
arises thereunder in connection with or as a result of or following the
Merger; provided that the Company or its Subsidiaries may not make any
payments, or alter the terms of any such lease or sublease without obtaining
the prior consent of Parent which will not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

6.19. _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, except as otherwise may be
agreed by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent the resignation of all
of the members of the Board of Directors of the Company who are in office
immediately prior to the Effective Time (and to the extent requested by
Parent, from any member of the board of directors (or any equivalent) of each
Subsidiary of the Company), which resignations shall be effective at the
Effective Time.

 



-51-  6.20. _FIRPTA Affidavit_. On or prior to the Closing, if it is legally
permissible to do so, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Parent, duly executed and
acknowledged, certifying any facts that would exempt the transactions
contemplated hereby from withholding under Section 1445 of the Code.

otherwise) in the aggregate in excess of the amount of the Parent Termination
Fee (less any portion thereof that has been paid) plus any expense
reimbursement pursuant to Section 6.14(b), and the amount of the Parent
Termination Fee and such expense reimbursement shall be the maximum aggregate
liability of Parent and Merger Sub hereunder (and of the Investors under the
Equity Financing Commitment Letter and Termination Equity Commitment Letter,
collectively) and in no event shall the

 



-58-   Company (or any other Person) seek or be entitled to multiple, special or
punitive damages against the Parent Related Parties, or any recovery, judgment
or damages of any kind against the Parent Related Parties (other than against
an Investor under the Termination Equity Commitment Letter).

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledge that the agreements contained in
this Section 8.5 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that without these agreements, the other parties would not
enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case
may be, fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.5,
and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, commences an action which results in a judgment against the other party
with respect to the payment by such party set forth in this Section 8.5, such
paying party shall pay the other party or parties, as applicable, its
reasonable and documented costs and expenses (including reasonable
and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment. 

ARTICLE IX

_Miscellaneous and General_

9.1. _Survival_. This Article IX and the agreements of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub contained in Article IV and Sections 6.9 ( _Employee Benefits_
), 6.10 ( _Expenses_ ), 6.11 ( _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers
Insurance_) and the indemnification and reimbursement obligations of Parent
pursuant to 6.14(b) ( _Financing_ ) shall survive the consummation of the
Merger. All other representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in
this Agreement shall not survive the consummation of the Merger.

9.2. _Modification or Amendment_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement, by written agreement of
the parties hereto, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors
(in the case of the Company, acting upon the direction of the Special
Committee); _provided_ that after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approvals or the adoption of this Agreement by the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, if any such amendment or waiver shall by applicable Law require further
approval of the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, as applicable, the effectiveness of such amendment shall be subject to
the approval of the stockholders of the Company or the sole stockholder of
Merger Sub, as applicable.

 

9.3. _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties

and may be waived by such party (in the case of the Company, by the Company at
the direction of the Special Committee) in whole or in part to the extent
permitted by applicable Laws. Any such extension or waiver shall only
be valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or
parties to be bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any rights or
remedies shall not constitute a waiver of such rights or remedies.

 



-59-  9.4. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original
instrument, and all such counterparts shall together constitute one and the
same agreement.

9.5. _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS SHALL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the personal jurisdiction of the
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or to the extent such court does
not have subject matter jurisdiction, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in respect of
the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this Agreement and of
the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert,
as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not subject thereto or
that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable
in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate, or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by such Chosen Courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such action, suit or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts; provided that
notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, no party hereto,
nor any of its Affiliates, will bring, or support, any claim, whether at law
or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Debt
Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out
of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof, anywhere other than in (i) any New York State court sitting in the
Borough of Manhattan or (ii) the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such Chosen
Court jurisdiction over the person of such parties and, to the extent
permitted by Law, over the subject matter of such dispute and agree that
mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such action, suit
or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 9.6 or in such other manner as
may be permitted by law shall be valid, effective and sufficient service
thereof.

 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY ACTION,
SUIT OR PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO 

 



-60-   THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT
(INCLUDING THE DEBT FINANCING). EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i)
NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF SUCH
ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH
PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii)
EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED
TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.5.

 

(c) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that the parties hereto do not perform their obligations under the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with
its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Subject to the
following sentence, the parties acknowledge and agree that prior to the valid
termination of this Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, (i) the parties
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in the Chosen Courts without
proof of damages or otherwise, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled under this Agreement, (ii) the provisions set forth in
Section 8.5 are not intended to and do not adequately compensate for the harm
that would result from a breach of this Agreement and shall not be construed
to diminish or otherwise impair in any respect any partys right to specific
enforcement and (iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is explicitly agreed that the right of the
Company to seek an injunction, specific performance or other equitable
remedies in connection with enforcing Parents obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded to fund the Merger shall be subject to the requirements
that (i) the Marketing Period has ended and all conditions in Section 7.1 and
7.2 were satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be
satisfied by actions taken at Closing) at the time when the Closing would have
been required to occur but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded and continue to be satisfied and Parent and Merger Sub fail to complete
the Closing by the date that Closing is required to occur pursuant to Section
1.2, (ii) the Debt Financing (including any alternative financing that has
been obtained in accordance with, and satisfies the conditions of, Section
6.14(a) of this Agreement) has been funded in accordance with the terms
thereof or will be funded in accordance with the terms thereof at the Closing
if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing, and (iii) the Company has
confirmed that if the Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded, then it
would take such actions that are within its control to cause the Closing to
occur. Each of the parties hereto agrees that it will not oppose the granting
of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis
that (x) the other parties hereto have an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity (the " _Prohibited Defenses_ "). The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to 

 



-61-   prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Section 9.5(c) shall not
be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, while a party may pursue both a grant of
specific performance in accordance with Section 9.5(c) and the payment of any
applicable termination fee, damages and/or expense reimbursement, as
applicable, under no circumstances shall any party be permitted or entitled to
receive both a grant of specific performance and any such payments.

9.6. _Notices_. Any notice, request, instruction or other document to be
given hereunder by any party to the others shall be in writing and delivered

respect to the subject matter hereof.

9.8. _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except (i) as provided in Section 6.11 (
_Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_), (ii) with respect to

hereto further agree that the rights of third party beneficiaries under
Section 6.11 shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with Section 9.3
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently,
Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the representations
and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or
circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

 



-63-  9.9. _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to
include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. 

9.10. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation, or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

9.11. _Definitions_. Each of the terms set forth in _Annex A_ is defined as

9.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions of Article VIII, including
the remedies, and limitations thereon, be construed as integral provisions of
this Agreement and that such provisions, remedies and limitations shall not
be severable in any manner that diminishes a partys rights hereunder or
increases a partys liability or obligations hereunder or under the Equity
Financing Commitments.

 

9.13. _Interpretation; Construction_.

(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed to
limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference in
this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." All
pronouns and all variations thereof shall be deemed to refer to the masculine,
feminine or neuter, singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may
require. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to any agreement
(including this Agreement), contract, statute or regulation, such references
are to, except as context may otherwise require, the agreement, contract,
statute or regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced
from time to time (in the case of an agreement or contract, to the extent
permitted by the terms thereof); and to any section of any statute
or regulation including any successor to the section and, in the case of any
statute, any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to
"dollars" or "$" in this Agreement are to United States dollars. All
references to "days" shall be to calendar days unless otherwise indicated as

-64-  (b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

(c) Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its
respective disclosure letter (each, a " _Disclosure Letter_ ") in a section
thereof that corresponds to the section of this Agreement to which it relates.
The mere inclusion of any item in any section or subsection of any partys
Disclosure Letter as an exception to any representation or warranty or
otherwise shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the applicable
party, or to otherwise imply, that any such item has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect or otherwise represents
an exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the purposes of this
Agreement, or that such item meets or exceeds a monetary or other threshold
specified for disclosure in this Agreement. Matters disclosed in any section
or subsection of a partys Disclosure Letter are not necessarily limited to
matters that are required by this Agreement to be disclosed therein. Such
additional matters are set forth for informational purposes only and do not
necessarily include other matters of a similar nature or impose any duty or
obligation to disclose any information beyond what is required by this
Agreement, and disclosure of such additional matters shall not affect,
directly or indirectly, the interpretation of this Agreement or the scope of
the disclosure obligations hereunder. Headings inserted in the sections or
subsections of any partys Disclosure Letter are for convenience of reference
only and shall not have the effect of amending or changing the express terms
of the sections or subsections as set forth in this Agreement.

9.14.  _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors, legal
representatives and permitted assigns. No party to this Agreement may assign
any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement, by
operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto (in the case of the Company, acting through the Special
Committee). Any purported assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

A-12  EXHIBIT A

_EXHIBIT A_

SURVIVING CORPORATION CHARTER

 

AMENDED AND RESTATED

CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

OF

 

rue21, inc.



 

ARTICLE FIRST: The name of the corporation (which is hereinafter referred to
as the " _Corporation_ ") is rue21, inc. 

ARTICLE SECOND: The name and address of the registered agent in the State of
Delaware is The Corporation Trust Company, 1209 Orange Street, Wilmington,
New Castle County, Delaware 19801.

ARTICLE THIRD: The purpose of the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act
or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _General Corporation Law_ "),
as from time to time amended.

 

ARTICLE FOURTH: The total number of shares of capital stock which the
Corporation shall have authority to issue is 1,000 (ONE THOUSAND), all of
which shares shall be Common Stock having a par value per share of $0.01.

ARTICLE FIFTH: In furtherance and not in limitation of the powers conferred
by law, subject to any limitations contained elsewhere in this certificate of
incorporation, bylaws of the Corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed
by a majority of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, but any bylaws
adopted by the Board of Directors may be amended or repealed by the
stockholders entitled to vote thereon. Election of directors need not be by
written ballot.

 

ARTICLE SIXTH: (a) To the fullest extent permitted by the General Corporation
Law as it now exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior thereto), and
except as otherwise provided in the Corporations Bylaws, no Director of the
Corporation shall be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for
monetary damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty owed to the
Corporation or its stockholders.

 

(b) Any repeal or modification of Section (a) of this Article SIXTH by the
stockholders of the Corporation shall not adversely affect any right or
protection of a

 



Ex. A-1   Director of the Corporation existing at the time of such repeal or
modification with respect to any act, omission or other matter occurring prior
to such repeal or modification.

 

(c) _Right to Indemnification_. Each person who was or is made a party or is
threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved (including
involvement as a witness) in any action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative (a " _proceeding_ "), by reason of
the fact that he or she is or was a Director or officer of the Corporation
or, while a Director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of
another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "
_indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a Director or officer or in any other capacity while
serving as a Director or officer, shall be indemnified and held harmless by
the Corporation to the fullest extent authorized by the General Corporation
Law, as the same exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any
such amendment, only to the extent that such amendment permits the
Corporation to provide broader indemnification rights than permitted prior
thereto), against all expense, liability and loss (including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines, excise taxes or penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred or suffered by such indemnitee in connection therewith and
such indemnification shall continue as to an indemnitee who has ceased to be a
Director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to the benefit of the
indemnitees heirs, executors and administrators; provided, however, that,
except as provided in Section (d) of this Article SIXTH with respect to
proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification, the Corporation
shall indemnify any such indemnitee in connection with a proceeding (or part
thereof) initiated by such indemnitee only if such proceeding (or part
thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. The
right to indemnification conferred in this Section (c) of this Article SIXTH
shall be a contract right and shall include the obligation of the Corporation
to pay the expenses incurred in defending any such proceeding in advance of
its final disposition (an " _advance of expenses_ "); provided, however,
that, if and to the extent that the General Corporation Law requires, an
advance of expenses incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a
Director or officer (and not in any other capacity in which service was or is
rendered by such indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an
employee benefit plan) shall be made only upon delivery to the Corporation of
an undertaking (an " _undertaking_ "), by or on behalf of such indemnitee, to
repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be determined by final
judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal (a " _final
adjudication_ ") that such indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified for
such expenses under this Section (c) or otherwise. The Corporation may, by
action of its Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and
agents of the Corporation with the same or lesser scope and effect as the
foregoing indemnification of Directors and officers.

(d) _Procedure for Indemnification_. Any indemnification of a Director or
officer of the Corporation or advance of expenses under Section (c) of this
Article

 



Ex. A-2   SIXTH shall be made promptly, and in any event within forty five days (or,
in the case of an advance of expenses, twenty days), upon the written request
of the Director or officer. If a determination by the Corporation that the
Director or officer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
SIXTH is required, and the Corporation fails to respond within sixty days to a
written request for indemnity, the Corporation shall be deemed to have
approved the request. If the Corporation denies a written request for
indemnification or advance of expenses, in whole or in part, or if payment in
full pursuant to such request is not made within forty five days (or, in the
case of an advance of expenses, twenty days), the right to indemnification or
advances as granted by this Article SIXTH shall be enforceable by the Director
or officer in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such persons costs and
expenses incurred in connection with successfully establishing his or her
right to indemnification, in whole or in part, in any such action shall also
be indemnified by the Corporation. It shall be a defense to any such action
(other than an action brought to enforce a claim for the advance of expenses
where the undertaking required pursuant to Section (c) of this Article SIXTH,
if any, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met
the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the General
Corporation Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount
claimed, but the burden of such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither
the failure of the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) to have made a determination
prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant
is proper in the circumstances because he or she has met the applicable
standard of conduct set forth in the General Corporation Law, nor an actual
determination by the Corporation (including its Board of Directors,
independent legal counsel or its stockholders) that the claimant has not met
such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or
create a presumption that the claimant has not met the applicable standard of
conduct. The procedure for indemnification of other employees and agents for
whom indemnification is provided pursuant to Section (c) of this
Article SIXTH shall be the same procedure set forth in this Section (d) for
Directors or officers, unless otherwise set forth in the action of the Board
of Directors providing indemnification for such employee or agent.

 

(e) _Insurance_. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on its
own behalf and on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, officer,
employee or agent of the Corporation or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a Director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any
expense, liability or loss asserted against him or her and incurred by him or
her in any such capacity, whether or not the Corporation would have the power
to indemnify such person against such expenses, liability or loss under the
General Corporation Law. 

(f) _Service for Subsidiaries_. Any person serving as a Director, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture or other enterprise, at least 50% of whose equity
interests are owned by the Corporation (a " _subsidiary_ " for this Article
SIXTH) shall be conclusively presumed to be serving in such capacity at the
request of the Corporation.

 



Ex. A-3  (g) _Reliance_. Persons who after the date of the adoption of this provision
become or remain Directors or officers of the Corporation or who, while a
Director or officer of the Corporation, become or remain a Director, officer,
employee or agent of a subsidiary, shall be conclusively presumed to have
relied on the rights to indemnity, advance of expenses and other rights
contained in this Article SIXTH in entering into or continuing such service.
The rights to indemnification and to the advance of expenses conferred in this
Article SIXTH shall apply to claims made against an indemnitee arising out of
acts or omissions which occurred or occur both prior and subsequent to the
adoption hereof.

(h) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights to indemnification and to the
advance of expenses conferred in this Article SIXTH shall not be exclusive of
any other right which any person may have or hereafter acquire under this
Restated Certificate or under any statute, by law, agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested Directors or otherwise.

(i) _Merger or Consolidation_. For purposes of this Article SIXTH, references
to the "Corporation" shall include, in addition to the resulting Corporation,
any constituent Corporation (including any constituent of a constituent)
absorbed in a consolidation or merger which, if its separate existence had
continued, would have had power and authority to indemnify its Directors,
officers and employees or agents, so that any person who is or was a
Director, officer, employee or agent of such constituent Corporation, or is or
was serving at the request of such constituent Corporation as a Director,
officer, employee or agent of another Corporation, partnership, joint
