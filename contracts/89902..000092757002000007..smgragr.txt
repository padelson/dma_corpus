limited liability company ("LS"), U.S. Restaurant Properties Operating
Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership ("USRPOLP" and with LS,
each a "Buyer" and, collectively, the "Buyers"), and LSF4 Acquisition, LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company formed solely for the purpose of effecting
the Merger (as defined herein) (the "Buyer Subsidiary").    RECITALS  
WHEREAS, the Buyers desire to acquire the Company by effecting a merger (the
"Merger") of the Buyer Subsidiary with and into the Company under the terms
hereof, whereby the shareholders of the Company will receive cash for their
shares of capital stock of the Company; and   WHEREAS, the Board of
Directors or other governing body of each of the Company, the Buyers and the
Buyer Subsidiary deem the Merger desirable and in the best interests of their
respective shareholders, partners and members of each of the Company, the
Buyers and the Buyer Subsidiary.   AGREEMENT   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants, representations,
warranties, and agreements herein contained, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:   ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   SECTION 1.01 THE MERGER. At the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.02), and in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement, the Tennessee Business Corporation Act (the "Tennessee
Act") and the Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the
"Delaware Act"), the Buyer Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the
Company, the separate corporate existence of the Buyer Subsidiary shall
thereupon cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the
Merger (sometimes referred to as the "Surviving Corporation"). At the
Effective Time, the Merger shall have the other effects provided in the
applicable provisions of the Tennessee Act and the Delaware Act.   SECTION
1.02 EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER. Subject to, and promptly following (but
not more than one (1) Business Day (as defined herein) (unless the Company
and the Buyers shall otherwise mutually agree)), the receipt of the vote of
the shareholders of the Company approving this Agreement and the satisfaction
or waiver of all other conditions to the consummation of the Merger set forth
in Article V of this Agreement, the Company and the Buyer Subsidiary shall
(a) execute in the manner required by the Tennessee Act and deliver for
filing to the Secretary of State of the State of Tennessee, articles of
merger with respect to the   Merger (the "Articles of Merger") and (b)
execute in the manner required by the Delaware Act and deliver for filing to
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger with
respect to the Merger (the "Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become
effective upon the filing of the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of
State of the State of Tennessee in accordance with Section 48-21-107 of the
Tennessee Act and the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware in accordance with Section 204 of the
Delaware Act. The date and time of the filing of the Articles of Merger and
Certificate of Merger, or such later date and time as may be specified in the
Articles of Merger and the Certificate of Merger by mutual agreement of the
Buyers, the Buyer Subsidiary and the Company, is hereinafter referred to as
the "Effective Time."   SECTION 1.03 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION AND BY-LAWS
OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION. The Charter (as defined herein) of the Company
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Charter of the
Surviving Corporation, until amended in accordance with the laws of the State
of Tennessee and such Charter. The By-Laws of the Company in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation, until further amended in accordance with the laws of
the State of Tennessee, the Charter of the Surviving Corporation and such By-
Laws.   SECTION 1.04 BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS OF THE
SURVIVING CORPORATION. The directors of the Buyer Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each of such directors to hold office, subject to the applicable
provisions of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation, until the expiration of the term for which such director was
elected and until such director\'s successor is elected and has qualified or
as otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws of the
Surviving Corporation. The officers of the Buyer Subsidiary immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are chosen and have qualified or as
otherwise provided in the By- Laws of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION
1.05 CONVERSION OF SHARES. The manner and basis of converting the shares of
stock of each of the Company and the Buyer Subsidiary shall be as
follows:   (a) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock of the
Company, par value $1.00 per share (the "Company Common Stock"), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Merger
Shares") (other than (i) Dissenting Shares (as defined herein) and (ii)
shares of Company Common Stock held of record by the Buyers or the Buyer
Subsidiary or any other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a Buyer
or by the Company immediately before the Effective Time), shall, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be
converted into, and represent the right to receive, $.36 in cash (the
"Merger Consideration"), without interest. Unless the context otherwise
requires, each reference in this Agreement to shares of Company Common Stock
or Merger Shares shall include the associated Company Rights (as defined
herein) issued pursuant to the Company Rights Agreement (as defined herein).
Without limiting any other provision of this Agreement, the Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any stock
split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution
of securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. No  
2  share of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding or to
have any rights other than payment therefor pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement after the Effective Time.   (b) At the Effective Time, all
of the membership interests of the Buyer Subsidiary, issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and
exchanged for 100 fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately subsequent
to the Effective Time.   (c) At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Common Stock held of record by the Buyers or the Buyer Subsidiary or any
other direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of a Buyer or by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be canceled and cease
to exist, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.   SECTION 1.06
DISSENTERS\' RIGHTS.   (a) Notwithstanding Section 1.05 hereof, shares of
Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, if any, that are held of record or beneficially owned by a
Person (as defined herein) who has properly exercised and preserved and
perfected dissenters\' rights with respect to such shares under Sections
48-23-202 and 48-23-204 of the Tennessee Act and has not withdrawn or lost
such rights (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration for such shares, but
instead shall be treated in accordance with Sections 48-23-206 and 48-23-208
of the Tennessee Act, unless and until such Person effectively withdraws or
loses such Person\'s right to payment under Section 48-23-206 of the
Tennessee Act (through failure to preserve or protect such right or
otherwise). If, subsequent to the Effective Time, any such Person shall
effectively withdraw or lose such right, then each such Dissenting Share held
of record or beneficially owned by such Person will thereupon be treated as
if it had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, without interest, except as may be required by
law.   (b) Each Person holding of record or beneficially owning
Dissenting Shares who becomes entitled, under the provisions of Sections
48-23-102 and 48-23-202 of the Tennessee Act, to payment of the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares shall receive payment therefor (plus interest
determined in accordance with Section 48-23-206 of the Tennessee Act) from
the Surviving Corporation.   (c) The Company shall give the Buyers prompt
written notice upon receipt by the Company at any time prior to the Effective
Time of any notice of intent to demand the fair value of any shares of
Company Common Stock under Section 48-23-206 of the Tennessee Act and any
withdrawal of any such notice. The Company will not, except with the prior
written consent of the Buyers, negotiate, voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demand at any time prior
to the Effective Time.   SECTION 1.07 STOCK PLANS OF THE COMPANY.   (a)
Pursuant to the Merger, at the Effective Time, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law and the applicable agreements and plans, each
outstanding option or right to   3  purchase or receive shares of Company
Common Stock (the "Options") under any of the Company\'s stock option plans,
stock purchase plans, deferred compensation plans or other arrangements
(collectively, the "Stock Plans") will, with respect to each share of Company
Common Stock subject thereto, become an option to receive the Merger
Consideration on payment of the exercise price of such Option, and will
otherwise remain outstanding in accordance with its terms; provided, to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law and the applicable Options and
Stock Plans, if the exercise price per share under any Option exceeds the
Merger Consideration, then that Option will be terminated automatically and
will cease to exist as of the Effective Time.   (b) Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts, to the
extent permitted by law and the applicable Options and Stock Plans: (i) to
obtain any consents from holders of the Options and (ii) to make any
amendments to the terms of Stock Plans and Options that, in case of either
(i) or (ii), are necessary or appropriate to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 1.07.   (c) The Company shall take no action to
accelerate the vesting of any outstanding Option or any other warrant or
right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock, other than as is required by
the terms of such Options, warrants or rights, as a result of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   SECTION 1.08 PAYMENT FOR
MERGER SHARES.   (a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Buyers or
the Buyer Subsidiary shall deposit or cause to be deposited in immediately
available funds with Registrar and Transfer Company or any other disbursing
agent having capital, surplus and undivided profits in excess of $500 million
that is selected by the Buyers and reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(the "Disbursing Agent"), cash in an amount equal to the product (rounded up
or down to the nearest $.01) of (i) the number of Merger Shares times (ii)
the Merger Consideration (such amount being referred to as the "Fund").   
(b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyers shall deliver irrevocable
written instructions to the Disbursing Agent, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, to make, out of the Fund, the
payments referred to in Section 1.05(a) in accordance with Section 1.08(c).
The Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as provided in this
Agreement. Any amounts remaining in the Fund including, without limitation,
all interest and other income received by the Disbursing Agent in respect of
amounts in the Fund six (6) months after the Closing Date (as defined herein)
may be refunded to the Surviving Corporation, at its option; provided,
however, that the Surviving Corporation shall continue to be liable for any
payments required to be made thereafter under Section 1.05(a) hereof. If any
Merger Consideration shall not have been disbursed prior to two (2) years
after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which
any Merger Consideration payable to the former holders of Company Common
Stock would otherwise escheat to, or become the property of, any Governmental
Authority (as defined herein)), any such Merger Consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (c) As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Disbursing Agent shall mail to each record holder of
certificate(s) representing Merger Shares a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
any certificate   4  representing Merger Shares shall pass, only upon
actual delivery of such certificate to the Disbursing Agent) for return to
the Disbursing Agent, and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such certificate or certificates and the receipt of the Merger Consideration
for each of such holder\'s Merger Shares under Section 1.05(a). For purposes
of the immediately preceding sentence, the Buyers may rely conclusively on
the shareholder records of the Company in determining the identity of, and
the number of canceled Merger Shares held by, each holder of a certificate
or certificates representing Merger Shares at the Effective Time.
The Disbursing Agent, as soon as practicable following receipt of any
such certificate or certificates together with a duly executed letter
of transmittal and any other items specified in the letter of transmittal,
shall pay by cashier\'s check of the Disbursing Agent to the Persons
entitled thereto (subject to any required withholding of taxes by the
Surviving Corporation) the amount (rounded up or down to the nearest $.01)
determined by multiplying the number of Merger Shares represented by the
certificate or certificates so surrendered by the Merger Consideration. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender of
any such certificate or certificates. If payment is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the certificate or certificates
surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
certificate or certificates so surrendered be properly endorsed or otherwise
be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such payment
pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the certificate or certificates
surrendered, or establish to the satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.   (d) If any certificate
or certificates representing Merger Shares shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and such
indemnification against loss as the Disbursing Agent may reasonably require
by the Person claiming such certificate or certificates to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Disbursing Agent will pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed certificate or certificates to the Persons entitled
thereto (subject to any required withholding of taxes by the Surviving
Corporation) the applicable Merger Consideration in respect thereof,
calculated pursuant to Section 1.08(c), upon receipt by the Disbursing Agent
of such affidavit and indemnification against loss.   (e) None of the
Buyers, the Buyer Subsidiary, the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock for any
consideration from the Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.   (f) The Buyers or
the Disbursing Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of Company Common Stock such
amounts as the Buyers (or any Affiliate (as defined herein) thereof) or the
Disbursing Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), or any applicable provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax Law (as defined herein). To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld by the Buyers (or any Affiliate thereof) or the Disbursing
Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Common Stock in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by the Buyers (or
any Affiliate thereof) or the Disbursing Agent.   5    SECTION 1.09 NO
FURTHER RIGHTS OR TRANSFERS. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be canceled and cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or
certificates that represented shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any
rights as a shareholder of the Company with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such certificate or certificates, except for the
right to surrender such certificate or certificates in exchange for the
payment provided under Section 1.05(a) or to preserve and perfect such
holder\'s right to receive payment for such holder\'s shares under Section
48-23-202 of the Tennessee Act and Section 1.06 hereof if such holder has
validly exercised and not withdrawn or lost such right, and no transfer of
shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be made on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation.   SECTION 1.10 FURTHER ASSURANCES. At and after the Effective
Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be
authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company,
the Buyers or the Buyer Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, the
Buyers or the Buyer Subsidiary, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.   ARTICLE II   CLOSING   SECTION
2.01 GENERALLY. Subject to Articles V and VII, the closing (the "Closing") of
the Merger shall occur not later than the Business Day next following the
special meeting of the shareholders of the Company to be called pursuant to
Section 4.02, or at such other time as the Company and the Buyers may
mutually agree (the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at 10:00 a.m.,
local time, at the offices of Jenkens and Gilchrist, a
Professional Corporation, 1445 Ross Avenue, Suite 3200, Dallas, Texas 75202,
or at such other time and place as the Company and the Buyers may mutually
agree.   SECTION 2.02 DELIVERIES AT THE CLOSING. Subject to Articles V and
VII, at the Closing:   (a) there shall be delivered to the Buyers, the
Buyer Subsidiary and the Company the certificates and other documents and
instruments, the delivery of which is contemplated under Article V;   (b)
the Company and the Buyer Subsidiary shall cause the Articles of Merger and
the Certificate of Merger to be filed as provided in Section 1.02 and shall
take all other lawful actions and do all other lawful things necessary to
cause the Merger to become effective; and   (c) subject to the right of the
Surviving Corporation to receive a refund of amounts remaining in the Fund
six (6) months after the Closing Date pursuant to Section 1.08(b), the Buyers
and/or the Buyer Subsidiary shall irrevocably deposit with the Disbursing
Agent the amount designated as the Fund in Section 1.08(a).   6   ARTICLE
III   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES   SECTION 3.01 REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY. The Company represents and warrants to the Buyers
and the Buyer Subsidiary, subject to such exceptions as are disclosed in
writing in the disclosure letter supplied by the Company to the Buyers and
the Buyer Subsidiary, dated as of the date hereof (the "Disclosure Letter"),
as follows:   (a) Organization.   (i) The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly organized,  validly existing and in good standing under
the laws of the  jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has
all the  requisite corporate power and authority, and is in possession of
all  franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, 
consents, waivers, qualifications, certificates, Orders (as defined  herein)
and approvals (collectively, "Approvals") necessary to own,  lease and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as it  is now being
conducted, except for such Approvals, the failure of  which to possess,
individually or in the aggregate, could not  reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect (as defined  herein). The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries is duly qualified  or licensed to do business, and is in good
standing, in each  jurisdiction in which the character of the properties
owned, leased  or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such 
qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be  so duly
qualified or licensed or in good standing that, individually  or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a  Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has heretofore furnished  or made available to the Buyers
true and complete copies, including  all amendments, of each of the Charter
(as defined herein) and  By-Laws (or other equivalent governing documents),
as currently in  effect for the Company and each Subsidiary.   (ii) Section
3.01(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter sets forth a  true and complete list of
all of the Company\'s directly and  indirectly owned Subsidiaries, together
with the jurisdiction of  incorporation or organization of each Subsidiary
and the percentage  of each Subsidiary\'s outstanding capital stock or other
equity or  other interest owned by the Company or another Subsidiary of the 
Company. Except as set forth in the SEC Reports (as defined herein)  and in
Section 3.01(a)(ii) of the Disclosure Letter, neither the  Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries owns any equity or similar  interest in, or any interest
convertible into or exchangeable or  exercisable for, directly or indirectly,
any equity or similar  interest in, any Person.   (iii) Except as set forth
in Section 3.01(a)(iii) of the  Disclosure Letter, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary is the  general partner of a partnership or holds an ownership
interest in  any other entity that could result in the holder of that
ownership  interest being liable for the debts or obligations of that
entity.   (b) Capitalization.   (i) The authorized capital of the Company
consists of 200,000,000  shares of Company Common Stock. As of January 22,
2002, there are,  (A) 51,709,122 shares of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding,  including the associated Rights; (B) no   7   shares of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company;  (C) no shares of
Company Common Stock held by the Subsidiaries of the  Company; (D) 3,534,652
shares of Company Common Stock duly reserved  for future issuance pursuant to
Options granted pursuant to the Stock  Plans; (E) 5,884,695 shares of Company
Common Stock duly reserved for  future issuance pursuant to the Company\'s
Stock Plans (including  322,126 shares that will be issued in January 2002
for withholdings  during 2001 under the Company\'s stock purchase plan); (F)
804,489  shares of Company Common Stock duly reserved for issuance upon 
conversion of certain Liquid Yield Option Notes due 2004 and certain  8.25%
convertible subordinated debentures due 2002 (collectively, the  "Convertible
Debt"); and (G) 12,927,281 shares of Company Common  Stock duly reserved for
issuance pursuant to the exercise of Rights.  None of the outstanding shares
of Company Common Stock were issued  by the Company in violation of any
purchase option, call option,  right of first refusal, preemptive right,
subscription right or any  similar right. Except as set forth above, as of
the date hereof, no  shares of voting or non-voting capital stock, other
equity interests,  or other voting securities of the Company are issued,
reserved for  issuance or outstanding. All outstanding Options to purchase
Company  Common Stock were granted under the Stock Plans. No outstanding 
Options or other outstanding securities convertible, exercisable or 
exchangeable for Company Common Stock, have exercise prices of less  than
$0.36 per share of Company Common Stock. Except as set forth  above, there
are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness  of the Company with
voting rights (or convertible into, or  exchangeable for, securities with
voting rights) on any matters on  which shareholders of the Company may
vote.   (ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(a)(ii) of the Disclosure 
Letter, the Company is the direct or indirect owner of all of the  authorized
and outstanding shares of capital stock, other equity  securities or
securities convertible, exercisable or exchangeable for  equity securities,
of each of the Company\'s Subsidiaries. All of the  outstanding shares of
capital stock or other equity securities of  each of the Subsidiaries have
been duly authorized and validly  issued, and are fully paid and
nonassessable, and not subject to, and  were not issued in violation of, any
preemptive (or similar) rights,  and are owned, of record and beneficially,
by the Company or one of  its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, free and clear
of all Liens (as  defined herein). Except as set forth in the Captain D\'s
Documents  (as defined herein) and the FFCA Documents (as defined herein),
there  are no restrictions of any kind that prevent the payment of
dividends  by any of the Company\'s Subsidiaries, and neither the Company nor
any  of its Subsidiaries is subject to any obligation or requirement to 
provide funds for or to make any investment (in the form of a loan  or
capital contribution or otherwise) to or in any Person.   (iii) Except for
this Agreement, the Rights, the Options, the  Convertible Debt and as
described in the SEC Reports, as of the date  hereof, there are no
outstanding securities, options, warrants,  calls, rights, convertible or
exchangeable securities, commitments,  agreements, arrangements or
undertakings of any kind (contingent or  otherwise) to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party  or by which any of them is bound
obligating the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued,  delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock
or other equity  securities of the Company or of any of its Subsidiaries or
obligating  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend
or  enter into any such security, option, warrant,   8   call, right,
commitment, agreement, arrangement or undertaking.  There are no outstanding
contractual obligations of the Company or  any of its Subsidiaries to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire  any shares of capital stock or other
equity securities (or Options  or warrants to acquire any such shares or
other equity securities)  of the Company or its Subsidiaries. Except as set
forth in Section  3.01(b)(iii) of the Disclosure Letter, as of the date
hereof, there  are no stock-appreciation rights, stock-based performance
units,  "phantom" stock rights or other agreements, arrangements or 
commitments of any character (contingent or otherwise), pursuant to  which

the creation of any Lien on the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Material Contract (as defined herein).   (e) SEC

payable or for Taxes contested in good faith and for which adequate  reserves

Intellectual Property. The Company believes that all registered trademarks,

the business of the Company or its Subsidiaries as currently conducted. All
Marks (and all applications therefor) are currently in compliance in all
material respects with all legal requirements (including, without limitation,
timely filings, proofs and payments of all fees), and are valid and
enforceable, and are not subject to any filings, fees or other actions
falling due within ninety (90) days after the date hereof. Except as could
not be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect,
the Company and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise possess adequate licenses
or other valid rights to use, sell and license, free and clear of any and
all adverse claims (including by current and former employees and
contractors), Liens, restrictions or other obligation to pay royalties,
honoraria or other fees, any and all   19  Intellectual Property (as

proposed to be conducted. No Marks have been within the preceding three (3)
years or are now the subject of any Litigation (as defined herein) and, to
the knowledge of Company and its Subsidiaries, no Litigation related thereto
is threatened. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have taken all
reasonable steps to maintain, police and protect the Marks that they own or
use. The conduct of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses as
currently conducted or planned to be conducted does not infringe or otherwise
impair or conflict with ("Infringe") any third party proprietary rights of
any third party, and the Intellectual Property is not being Infringed by any
third party, except for such Infringements, the occurrence of which,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. There is no Litigation or Order pending or
outstanding, or to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, that seeks to
limit or challenge or that concerns the ownership, use, validity or
enforceability of any Marks. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the alteration, loss or
impairment of the validity, enforceability or the Company\'s or any of its
Subsidiaries\' right to own or use any Intellectual Property. The Company has
made available to the Buyers a list of all software (other than generally
commercially available, non-custom, off-the-shelf software application
programs having a retail acquisition price of less than $25,000) that is

software is owned, otherwise used and/or licensed or otherwise distributed by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to any third party, as the case may
be.   (k) Litigation. Except as described in the SEC Reports filed prior

adequate reserves have been established in the Draft Financials; or (iii) for
which all material costs and liabilities arising therefrom are reimbursable
pursuant to common area maintenance or similar agreements; no Litigation is
pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company
or any Subsidiary that, in the event of a final adverse determination
thereof, could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to
have a Material Adverse Effect or that seeks to enjoin or otherwise challenge
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is specifically identified as a party
subject to any restrictions or limitations under any injunction, writ,

given written notice  of any violation of, any statute, Law, rule,

authorization  or Approval applicable to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or  by which any property, asset or operation of the Company or
any of  its Subsidiaries is bound or effected, except for failures to
comply  or violations that have not resulted in, or could not reasonably be 
expected to result in, the imposition of a criminal fine, penalty or 
sanction against the Company, any of its   20   Subsidiaries or any of
their respective officers or directors, or  that, individually or in the
aggregate, could not reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company and its  Subsidiaries are in compliance with the material
terms of all  Approvals.   (ii) To the knowledge of the Company, as of the
date hereof,  neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any

Authorities and all Courts and other tribunals for the conduct of the 
businesses and operations of the Company and such Subsidiary as now 
conducted (collectively, the "Required Licenses"), except where the  failure
to have a Required License could not reasonably be expected  to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. There are no proceedings  pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened which may  result in the revocation,
cancellation or suspension, or any adverse  modification, of any such
Required License, except for such  revocations, cancellations, suspensions or
adverse modifications  that, individually or in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.   (m) No Brokers

contemplated by this Agreement based upon arrangements made by or on behalf
of the Company. The Company has heretofore furnished to the Buyers a true and

(individually, an "Employee  Plan" and collectively, the "Employee Plans"),
have been delivered  or made available to the Buyers. In addition, summaries

in amount and the failure to make such payments or  contributions will not
materially and adversely affect the Employee  Plans.   (iii) Except as set
forth in Section 3.01(n)(iii) of the  Disclosure Letter, each Employee Plan
(and any related trust or other  funding instrument) has been administered in
all material respects  in compliance with its terms and in both form and

meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has  received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue  Service as to its
qualification, and nothing has occurred, whether  by action or failure to
act, that could reasonably be expected to  cause the loss of such
qualification.   (v) Except as set forth in Section 3.01(n)(v) of the
Disclosure  Letter, no Employee Plan exists that could result in the payment
to  any present or former employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of  any
money or other property or accelerate or provide any other rights  or

interested shareholder of the Company during the five-year period preceding
the Merger, Section 48-103-205 of the Tennessee Act applicable to a
"business combination" does not, and will not, prohibit the transactions
contemplated hereunder, and the restrictions contained in the Tennessee
Control Share Acquisition Act applicable to "control share acquisitions" will
not prohibit the authorization, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger by the Company. The Company has
taken all necessary action to exempt the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement from any applicable "moratorium," "control share," "fair price,"
"business combination," or other anti-takeover laws and regulations of the
State of Tennessee, including, without limitation, the relevant provisions of
Chapter 48 of the Tennessee Act.   (u) Affiliate Transactions. Except to
the extent disclosed in any SEC Report filed prior to the date of this
Agreement, there are no other transactions, agreements, arrangements or
understandings between the Company or any Subsidiary, on the one hand, and
the Company\'s directors and executive employees or other Persons, on the
other hand, that would be required to be filed or described pursuant to Items
402 or 404 of Regulation S-K.   (v) Change of Control Agreements. Except as
set forth in the SEC Reports or as set forth in Section 3.01(v) of the

make, result in, cause the accelerated vesting or delivery of (except as
contemplated by Section 1.07), or increase the amount or value of, any
payment or benefit to any director, officer or employee of the Company.

expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or give rise  to a right on the
part of any Franchisee to terminate any such  agreement, where the
termination of such agreement could reasonably  be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company  nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any fees pursuant to any  Franchise Agreement that is currently, or

register or obtain an exemption could not reasonably be  expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and the Company, its  Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of the Company, all Franchisees  have otherwise complied with all
applicable franchise offering  circular and Franchise Agreement delivery
requirements under  applicable state, federal and foreign Laws, obtained all
