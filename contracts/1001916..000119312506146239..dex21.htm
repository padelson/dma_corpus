-11- (b) _Earnout Amount_. As part of the Merger Consideration, Parent will pay the
Earnout Amount in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.7(b).

(i) The Earnout Amount will be determined as follows:

a) if the Company Revenues for the Measurement Period are greater than or
equal to $87,800,000, then the Earnout Amount will be $10,000,000.

 

b) if the Company Revenues for the Measurement Period are greater than or
equal to $70,240,000, but less than $87,800,000, then the Earnout Amount will
be equal to (1) a fraction, the numerator of which is the excess of the
Company Revenues over $70,240,000, and the denominator of which is
$17,560,000, multiplied by (2) $10,000,000.

c) if the Company Revenues for the Measurement Period are less than
$70,240,000, then the Earnout Amount will be $0.

(ii) Within fifteen (15) business days following the completion of the
Measurement Period (i.e., on or before October 19, 2007), Parent will provide
the Shareholder Representative with a certificate setting forth the Company
Revenues for the Measurement Period and the calculation of the Earnout Amount
(the "Certificate").

(iii) Parent will provide the Shareholder Representative and its agents and
representatives with reasonable access (with at least 48 hours prior
notice) to the personnel, books and records of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation to assist the Shareholder Representative in its review of Parents
calculation of the Company Revenues.

(iv) The Shareholder Representative shall notify Parent in writing (the "
_Dispute Notice_ ") within thirty (30) days after receiving Parents
calculation of the Company Revenues or the Earnout Amount if the Shareholder
Representative disagrees with Parents calculation of the Company Revenues or
the Earnout Amount, and such notice (if given) shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such dispute and the dollar amounts involved and the
Shareholder Representatives calculation of the Company Revenues and Earnout
Amount.

(v) If no Dispute Notice is given within such thirty (30) day period, then
Parents calculation of the Earnout Amount shall be final and binding upon
the Parties and the Company Shareholders.

(vi) Upon receipt of a Dispute Notice, Parent and the Shareholder
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with
respect to the calculation of the Company Revenues. If Parent and the
Shareholder Representative are unable to agree with respect to the calculation
of the Company Revenues within thirty (30) days after the date of the Dispute
Notice, Parent and the Shareholder Representative shall submit their disputes
to an accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Shareholder
Representative for a binding resolution within thirty (30) days thereafter.
The cost of such accounting firm shall be paid one-half by Parent and one-half
by the Company Shareholders.

(vii) Upon final determination of the Earnout Amount,



 

-12- a) Parent will pay to each of the Cash Shareholders an amount in cash equal to
the Cash Shareholders Proportionate Interest in the Earnout Amount; and

b) Parent will issue the Merger Note, in the form attached as Exhibit L, to
the Shareholder Representative, as agent for the Carryover Shareholders. The
principal amount of the Merger Note will be equal to the Earnout Amount, minus
the amount of cash paid to the Cash Shareholders under (a) above. 

(viii) The interest rate under the Merger Note will be equal to the interest
rate payable by Parent under the note issued pursuant to the First Priority
Term Loan Facility (as such term is defined in the Financing Commitment
Letter) with respect to LIBOR (as such term is defined in the Financing
Commitment Letter) advances as of September 30, 2007.

(ix) The Merger Note will mature and be payable upon the earlier of (a) six
months after the original maturity date of the second priority
facility entered into in connection with the Financing Transaction, and (b)
thirty (30) days after the date on which Parents obligations under the credit
facilities issued in connection with the Financing Transaction are repaid in
full without the use of borrowed funds.

(c) _Establishment of Escrow Fund_. On the Closing Date, 10% of the Merger
Shares and Merger Cash issuable pursuant to Section 1.7(a) hereof in respect
of shares of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (calculated assuming for this purpose that there are no
Dissenting Shares) (the "Escrow Amount"), will, without any act of any
Company Shareholder, and in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow
Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B, be deposited with the Escrow Agent for
a period of 15 months by Parent on behalf of the Company Shareholders to
secure the obligations set forth in Article VII hereof and in the Escrow
Agreement. Such amount is referred to herein as the "Escrow Fund" and will be
governed by the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Notwithstanding Section
1.7(a), the amount of Merger Consideration payable to any Company Shareholder
on the Closing Date will be reduced by such Company Shareholders
Proportionate Interest in the Escrow Amount. The holders of the Company
Capital Stock, by virtue of the approval of this Agreement by the Company
Shareholders, (i) consent to the deposit of the Escrow Amount with the Escrow
Agent, and (ii) will be subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.
Any payments from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of valid indemnification
claims made by Parent or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to Article VII, as
determined pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, shall be comprised of shares of
Parent Common Stock and Merger Cash in the same proportion as such forms of
consideration constitute the initial Escrow Amount.

(d) _Cancellation of Company or Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of Company
Common Stock held by the Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct
or indirect wholly-owned Company Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof.

(e) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, all outstanding Company Stock
Options shall be treated in accordance with Section 5.1.



 

-13- (f) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of Common Stock, $0.01 par value

outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.001
par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate
evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence
ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(g) _Adjustments to Common Exchange Ratio_. The Common Exchange Ratio shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Parent Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

(h) _Appointment of Representative for Merger Note_. By voting to adopt the
Agreement and approve the Merger, or participating in the Merger and accepting
the benefits thereof, each Company Shareholder shall be deemed to have
approved the designation of and designates the Shareholder Representative as
the representative of the Company Shareholders and as the attorney-in-fact and
agent for and on behalf of each Company Shareholder with respect to the Merger
Notes and the Merger Note Consideration payable thereunder and the taking by
the Shareholder Representative of any and all actions and the making of any

Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.

(i) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock,
fraction of a cent of Merger Cash or fraction of a cent of the Earnout Amount
will be issued or paid by virtue of the Merger. Instead, (i) any fraction of a
share of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be received by a holder of
Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.7(a) shall be aggregated and any
remaining fraction of a share will be rounded down to the nearest whole share,
(ii) any fraction of a cent of Merger Cash or Earnout Amount that would
otherwise be received by a holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section
1.7(a) shall be aggregated and any remaining fraction of a cent will be
rounded down to the nearest whole cent.

1.8 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Capital Stock that have not been voted for approval of the
Merger and with respect to which such shareholders become entitled to exercise
dissenters rights in accordance with O.C.G.A. §§ 14-2-1301 et seq.
("Dissenting Shares"), will not be converted into or represent a right to
receive consideration in connection with the Merger pursuant to Section 1.7,
but will instead be converted into the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to Georgia Law.



 

-14- (b) If a holder of Dissenting Shares (a "Dissenting Shareholder") withdraws
such holders demand for such payment and appraisal or becomes ineligible for
such payment and appraisal, then, as of the Effective Time or the occurrence
of such event of withdrawal or ineligibility, whichever last occurs, such
holders Dissenting Shares will cease to be Dissenting Shares and will be
converted into the right to receive, and will be exchangeable for, that
portion of the Merger Consideration, without interest thereon, into which such
Dissenting Shares would have been converted pursuant to Section 1.7(a).

(c) The Company will give Parent and Merger Sub prompt notice of any written
demands or withdrawals of dissenters rights with regard to Company Common
Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to any demands for dissenters rights. The Company
agrees that, except with the prior written consent of Parent and Merger Sub,
or as required under Georgia Law, it will not voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, or settle or offer or agree to settle, any such demand for
appraisal. Each Dissenting Shareholder who, pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 14-2-1301
et seq., becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares will receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor has
been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions).

Shareholder(s) for Dissenting Shares pursuant to O.C.G.A. §§ 14-2-1301 et
seq. in excess of the value such Dissenting Shareholder(s) would have received
in the Merger for such Dissenting Shares shall constitute "Excess Payments."

the amount of the Excess Payments from the Escrow Fund.

1.9 _Surrender of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Wells Fargo Shareholder Services shall act as the
exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger. The Parties agree that

outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock and any dividends or distributions
to which holders of shares of Company Capital Stock may be entitled pursuant
to Section 1.9(d).

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. At Closing, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent
to deliver to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a
Certificate or Certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section
1.7, (together with any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
1.9(d)): (i) a letter of transmittal in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates



 

-15- to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other customary provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Merger
Shares, Merger Cash and Merger Note Consideration and any dividends or other
distributions pursuant to Section 1.9(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be
appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders
of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
(subject in each case to the escrow provisions of Section 1.7(c)) (i)
certificates representing the number of whole Merger Shares into which their
shares of Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, (ii) an
amount of cash equal to the fraction of the Merger Cash or Merger Note
Consideration into which their shares of Company Common Stock were converted
at the Effective Time and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.9(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section
1.9(d) as to the payment of dividends, to evidence only the ownership of the
number of Merger Shares and the amount of Merger Cash and Merger
Note Consideration into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have
been so converted and the right to receive any dividends or distributions
payable pursuant to Section 1.9(d).

(d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect
to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be
paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record
of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable
law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to the record holders thereof, in exchange therefor, without interest,
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued, and
Merger Cash and Merger Note Consideration paid and the amount of any such
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

(e) _Transfers of Ownership_. If certificates representing Merger Shares are
to be issued, or Merger Cash or Merger Note Consideration is to be paid, in a
name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange
therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance and payment
thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons requesting such
exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent designated by it any transfer
or other Taxes required by reason of the issuance of
certificates representing Merger Shares and payment of Merger Cash and Merger
Note Consideration in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(f) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to
any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable
Legal Requirement. To the



 

-16- extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated
for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to
whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

(g) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
1.9, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any
Party shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Capital Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

1.10 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. All Merger
Shares issued and Merger Cash and Merger Note Consideration paid in accordance
with the terms hereof (together with any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 1.9(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Capital Stock, and there
shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Capital Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I.

1.11 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificates shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange
for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the
Merger Shares, Merger Cash and Merger Note Consideration into which the shares
of Company Capital Stock represented by such Certificates were converted
pursuant to Section 1.7 and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to
Section 1.9(d); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing Merger
Shares, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond or other form of security in such
sum as Parent may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with
respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed, if
such requirement is reasonable in light of suspicious or unusual
circumstances surrounding the loss, theft or destruction of the Certificate.

1.12 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full

powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the current officers and
directors of the Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and
necessary action.

transactions and agreements contemplated hereby will be considered a taxable
transaction for federal income tax purposes.

Consideration delivered and made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
this Article I and not exchanged for Company Common Stock within six (6)
months after the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.9 above shall be
returned by the Exchange Agent to Parent, which thereafter shall act as
Exchange Agent subject to the rights of holders of unsurrendered Certificates
under this Article I. Thereafter

(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) only as
general creditors thereof with respect to any Merger Consideration that may be
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.

may have any liability (collectively, the "Company Employee Benefit Plans")
with respect to employees or other service-providers or former employees or
other service-providers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries. The
Company does not have any ERISA Affiliates (as defined below) other than a
Company Subsidiary, and no Company Subsidiaries have any ERISA Affiliates. For

required under, and is not subject to liability under, the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws, and with the terms of

Company. Each Company Employee Benefit Plan can be amended, terminated or
otherwise discontinued at or after the Effective Time in accordance with its

administrative fees associated with the termination of benefit plans.

(c) All contributions to, and payments from, the Pension Plans which are
required to have been made in accordance with the Pension Plans have been

Knowledge of the Company, all of the Companys Pension Plans and the Company
Subsidiaries Pension Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code
so qualify, and no event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to
the form or operation of such Pension Plans which would cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax
under ERISA or the Code, except for such operational failures as have not had,
or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(e) To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no (i) investigations pending
by any governmental entity involving the Company Employee Benefit Plans, nor
(ii) pending or threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits),
suits or proceedings against any Company Employee Benefit Plans, against the
assets of any of the trusts under any Company Employee Benefit Plans or 



 

-32- against any fiduciary of any Company Employee Benefit Plans or against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to the operation of such plan
or asserting any rights or claims to benefits under any Company Employee
Benefit Plans or against the assets of any trust under such plan, except for
those which would not, individually or in the aggregate, give rise to any
liability which has had, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company. To the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts which would give rise to any liability under this Section 2.17(e)
except for those which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company in the
event of any such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.

(f) None of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge
of the Company, any employee of the foregoing, nor any
trustee, administrator, other fiduciary or any other "party in interest" or
"disqualified person" with respect to the Pension Plans or Welfare Plans, has
engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section
4975 of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA) other than such transactions that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on the Company.

(g) None of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries maintains or
contributes to, nor have they ever maintained or contributed to, any pension
plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or Section 302
of ERISA.

(h) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has incurred any material
liability under Title IV of ERISA or under Code Section 4.13 that has not been

413(c).

material communications with participants, the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor, or any other governmental authority, administrators,
trustees, beneficiaries and alternate payees relating to any Company Employee
Benefit Plan.

(k) None of the Welfare Plans maintained by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any participant

Company Subsidiaries which maintain a "group health plan" within the meaning
of



 

-33- Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied with the notice and continuation
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder except where the failure to
comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. 

(l) No liability under any Pension Plan or Welfare Plan has been funded or
self-insured nor has any such obligation been satisfied with the purchase of
a contract from an insurance company as to which the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries has received notice that such insurance company is in
rehabilitation or a comparable proceeding.

(m) Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.17(m)_ of the Company Schedules,
neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor any termination of employment or any other service
relationship, will result in an increase in the amount of compensation or
benefits or accelerate the vesting or timing of payment of any benefits or
compensation payable to or in respect of any employee, director or consultant
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. There has been no amendment
to, written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or change in participation or
coverage under, any Company Employee Benefit Plan which would materially
increase the expense of maintaining such Company Employee Benefit Plan above
the level of expense incurred with respect to such Company Employee Benefit
Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Company Financial
Statements.

(n) _Schedule 2.17(n)_ of the Company Schedules lists each Company Foreign
Plan (other than a Company Employee Benefit Plan) (as hereinafter defined).
For purposes hereof, the term "Company Foreign Plan" means any material plan,
program, policy, arrangement or agreement maintained or contributed to by, or
entered into with, the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
employees (or former employees) employed outside the United States to the
extent the benefits provided thereunder are not mandated by the laws of
the applicable foreign jurisdiction and with respect to which the Company has
any material liability. As regards each Company Foreign Plan, (i) such Company
Foreign Plan is in material compliance with the provisions of the legal
requirements of each jurisdiction in which such Company Foreign Plan is being
maintained; (ii) all contributions to, and material payments from, a Company
Foreign Plan which have been required under applicable law or the terms of
such plan to be made have been timely made or shall be timely made by the
Closing Date (and are reflected as an accrued liability on the Current Balance
Sheet); (iii) the Company and each Company Subsidiary have materially complied
with all applicable reporting and notice requirements applicable to such
Company Foreign Plan; (iv) there are no pending investigations by any
governmental body involving the Company Foreign Plans, and no pending claims,
suits or proceedings against such Company Foreign Plan (other than claims for
benefits payable in the normal operation of such plan); (v) the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not itself create or
otherwise result in any liability with respect to such Company Foreign Plan;
and (vi) no condition exists that would prevent the Company or any Company
Subsidiary from terminating or amending any Company Foreign Plan at any time
for any reason in accordance with the terms of each such Company Foreign Plan
without the payment of fees, costs or expenses (other than payment of
benefits accrued on the Company Balance Sheet and any normal and reasonable
administrative expenses typically incurred in a termination event).



 

-34- (o) To the Knowledge of the Company and recognizing that applicable Treasury
Regulations have not been promulgated as of the date of this Agreement, (i)
no Company Employee Benefit Plan is a nonqualified deferred compensation plan
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code (each such Employee Plan,
a "Deferred Compensation Plan"); (ii) each Deferred Compensation Plan
satisfies the requirements to avoid the consequences set forth in Section
409A(a)(1) of the Code; and (iii) neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has (A) since October 4, 2004, granted to any person an interest
in any Deferred Compensation Plan which interest has been or, upon the lapse
of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such interest, will be
subject to the additional tax (including interest) imposed by Section
409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code, or (B) granted to any person an
interest in any Deferred Compensation Plan which interest has or will, because
of the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with respect to such
interest after December 31, 2004 or because such interest is earned after
December 31, 2004, be subject to the Tax imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or
(b)(4)(A) of the Code, or (C) since October 4, 2004, modified the terms of
any Deferred Compensation Plan in a manner that could cause an interest
previously granted under such plan to become subject to the additional tax
(including interest) imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4) of the Code.

(p) The Company and each Company Subsidiary is in compliance in all material
respects with the Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as
amended ("WARN Act"), or any similar state or local law. In the past two
years, (i) neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has effectuated a
"plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment
or one or more facilities or operating units within any site of employment or
facility of its business; (ii) there has not occurred a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act) affecting any site of employment or facility of the
Company and Company Subsidiaries; and (iii) neither the Company nor any

loss" (as defined in the WARN Act) during the 90 day period prior to the date
of this Agreement.

the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has all requisite power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as now being conducted, except where the failure to be so organized,
existing or in good standing or to have such power, authority or qualification
has not had, or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Parent and each Parent
Subsidiary are duly qualified as a foreign Person to do business, and are each
in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of its owned or
leased properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has
not had, or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually and in the
aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

For the purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect on Parent" means
any change, effect or circumstance that, individually or when taken together
with all other such similar or related changes, effects or circumstances that
have occurred prior to the date of determination of the occurrence of the
Material Adverse Effect on Parent (i) is materially adverse to the business,
financial condition, results of operations, or assets and liabilities, taken
as a whole, of Parent, including the Parent Subsidiaries, or (ii) would
reasonably be expected to prevent the Parent from consummating the Merger or
any of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement or to perform any of its
obligations under the Agreement before the Effective Time; provided, however,
that any change in the trading price or the trading volume of Parent Common
Stock shall not be taken into account in determining whether there has been a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(b) Neither Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries or Merger Sub is in violation of
any provision of its certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter
documents.

3.2 _Authority Relative to This Agreement_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into this Agreement, and
to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. The

Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Parent or Merger Sub, as
applicable, and assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the
other Parties, constitutes the valid and binding obligation of Parent or
Merger Sub, as applicable, enforceable against each of them in accordance with
its terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to the laws of

other equitable remedies.

authorizations, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required
under applicable federal and state securities or "blue sky" laws and state

failure to make such filing or notification or to obtain such permit,
authorization, consent or approval has not had, or could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect
on Parent. Neither the execution and delivery of the Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance by Parent and Merger Sub with all of the provisions hereof and
thereof will, subject to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as sole
shareholder of Merger Sub, which will occur immediately after the execution
and delivery hereof, (i) conflict with or result in any breach of any
provision of the certificate of incorporation, bylaws or other charter
documents of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary, (ii) violate any order, writ,
injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary, or by which any of their properties or assets may

material change in, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation,
acceleration, redemption or repurchase under, any of the terms, conditions or

3.15 _Intellectual Property Rights._

(a) The Parent owns or has the right to use all intellectual property used to
conduct its businesses (such intellectual property and the rights thereto are
collectively referred to herein as the "Parent IP Rights") except where
failure to have such right would not create a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent; provided, however, that, as to patent rights, the foregoing
representation is made solely to the Knowledge of Parent. No royalties or
other payments are payable to any Person with respect to commercialization of
any products presently sold or under development by Parent.

(b) Except as has not had, or could not reasonably be expected to have, a
Material Adverse Effect on Parent, the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not (i) constitute a breach of any instrument or agreement
governing any Parent IP Rights, (ii) cause the modification of any term of any
license or agreement relating to any Parent IP Rights including the
modification of the effective rate of any royalties or other payments provided
for in any such license or agreement, (iii) cause the forfeiture or
termination of any Parent IP Rights, or (iv) give rise to a right of

Parent and any third party, (ii) to the Knowledge of Parent, infringes in any
material respect any patent rights of any other party, or (iii) infringes in
any material respect any copyright, trade secret or trademark right of any
other party. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent,

use, sell, license or dispose of any Parent IP Rights, or asserting that any
Parent IP Rights or the proposed use, sale, license or disposition thereof, or

conflict with the rights of any other party.

(d) Parent has taken all commercially reasonably necessary steps to ensure
that Parents material source codes and material trade secrets have not been
used, distributed or otherwise commercially exploited under circumstances
which would cause the loss of copyright prior to the statutory expiration
date or the loss of trade secret status.



 

-43- (e) Except as disclosed in _Schedule 3.15(e)_ , to the Knowledge of Parent,
none of the employees or consultants of Parent is obligated under any
contract, covenant or other agreement or commitment of any nature, or subject
to any judgment, decree or order of any court or administrative agency, that
would interfere with the use of such employees or consultants best efforts
to promote the interests of Parent or that would conflict with the business of
Parent as presently conducted or proposed to be conducted. Parent has not
entered into any agreement to indemnify any other Person, including any
employee or consultant of Parent, against any charge of infringement,
misappropriation or misuse of any intellectual property, other than
indemnification provisions contained in purchase orders, customer
agreements, reseller agreements or distribution agreements, arising in the
ordinary course of business. All current and former employees and consultants
of Parent have signed valid and enforceable written assignments to Parent of
any and all rights or claims in any intellectual property that any such
employee or consultant has or may have by reason of any contribution,
participation or other role in the development, conception, creation,
reduction to practice or authorship of any invention, innovation, development
or work of authorship or any other intellectual property that is used in the
business of Parent, and Parent possesses signed copies of all such written

of the Parent Subsidiaries have paid (or Parent has paid on behalf of each of
the Parent Subsidiaries) all Taxes due and payable as shown on such Tax
Returns. The most recent financial statements contained in the Parent SEC
Reports reflect an adequate reserve (which reserves were established in
accordance with GAAP) for the payment of all Taxes of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries, accrued through the date of such financial statements. No
deficiencies for any Taxes have been proposed, asserted or assessed against

Employee Benefit Plans, are in compliance with, has performed all obligations
required under, and is not subject to liability under, the applicable
provisions of ERISA, the Code and other applicable laws, and with the terms of
each Parent Employee Benefit Plan, except where the failure to comply or the

or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(d) To the Knowledge of Parent, all of Parents Pension Plans and Parents
Subsidiaries Pension Plans intended to qualify under Section 401 of the Code
so qualify, and no event has occurred and no condition exists with respect to
the form or operation of such Pension Plans which would cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax
under ERISA or the Code, except for such operational failures as have not had,
or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(e) To the Knowledge of Parent, there are no (i) investigations pending by any
governmental entity involving the Parent Employee Benefit Plans, nor (ii)
pending or threatened claims (other than routine claims for benefits), suits
or proceedings against any Parent Employee Benefit Plans, against the assets

any fiduciary of any Parent Employee Benefit Plans or against Parent, any
Parent Subsidiary or any of its or their Parent ERISA Affiliates with respect
to the operation of such plan or asserting any rights or claims to benefits
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plans or against the assets of any trust
under such plan, except for those which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, give rise to any liability which has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To the Knowledge of
Parent, there are no facts which would give rise to any liability under this
Section 3.17(e) except for those which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent
in the event of any such investigation, claim, suit or proceeding.



 

-45- (f) None of Parent, any of the Parent Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any employee of the foregoing, nor any trustee, administrator, other
fiduciary or any other "party in interest" or "disqualified person" with
respect to the Pension Plans or Welfare Plans, has engaged in a "prohibited
transaction" (as such term is defined in Section 4975 of the Code or Section
406 of ERISA) other than such transactions that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Parent.

(g) None of Parent, any of the Parent Subsidiaries, or any of their Parent
ERISA Affiliates maintains or contributes to, nor have they ever maintained
or contributed to, any pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section
412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA.

(h) Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiaries nor any Parent ERISA Affiliate
has incurred any material liability under Title IV of ERISA or under Code
Section 4.13 that has not been satisfied in full.

multiemployer plan, within the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, or any
multiple employer plan, within the meaning of Code Section 413(c).

(j) With respect to each of the Parent Employee Benefit Plans, true, correct
and complete copies of the following documents have been made available
to Parent: (i) the plan document and any related trust agreement, including
amendments thereto, (ii) any current summary plan descriptions and other

participants, the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, or any other
governmental authority, administrators, trustees, beneficiaries and alternate

(k) None of the Welfare Plans maintained by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries provides for continuing benefits or coverage for any participant
or any beneficiary of a participant following termination of employment,
except as may be required under COBRA, or except at the expense of the
participant or the participants beneficiary. Parent and each of the Parent
Subsidiaries which maintain a "group health plan" within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code have complied with the notice and continuation
requirements of Section 4980B of the Code, COBRA, Part 6 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA and the regulations thereunder except where the failure to
comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

(l) No liability under any Pension Benefit Plan or Welfare Plan has been
funded or self-insured nor has any such obligation been satisfied with the
purchase of a contract from an insurance company as to which Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries has received notice that such insurance company is
in rehabilitation or a comparable proceeding.



 

-46- (m) Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor any termination of employment or any other service
relationship, will result in an increase in the amount of compensation or
benefits or accelerate the vesting or timing of payment of any benefits or
compensation payable to or in respect of any employee, director or consultant
of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries. There has been no amendment to,
written interpretation or announcement (whether or not written) by Parent, any
Parent Subsidiary or other Parent ERISA Affiliate relating to, or change
in participation or coverage under, any Parent Employee Benefit Plan which
would materially increase the expense of maintaining such Parent Employee
Benefit Plan above the level of expense incurred with respect to such Parent
Employee Benefit Plan for the most recent fiscal year included in the Parent
Financials.

(n) To the Knowledge of Parent and recognizing that applicable
Treasury Regulations have not been promulgated as of the date of this
Agreement, (i) no Parent Employee Benefit Plan is a Deferred Compensation
Plan; (ii) each Deferred Compensation Plan satisfies the requirements to avoid
the consequences set forth in Section 409A(a)(1) of the Code; and (iii)

interest has been or, upon the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture with
respect to such interest, will be subject to the additional tax (including
interest) imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code, or (B)
granted to any person an interest in any Deferred Compensation Plan which
interest has or will, because of the lapse of a substantial risk of forfeiture
with respect to such interest after December 31, 2004 or because such interest
is earned after December 31, 2004, be subject to the Tax imposed by Section
409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)(A) of the Code, or (C) since October 4, 2004, modified
the terms of any Deferred Compensation Plan in a manner that could cause an
interest previously granted under such plan to become subject to the
additional tax (including interest) imposed by Section 409A(a)(1)(B) or (b)(4)
of the Code.

3.18  _Environmental Matters._

(a) Except for such cases that, individually or in the aggregate, have not and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent,

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,

covenant with respect to any information relating to the Company which is

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge and agree that
immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall be permitted
to declare and pay the Permitted Dividend in accordance with Section 4.2.

4.2 _Permitted Dividend_. The Company will be permitted to make a one-time
cash dividend to the Company Shareholders in an aggregate amount equal to the
dollar amount of the cash on the Company Balance Sheet immediately prior to
the Effective Time (such distribution, the "Permitted Dividend"). The amount
of the Permitted Dividend will be subject to the following adjustments: (a)
if, as of the Closing Date, the amount of (X) the Companys accounts
receivable (net of allowance for doubtful accounts) plus cash is less than (Y)
the Companys accounts payable plus accrued expenses (excluding any expenses
that are payable or that may become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), then the amount of the Permitted
Dividend will be reduced by the amount of such difference, and (b) if, as of
the Closing Date, there is a Working Capital Shortfall (after taking into
account any cash left behind in accordance with clause (a) above), then the
amount of the Permitted Dividend will be reduced by the amount of the Working
Capital Shortfall. 



 

-51- 4.3 _No Solicitation_. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of the Effective Time or termination of this Agreement
pursuant to its terms, the Company will not, and the Company will cause its
directors, officers, employees, representatives, investment bankers, agents
and affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (a) solicit, knowingly
encourage, facilitate or knowingly induce submission of any Acquisition
Proposal by any person, entity or group (other than Parent and its affiliates,
agents, and representatives) or (b) participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or disclose any information concerning the Company to, or
afford access to the properties, books, or records of the Company, or
otherwise assist or facilitate, or enter into any agreement or understanding
with, any person, entity or group (other than Parent and its affiliates,
agents, and representatives) in connection with any Acquisition Proposal with
respect to the Company. The Company will immediately cease, and cause its
directors, officers and employees to cease any and all existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect
to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company will within one Business Day of
receipt (a) notify Parent if, on or after the date of this Agreement, it
receives any proposal or inquiry or request for information in connection with
an Acquisition Proposal or potential Acquisition Proposal and (b) notify
Parent of the significant terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal including the identity of the party making an
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, from and after the date of this Agreement,
until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time or termination of this
Agreement pursuant to its terms, the Company will not, and will cause its
directors, officers, employees, representatives, investment bankers, agents
and affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, make or authorize any public
statement, recommendation or solicitation in support of any Acquisition
Proposal made by any person, entity or group (other than Parent). The Parties
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that the provisions of
this Section 4.3 were not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the Parties that
Parent shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without
the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and
without the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent
breaches of the provisions of this Section 4.3 and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state
having jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
Parent may be entitled at law or in equity. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is understood that any violation of the restrictions set forth above by the
Company or any officer, director, agent, representative or affiliate thereof
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by the Company.

For purposes of this Agreement, an "Acquisition Proposal" means any proposal
or offer relating to (a) any merger or consolidation, or any sale or license
of substantial assets, or similar transactions involving the Company, or (b)
sale or issuance by the Company of any Company Capital Stock (including in an
equity financing or by way of a tender offer or an exchange offer), other than
the Preferred Conversion or issuances upon exercise of options and warrants
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement.



 

-52- Article V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

5.1 _Stock Options_.

(a) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the Company
Option Plan and each outstanding Company Stock Option, whether or not vested.
Each outstanding Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent will continue to
have, and be subject to, substantially equivalent terms and conditions of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any
vesting provisions or repurchase rights), except for the following:

(i) _Shares Issuable Upon Exercise_. Each outstanding Company Stock Option so
assumed will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its
terms) exclusively for (and the Company hereby covenants that each Company
Stock Option is exercisable exclusively for) (A) that number of whole shares
of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) obtained by multiplying (1) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (2) the Option Exchange Ratio.
Each outstanding Company Stock Option so assumed will not be exercisable in
whole or in part for cash.

(ii) _Option Per Share Exercise Price_. For the period beginning immediately
following the Effective Time, the per share exercise price for the shares of
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Company Stock Option will
be equal to the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) determined by
dividing (X) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which
such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective
Time by (Y) the Option Exchange Ratio.

(iii) _ISO Status_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any
Company Stock Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies ("incentive
stock options"), the option price, the number of shares purchasable pursuant
to such option and the terms and conditions of exercise of such option shall
be determined in order to comply with Section 424(a) of the Code.

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to
the participants in the Company Option Plan appropriate notice setting forth
such participants rights pursuant thereto and the grants pursuant to the
Company Option Plan shall continue in effect on the same terms and
conditions (subject to the adjustments required by this Section 5.1 after
giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall comply with the terms of the
Company Option Plan and the Parties intend that, to the extent required by,
and subject to the provisions of, such Company Option Plan and Sections 422
and 424(a) of the Code, that Company Options which qualified as incentive
stock options prior to the Effective Time continue to qualify as incentive
stock options after the Effective Time, and this provision shall be
interpreted consistent with that intent.

(c) Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of Company Options assumed in accordance with this Section 5.1. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but not later than 30 days
after the Closing Date, Parent shall file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (or any



 

-53- successor or other appropriate forms) under the Securities Act with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its
best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained
therein) for so long as such options remain outstanding. 

5.2 _Information Statement_. As soon as practicable after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall prepare, with the cooperation of Parent,
the Information Statement. The Information Statement shall also constitute a
disclosure document for the offer and issuance of the shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received by the Company Shareholders in the Merger. Parent and
the Company shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Information Statement to comply in all material respects with applicable
federal and state securities laws requirements. Each of Parent and the Company
agrees to provide promptly to the other such information concerning its
business and financial statements and affairs as, in the reasonable judgment
of the providing party or its counsel, may be required or appropriate for
inclusion in the Information Statement, or in any amendments or supplements
thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the others
counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Information Statement. The
Company will promptly advise Parent and Parent will promptly advise the
Company in writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the
Company or Parent shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it
necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Information Statement in
order to make the statements contained or incorporated by reference therein
not misleading or for compliance with applicable law. The Information
Statement shall contain a statement that the Company Board has concluded that
the terms and conditions of the Merger are fair and reasonable to the Company
Shareholders, that the Company Board has approved this Agreement and the
Merger, that the Company Board has recommended that the Company Shareholders
vote to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger, and that the holders of
a majority of the outstanding Company Capital Stock (voting on an as-converted
basis) have voted to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger. Anything to
the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the Company shall not include
in the Information Statement any information with respect to Parent or its
affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information shall not
have been approved in writing by Parent prior to such inclusion.

5.3 _Registration Statement._

(a)  _Registration_. Immediately following the Closing Date, Parent and the
Company shall mutually prepare, and Parent shall file, a registration
statement (the "Registration Statement") on Form S-3 under the Securities Act
for an offering to be made on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule
415 thereunder or any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC and
permitting sales in ordinary course brokerage or dealer transactions not
involving any underwritten public offering, covering all of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued to the Company Shareholders pursuant to Section
1.7(a) of this Agreement, and any other securities issued by Parent as a
dividend or other distribution with respect to, or in exchange for or in
replacement of, such shares (collectively, the "Registrable Shares");
_provided, however_ (i) Parent will not breach its obligation to file the
Registration Statement immediately following the Closing Date nor to seek
effectiveness of the Registration Statement to the extent that the delay in
filing is caused by (A) Ernst and Young LLPs failure to consent to the filing
of its opinion with the Registration Statement or (B) the Companys failure
to provide the information required to be provided by it and included in the



 

-54- Registration Statement, including any required historical and pro forma
financial statements, notes, managements discussion and analysis and any
other information, certificates or representations necessary to provide the
foregoing); and (ii) Parent must continue to use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause Ernst and Young LLP to provide its consent as soon as possible
(such exceptions in clauses (i) and (ii) are collectively referred to herein
as the "Registration Exceptions"). Parent shall not permit any securities
other than the Registrable Shares to be included in the Registration
Statement. Subject to the Registration Exceptions, Parent shall use its best
efforts thereafter to cause the Registration Statement to be declared
effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable. Parent may postpone
the filing or the effectiveness of the Registration Statement for a period of
up to sixty (60) days if Parent determines in good faith that the filing or
effectiveness of the Registration Statement would require the disclosure of
information that could be materially detrimental to Parent or its
stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be required to
disclose such information (or the nature thereof) to the holders of
Registrable Shares ("Holders") or the Shareholder Representative. Subject to
the Registration Exceptions and to Section 5.3(b), Parent shall use its best
efforts to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective for a period
ending on the earliest of (i) the date on which all such Registrable Shares
have been sold thereunder, (ii) such time as all Registrable Shares may be
sold within a given three-month period pursuant to Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, or (iii) the date upon which all such Registrable Shares are
freely transferable without restriction under the Securities Act.

(b) _Stop Order; Amendment of Prospectus_.

(i) Parent will notify the Holders promptly of (X) the issuance of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration Statement or (Y) the
receipt by Parent of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of the Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction.
Immediately upon receipt of any such notice, the Holders shall cease to offer
and sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement in the
jurisdiction to which such stop order or suspension relates. Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance of any such stop
order or the suspension of any such qualification and, if any such stop order
is issued or any such qualification is suspended, to obtain as soon as
possible the withdrawal or revocation thereof, and will notify the Holders at
the earliest practicable date of the date on which the Holders may offer and
sell Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement.

(ii) Parent will notify the Holders promptly if Parent is in possession of
material non-public information that an executive officer of Parent determines
in good faith should not be disclosed because it would be materially
detrimental to Parent or its stockholders but would otherwise be required to
be set forth in the prospectus used in connection with the Registration
Statement (a "Prospectus"); _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be
required to disclose such event or facts, or the nature thereof, to the
Holders or the Shareholder Representative. Immediately upon receipt of such
notice, and provided that an equivalent trading suspension has been imposed
on, and is then applicable to, all of Parents executive officers, directors
and other holders of Parent Common Stock which are registered for resale under
the Securities Act, the Holders shall cease to offer or sell any Registrable
Shares pursuant to the Prospectus, cease to deliver or use such Prospectus
and, if so requested by Parent, return to Parent, at Parents expense, all
copies (other than permanent file copies) of such Prospectus. Promptly after
Parent determines that the information may be included in an amendment
or supplement to any Prospectus, Parent will use commercially



 

-55- reasonable efforts to amend or supplement the Prospectus as promptly as
practicable in order to set forth or reflect such event or state of facts.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that an executive officer of
Parent determines in good faith that the disclosure of such information in an
amendment or supplement would be materially detrimental to Parent or
its stockholders, Parent shall be permitted to delay the filing of such an
amendment or supplement to such Prospectus for a period of time to extend no
longer than sixty (60) days. Parent will promptly furnish copies of such
amendment or supplement to such Prospectus to the Holders and notify Holders
when trading may once again commence.

(iii) Holders that are employees of Parent or any subsidiary of Parent shall
be subject to Parents Insider Trading Compliance Program and Insider Trading
Policy.

(c)  _Information Concerning the Holders_. The obligations of Parent to take
the actions contemplated by Sections 5.3(a) and 5.3(b) with respect to an
offering of Registrable Shares shall be subject to the condition that each
Holder shall (i) conform to all applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act with respect to the offering and sale of securities and
(ii) advise each underwriter, broker or dealer through which any of such
Registrable Shares are offered that such Registrable Shares are part of a
distribution that is subject to the prospectus delivery requirements of the
Securities Act. Each Holder shall furnish to Parent in writing such
information and furnish such documents as may be reasonably required by
Parent in the preparation of (A) a Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) with respect to any offering of Registrable Shares and (B) any
qualification of such Registrable Shares under state securities or "blue sky"
laws, and shall promptly notify Parent of the occurrence, from the date on
which such information or documents are furnished to the date of the closing
for the sale of such Registrable Shares, of any event relating to such Holder
that is required under the Securities Act to be set forth in such Prospectus
(or any amendment or supplement thereto).

(d)  _Expenses of Registration_. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses
incident to its performance of or compliance with this Section 5.3 and
registration of Registrable Shares in connection therewith
("Registration Expenses"); _provided_ , _however_ , the Registration Expenses
shall not include any legal fees of the Holders or any sales or underwriting
discounts, commissions or fees attributable to the sale of the Registrable
Shares, which shall be borne by the Holders.

(e) _Indemnification and Contribution_.

(i) Parent agrees to indemnify, to the extent permitted by law and subject to
the terms of this Section 5.3, each Holder and its directors, officers,
partners, members, employees and agents and each person, if any, who controls
such Holder or other person (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto) or a Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein in light of the circumstances under which they were
made not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall not be liable
to any Holder or its directors, officers, partners, members, employees or
agents or each person, if any, who controls such Holder or other person
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) (i) to the extent that any
such loss, claim, damage, liability or expense arises out of,



 

-56- or is based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement, or any omission, if
such statement or omission shall have been made in reliance upon and in
conformity with information relating to such Holder or person furnished in
writing to Parent by such Holder or person for use in the preparation of the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or such Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or (ii) if a copy of any Prospectus (or any
amendment thereto) relating to the Registration Statement was not sent or
given by or on behalf of such Holder to a purchaser of the Holders
Registrable Shares, if required by law so to have been delivered, at or prior
to the written confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Shares to such
purchaser, and if such Prospectus (as so amended or supplemented) would have
cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim, damage or liability and a
copy of such Prospectus was delivered to such Holder.

(ii) In connection with the Registration Statement, each Holder, severally
and not jointly, will indemnify, to the extent permitted by law and subject to
the terms of this Agreement, Parent, its directors, officers, employees and
agents and each person who controls Parent (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) arising out of or based upon any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto) or a Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made not misleading, to the extent that such untrue statement or omission
was made in reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished in
writing to Parent by such Holder for use in the preparation of the
Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or a Prospectus (or any
amendment or supplement thereto); _provided_ , that the liability of each
Holder hereunder shall be limited to the proportion of any such loss, claim,
damage, liability or expense which is equal to the proportion that the public
offering price of the shares by such Holder under such registration statement
bears to the total public offering price of all securities sold thereunder,
but not in any event to exceed the gross proceeds received by such Holder.

(iii) Each party entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 5.3(e)
(the "Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified
Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought,
and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such
claim or any litigation resulting therefrom; _provided_ that counsel for the
Indemnifying Party, who shall conduct the defense of such claim or
litigation, shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed); and _provided_ , _further_ , that
the delay or failure of any Indemnified Party to give notice as provided
herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this
Section 5.3(e), except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have
been materially adversely affected by such delay or failure. The Indemnified
Party may participate in such defense at the Indemnified Partys expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall pay any such
reasonable expense if the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably
concluded that there may be a conflict between the positions of the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in conducting the defense of any
such claim or litigation resulting therefrom. No Indemnified Party shall
consent to entry of any judgment or settle any claim or litigation without

-57- (iv) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 5.3(e) from the
Indemnifying Party is unavailable to a Indemnified Party hereunder in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein as
a result of a judicial determination that such indemnification may not be
enforced in such case notwithstanding this Section 5.3, the Indemnifying
Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the
amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Party as a result of such losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party
in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages,
liabilities or expense, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified
Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any
action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of
material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has
been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party
or Indemnified Party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation and no Holder will be required to contribute any amount in

(the "Section 5.15 Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification provisions
under the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect on the
date hereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Section
5.15 Indemnified Parties be indemnified by the Surviving Corporation for any
claims made by a Parent Indemnified Party pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.
The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are
at least as favorable to the Section 5.15 Indemnified Parties as those
contained in the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect
on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees
or agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by law.

of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Section 5.15 Indemnified Parties,

actions necessary to allow eligible employees of the Company that will be
employees of the Surviving Corporation ("Transitioned Employees"), to
participate on substantially similar terms in benefit programs which are
substantially comparable to those maintained for the benefit of, or offered
to, similarly situated



 

-61- employees of Parent, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, to the
extent permitted by the terms of such Parent benefit plan or any insurance
contract or agreement applicable thereto. Until such time as the Transitioned
Employees are covered by a Parent Employee Benefit Plan, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to continue to maintain the Companys comparable
benefit or insurance plan or program currently in effect. Parent shall cause
the salary of each of the Transitioned Employees at the Effective Time to be
no less than his or her salary immediately prior to the Effective Time;
provided that Parent is entitled at its sole discretion to evaluate each
Transitioned Employees performance after a standard review period and adjust
his or her salary in accordance with Parents compensation review process.
Parent will recognize employment services of each Transitioned Employee with
the Company for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual)
under any Parent Employee Benefit Plan. Each Transitioned Employees years of
service with the Company shall be otherwise recognized for all general
employment purposes, including seniority, vacation, personal time and similar
general employment purposes; provided, that any vacation time offered by
Parent in the calendar year of the Effective Time to any Transitioned
Employee shall be offset by any vacation time used by or paid to a
Transitioned Employee by the Company in the calendar year of the Effective
Time. In addition, Parent will (i) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions, waiting periods and service requirements
with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
Transitioned Employees under any group health plan sponsored by Parent, except
to the extent such preexisting conditions, exclusion, waiting period or
service requirement had not been satisfied by any such Transitioned Employee
as of the Effective Time under a group health plan sponsored by the Company;
and (ii) provide each Transitioned Employee with credit for any deductible,
co-payment and out-of-pocket limits applicable to such employees under any
such group medical plan sponsored by the Company and paid by the Transitioned
Employee prior to the Effective Time during the calendar year of
the Effective Time. At Parents request, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company Board shall adopt resolutions terminating any Company Employee Benefit
Plan intended to include an arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that if Parent
requests the Company Board to terminate any such Company Employee Benefit
Plan, Parent shall cause any Transitioned Employees covered by the terminated
Company Employee Benefit Plan to be covered by the substantially comparable
Parent Employee Benefit Plan effective immediately after the Effective Time.

5.18  _Representation on Parent Board_. Parent shall take such action as may
be necessary to appoint Jay Chaudhry to the Parents board of directors
commencing as of the Effective Time. Such appointment shall be as a Class II
director whose term expires at the 2007 annual meeting of stockholders of
Parent.

5.19 _Working Capital_. The Working Capital of the Company shall be within
the Working Capital Range.

5.20 _Subsidiaries_. The Parties will take commercially reasonable actions
necessary to merge and/or dissolve the Company Subsidiaries listed on

concurrently with the Effective Time. Parent will be responsible for all fees
and expenses incurred by the Company in the performance of this Section 5.20.
The Parties acknowledge and agree that the fees and expenses incident to the

of determining the amount of the Permitted Dividend or the Companys Working
Capital.

time to time prior to the Closing to amend or supplement the Company
Schedules or the Parent Schedules, as the case may be, with respect to any
matter required to be set forth or described in such schedules by delivering
an amendment or supplement in writing to the other Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such update shall be deemed to amend or supplement the
Company Schedules or Parent Schedules for the purpose of (i) determining the
accuracy of any of the representations and warranties made by the Company or
the Parent in this Agreement, or (ii) determining whether any of the
conditions set forth in Article VI has been satisfied.

5.22 _Noncompetition Agreements_. Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure that each of the individuals listed on _Schedule
5.22_ shall have executed Parents standard form of noncompetition agreement,
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F (or such other mutually agreed form),
in connection with the Merger.

"Parent Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all losses, reductions
in value, costs, damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, other professionals and experts fees, costs of
investigation and court costs but net of any actual recovery by Parent in the
nature of insurance, indemnity or otherwise from third parties)
(collectively referred to as "Damages"), directly or indirectly arising out
of, resulting from or in connection with:

(i) any failure of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement or the Company Schedules, to be true and correct in all material
respects (except those representations and warranties contained in Sections
2.1, 2.2, 2.5, 2.7 and 2.21, which shall be true and correct in all respects)
as of the Closing Date as if made on the Closing Date (except those
representations and warranties that address matters only as of a particular
date, which shall be true and correct only as of such date);

(ii) any breach of or default in connection with any of the covenants or
agreements made by the Company in this Agreement;

(iii) any Excess Payments pursuant to Section 1.8(d); and

(iv) any Third Party Claim relating to any breach or failure referred to in
clause (i) through (iii) above.

7.3 _Limitations_.

(a) If the Merger is consummated, in no event shall the total recovery of the
Parent Indemnified Parties for indemnification under this Article VII exceed
(i) the total Merger Consideration that all Company Shareholders are entitled
to receive pursuant to Section 1.7(a) in respect of any claim for
indemnification that is made pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(i) as a result of any
failure of any representations and warranties of the Company contained in
Section 2.2 (Authority), Section 2.5 (Capitalization) and Section 2.16
(Taxes) or (ii) the Escrow Amount for all other claims for indemnification
made under this Article VII by the Parent Indemnified Parties, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no limitation
on the total recovery of the Parent Indemnified Parties for indemnification
under this Article VII in the case of fraud or intentional misrepresentation
by the Company. In determining the amount of any Damages in respect of the
failure of any representation or warranty to be true and correct as of any
particular date, any materiality or Material Adverse Effect standard contained
in such representation or warranty shall be disregarded. Subject to, and
except as otherwise provided in, the provisions of this Section 7.3(a), the
Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive remedy for any Damages arising out
of any all claims relating to the subject matter of this Agreement other than
claims made after the Escrow Termination Date but prior to the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations (as provided in Section 7.1). The
maximum amount that may be recovered from any single Company Shareholder
shall be limited to such Company Shareholders Proportionate Interest of the
aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration.



 

-68- (b) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary and except as
provided below, no Parent Indemnified Person may receive any portion of the
Escrow Amount in respect of any claim for indemnification unless and until
Damages in an aggregate amount greater than $1,000,000 (the "Deductible") have
been incurred, paid or properly accrued, and then only to the extent that
such aggregate amounts exceed the Deductible; _provided_ , that breach of
Section 5.1(a)(i) (Shares Issuable Upon Exercise) and Section 5.19 (Working
Capital) shall not be subject to the Deductible; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that for purposes of calculating Damages incurred in connection with a breach
of Section 5.1(a)(i), there shall be a credit applied to such Damages equal to
the value of the shares of Parent Common Stock not issued in connection with
the exercise of a Company Stock Option assumed by Parent pursuant to Section
5.1.

7.4 _Notice of Claim_.

(a) As used herein, the term "Claim" means a claim for indemnification of
Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person by a Company Shareholder for
Damages under this Article VII.

(b) Parent may give notice of a Claim under this Agreement, whether for its
own Damages or for Damages incurred by any other Parent Indemnified Person,
and Parent shall give written notice of a Claim executed by an officer of
Parent (a "Notice of Claim") to the Shareholder Representative (with a copy
to the Escrow Agent if the Claim involves recovery against the Escrow Amount)
promptly after Parent becomes aware of the existence of any potential claim by
any Parent Indemnified Person for indemnification from the Effective Time
under this Article VII, arising from or relating to:

(i) Any matter specified in Section 7.2; or

(ii) the assertion, whether orally or in writing, against Parent or any other
Parent Indemnified Person of a claim, demand, suit, action, arbitration,
investigation, inquiry or proceeding brought by a third party against Parent
or such other Parent Indemnified Person (in each such case, a "Third-Party
Claim") that is based on, arises out of or relates to any matter specified in
Section 7.2.

The period during which claims may be initiated (the "Claims Period") for
indemnification from the Escrow Amount shall commence at the Effective Time
and terminate on the Escrow Termination Date; provided, however, that the
Claims Period for indemnification from and against Damages arising out
of, resulting from or in connection with fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company shall commence at the Effective Time and
terminate upon the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.
Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, any Claims for
Damages specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the Shareholder
Representative prior to expiration of the applicable Claims Period with
respect to facts and circumstances existing prior to expiration of
the applicable Claims Period shall remain outstanding until such Claims for
Damages have been resolved or satisfied, notwithstanding the expiration of
such Claims Period.



 

-69- Until the expiration of the applicable Claims Period, no delay on the part of
Parent in giving the Shareholder Representative a Notice of Claim shall
relieve the Shareholder Representative from any of its obligations under this
Article VII unless (and then only to the extent that) the Shareholder
Representative or the Company Shareholders are materially prejudiced thereby.

7.5 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

(a) Parent shall determine and conduct the defense or settlement of any Third-
Party Claim, and the costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with
such defense or settlement (including reasonable attorneys fees, other
professionals and experts fees and court or arbitration costs) shall be
included in the Damages for which Parent may seek indemnification pursuant to
a Claim made by any Parent Indemnified Person hereunder.

(b) The Shareholder Representative shall have the right to receive copies of
all pleadings, notices and communications with respect to the Third-Party
Claim to the extent that receipt of such documents by the Shareholder
Representative does not affect any privilege relating to the Parent
Indemnified Person and may participate in, but not to determine or conduct,
any defense of the Third-Party Claim or settlement negotiations with respect
to the Third-Party Claim.

(c) No settlement of any such Third-Party Claim with any third party claimant
shall be determinative of the existence of or amount of Damages relating to
such matter, except with the consent of the Shareholder Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and which
shall be deemed to have been given unless the Shareholder Representative shall
have objected within 20 days after a written request for such consent by
Parent.

7.6 _Contents of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim by Parent given
pursuant to Section 7.4 shall contain the following information: 

(i) that Parent or another Parent Indemnified Person has directly or
indirectly incurred, paid or properly accrued or, in good faith, believes it
shall have to directly or indirectly incur, pay or accrue, Damages in an
aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim (which amount may be an
estimated amount and may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in
an action brought against any Parent Indemnified Person based on alleged
facts, which if true, would give rise to liability for Damages to such Parent
Indemnified Person under this Article VII);

(ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Parent), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to
the alleged Damages based on Parents good faith belief thereof, including
the identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably
available to Parent) and copies of any formal demand or complaint, the amount
of Damages (to the extent known), or the basis for such anticipated
liability, and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is
related; and

(iii) a statement that either (a) the Claims identified in such Notice of
Claim (together with Claims set forth in all Notices of Claims theretofore
delivered), individually or in the aggregate, do not satisfy the
Deductible, (b) the Claims identified in such Notice of Claim (together with
Claims set forth in all Notices of Claims theretofore delivered), individually
or in the aggregate, satisfy the Deductible or (c) that the Deductible does
not apply to such Claims.



 

-70- 7.7 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by Parent
shall be resolved as follows:

(a) If, within 30 days after a Notice of Claim is received by the Shareholder
Representative, the Shareholder Representative does not contest such Notice
of Claim in writing to Parent (with a copy to the Escrow Agent if the Claim
involves recovery against the Escrow Amount), the Shareholder Representative
shall be conclusively deemed to have consented, on behalf of all
Company Shareholders, to the recovery by the Parent Indemnified Person of the
full amount of Damages (subject to the limits contained in this Article VII)
specified in the Notice of Claim in accordance with this Article VII,
including the forfeiture of all or a portion of the Escrow Amount, and,
without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a final judgment
for damages against the Company Shareholders for such amount in any court
having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is proper.

(b) If the Shareholder Representative gives Parent written notice contesting
all or any portion of a Notice of Claim (a "Contested Claim") (with a copy to
the Escrow Agent) within the 30 day period specified in Section 7.7(a) above,
then such Contested Claim shall be resolved by either (i) a written settlement
agreement or memorandum executed by Parent and the Shareholder Representative
(a copy of which shall be furnished to the Escrow Agent) or (ii) in the
absence of such a written settlement agreement within 30 days following
receipt by Parent of the written notice from the Shareholder Representative,
by binding arbitration between Parent and the Shareholder Representative in
accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 7.7(c) below. The Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such memorandum or agreement and shall
distribute from the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the
memorandum or agreement.

(c) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation, either
Parent or the Shareholder Representative may, by written notice to the other,
demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or loss is at
issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event arbitration
shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both Parties agree
to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be settled by
arbitration conducted by three arbitrators, to be selected as follows: within
15 days after such written notice is sent, Parent (on the one hand) and the
Shareholder Representative (on the other hand) shall each select one
arbitrator, and the two arbitrators so selected shall select a third
arbitrator. The decision of the arbitrators as to the validity and amount of
any claim in any disputed Notice of Claim shall be binding and conclusive upon
the Parties to this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
act in accordance with such decision and make or withhold payments out of the
Escrow Amount in accordance with such decision.

(d) Judgment upon any award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be held in Chicago,
Illinois under the commercial rules then in effect of the American Arbitration
Association. The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own
expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of the American
Arbitration Association, and the expenses, including the reasonable attorneys
fees and costs, incurred by the prevailing party to the arbitration. The
arbitration panel shall be authorized to determine which party to the
arbitration is the prevailing party and which party is the non-prevailing
party.



 

-71- 7.8 _Release of Remaining Escrow Property_. Within 10 Business Days following
the Escrow Termination Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company
Shareholders all of the remaining Escrow Amount (if any) in excess of any
Escrow Amount that is necessary to satisfy all unresolved, unsatisfied or
disputed claims for Damages specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the
Shareholder Representative before the Escrow Termination Date. If any Claims
are unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of the expiration of the Claims
Period, then the Escrow Agent shall retain possession and custody of that
portion of the Escrow Amount that equals the total maximum amount of Damages
then being claimed by Parent Indemnified Persons in all such unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed Claims, and as soon as all such Claims have been
resolved, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Shareholders all of
the remaining Escrow Property (if any) not required to satisfy such Claims.

7.9 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments_. All payments (if any) made
to a Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to any indemnification obligations
under this Article VII will be treated as adjustments to the purchase price
for Tax purposes and such agreed treatment will govern for purposes of this
Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.

7.10  _Appointment of Representative_.

(a) By voting to adopt this Agreement and approve the Merger or participating
in the Merger and accepting the benefits thereof, each Company Shareholder
shall be deemed to have approved the designation of and designates the
Shareholder Representative as the representative of the Company Shareholders
and as the attorney-in-fact and agent for and on behalf of each Company
Shareholder with respect to claims for indemnification under this Article VII
and the taking by the Shareholder Representative of any and all actions and
the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by the
Shareholder Representative under this Agreement, including the exercise of the
power to: (a) give and receive notices and communications to or from Parent
(on behalf of itself or any other Parent Indemnified Person) and/or
the Escrow Agent relating to this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any of
the transactions and other matters contemplated hereby or thereby (except to
the extent that this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement expressly contemplates
that any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such
holders individually); (b) authorize the release or delivery to Parent of all
or a portion of the Escrow Amount in satisfaction of indemnification claims by
Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article VII
(including by not objecting to such claims); (c) agree to, object to,
negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand
arbitration or litigation of, and comply with orders of arbitrators or courts
with respect to, (i) indemnification claims by Parent or any other Parent
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article VII or (ii) any dispute between
any Parent Indemnified Person and any such holder, in each case relating to
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement; and (d) take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Representative for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. The Shareholder Representative shall have
authority and power to act on behalf of each Company Shareholder with respect
to the disposition, settlement or other handling of all claims under this
Article VII and all rights or obligations arising



 

-72- under this Article VII. The Company Shareholders shall be bound by all actions
taken and documents executed by the Shareholder Representative in connection
with this Article VII, and Parent and other Parent Indemnified Persons shall
be entitled to rely on any action or decision of the Shareholder
Representative. The Shareholder Representative may be replaced from time to
time by the holders of a majority in interest of the Escrow Amount then on
deposit with the Escrow Agent upon not less than 10 Business Days prior
written notice to Parent. No bond shall be required of the
Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall receive
no compensation for its services. Notices or communications to or from the
Shareholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Company Shareholders.

 

(b) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the Shareholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Company Shareholder in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Shareholder
Representative. Each Company Shareholder shall severally (based on each such
holders Proportionate Interest), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Shareholder Representative from and against any loss, liability or
expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of
the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of its duties hereunder, including any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably
incurred by the Shareholder Representative. If not paid directly to the
Shareholder Representative by the Company Shareholders, such losses,
liabilities or expenses may be recovered by the Shareholder Representative
from Escrow Amount otherwise distributable to the Company Shareholders (and
not distributed or distributable to any Parent Indemnified Person or subject
to a pending indemnification claim of any Parent Indemnified Person) following
the Escrow Termination Date pursuant to the terms hereof and of the Escrow
Agreement, at the time of distribution, and such recovery will be made from
the Company Shareholders according to their respective Proportionate
Interests.

Party, if: (i) the Effective Time has not occurred by October 31, 2006 as a
result of a condition to Closing not having been satisfied prior to such date

to fulfill any obligation hereunder has been the cause of, or resulted in, the
failure of the Effective Time to occur on or before such date and such action
or failure constitutes a breach of this Agreement); (ii) there shall be a
final nonappealable order of a federal or state court in effect preventing
consummation of the Merger; or (iii) there shall be any statute, rule,

the Merger by any Governmental Entity that would make consummation of the
Merger illegal;



 

-73- (c) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule,
regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to
the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit Parents or

Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or hold separate,
as a result of the Merger, any portion of the business or assets of the
Company or Parent;

this Agreement and there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of the Company
and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or
Section 6.3(b), as the case may be, would not then be satisfied or if there
has been any breach of Section 4.2; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such

Days through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then for so long
as the Company continues to exercise such commercially reasonable efforts
Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)
unless such breach is not cured within 15 Business Days (but no cure period
shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured); or

(e) by the Company if it is not in material breach of its obligations pursuant
to this Agreement and there has been a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub and as a result of such breach the
conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section 6.2(b), as the case may be,

Days through the exercise of commercially reasonable efforts, then for so long
as Parent or Merger Sub continues to exercise such commercially reasonable
efforts the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section
8.1(e) unless such breach is not cured within 15 Business Days (but no cure
period shall be required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured).

Where action is taken to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
it shall be sufficient for such action to be authorized by the board of
directors of the Party taking such action.

8.2 _Effect of Termination_. Except as set forth in Section 8.1, any
termination of this Agreement under Section 8.1 above will be effective
immediately upon the delivery of written notice of the terminating Party to

provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or
effect, except (a) as set forth in this Section 8.2 and Article IX (general
provisions, including expenses), each of which shall survive the termination
of this Agreement, and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any Party from
liability for any breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the Parties contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

8.3 [RESERVED].

8.4 _Amendment_. Except as is otherwise required by applicable law, prior to
the Closing, this Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any time by

Shareholders without the further approval of the Company Shareholders. Except
as is otherwise required by applicable law, after the Closing, this Agreement
may be amended by the Parties at any time by execution of an instrument in
writing executed by the Shareholder Representative in the case of the
Company.

counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered to the other Party, it being understood that all
Parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

9.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the Parties as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Schedules and the
Parent Schedules (a) constitute the entire agreement among the Parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements
and understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality

Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the Parties. The Parties further agree to

economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

9.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise provided
herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a Party will be
deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby,
or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of any one
remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The Parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed by the Parties that Parent
shall be entitled to an immediate injunction or injunctions, without the
necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy and without
the necessity of posting any bond or other security, to prevent breaches of
the provisions of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which Parent may
be entitled at law or in equity.

9.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed

plead any objection that they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction, venue
and process.

9.9 _Rules of Construction_. The Parties agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule
of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document
will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document.

9.10  _Assignment_. No Party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other Parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

_[signature page to Action of the Majority of the Shareholders of CipherTrust,
Inc.] _ Exhibit B

ESCROW AGREEMENT

This Escrow Agreement (this "Agreement"), dated as of August [ _ _], 2006
(the "Closing Date"), is entered into by and among Secure Computing
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), CT Shareholders Representative
LLC, the entity (the "Shareholders Representative") appointed to act as
representative of the shareholders of CipherTrust, Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the "Acquired Company"), and  _ _, or its
successor as provided in Section 5(i) hereof, each as escrow agent ("Escrow
Agent"). Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, shall have
the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in that certain Agreement and
Plan of Merger, dated July 11, 2006 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among
Buyer, Peach Acquisition Corp., a Georgia corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Buyer (the "Acquisition Subsidiary"), the Acquired Company and
the Shareholders Representative. 

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Buyer will acquire all of the
equity securities of the Acquired Company for cash and stock through a
reverse subsidiary merger of the Acquisition Subsidiary with and into the
Acquired Company on the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement;

WHEREAS, the Shareholders Representative is the agent and representative of
the shareholders of the Acquired Company (the "Shareholders"), and has the
full power, authority and discretion, to act for and on behalf of the
Shareholders in regards to the Shareholders rights under this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement including the resolution of all claims for
indemnification under the Merger Agreement; and

WHEREAS, this Agreement is entered into pursuant to _Section 1.7(c)_ of the
Merger Agreement to establish a source of funds for the indemnification
obligations of the Shareholders which may arise pursuant to _Article VII_ of
the Merger Agreement;

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally
bound, hereby agree as follows:

1\. ESTABLISHMENT OF ESCROW

(a) On the Closing Date, Buyer shall deposit with Escrow Agent (i)
$18,500,000 by wire transfer in immediately available funds (the "Escrow
Cash") to the account of Escrow Agent referenced on _Schedule A_ hereto, and
(ii) a stock certificate (as such certificate may be canceled and reissued in
accordance with _Section 3(a)_, the "Escrow Stock Certificate") issued in the
name of the Shareholders Representative representing 1,000,000 shares of the
Buyers common stock (as such shares may be reduced in accordance with
_Section 3(a)_, the "Escrow Stock"), and Escrow Agent shall acknowledge
receipt of the Escrow Cash and the Escrow Stock. The Escrow Cash (together with any earnings thereon) and the Escrow Stock (together with any
dividends or other distributions payable with respect thereto), as they may
be reduced by any Claims, disbursements, amounts withdrawn under _Section
5(j)_ or losses on investments, are collectively referred to in this Agreement
as the "Escrow Fund."

(b) Buyer and the Shareholders Representative hereby appoint Escrow Agent as
escrow agent under this Agreement, and Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as
escrow agent to hold, safeguard and disburse the Escrow Fund pursuant to the
terms and conditions hereof. The Escrow Fund shall be held by Escrow Agent in
separate accounts maintained for such purpose.

(c) The Escrow Stock will be reflected as issued and outstanding shares on the
Buyers balance sheet. All dividends paid by the Buyer, if any, with respect
to the Escrow stock shall be distributed by the Escrow Agent to the
Shareholders within [30] business days following receipt of such dividend by
the Escrow Agent, with each Shareholder to receive an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of such dividend, multiplied by the percentage set forth
opposite such Shareholders name under the heading "Escrow Stock Percentage"
on _Schedule C_ hereto. The Shareholders Representative will have voting
rights with respect to the Escrow Stock so long as such Escrow Stock is held
in escrow, and Parent shall take all reasonable steps necessary to allow the
exercise of such rights. While the Escrow Stock remains in the Escrow Agents
possession pursuant to this Agreement, the Shareholders Representative will
retain and will be able to exercise all other incidents of ownership of said
Escrow Stock which are not inconsistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. Subject to the rights of Parent under the Merger Agreement and this
Escrow Agreement, all beneficial interest in the Escrow Stock shall be the
property of the Shareholders Representative from and after the Closing,
and Parent shall have no interest therein. None of the rights of the
Shareholders Representative hereunder shall be transferable except as
otherwise provided by law.

(d) The Escrow Fund will not be available to set off any obligations the
Shareholders Representative or Buyer owes to Escrow Agent in any capacity,
except as expressly provided in this Agreement.

2\. INVESTMENT OF ESCROW CASH

Escrow Agent shall invest the Escrow Cash as Buyer and the Shareholders
Representative may from time to time jointly instruct Escrow Agent in writing
in (i) savings accounts with, or certificates of deposit issued by, federally
chartered banks or trust companies, the assets of which are at least
$100,000,000 in excess of their liabilities, (ii) United States Treasury Bills
(or an investment portfolio or fund investing only in United States Treasury
Bills), (iii) commercial paper rated in the highest grade by a nationally
recognized credit rating agency or (iv) an STI Classic Money Market Fund (as
long as such money market fund is rated AAA by a nationally recognized credit
rating agency), until disbursement of all the Escrow Cash. Unless instructed
otherwise in writing, Escrow Agent shall invest all the Escrow Cash in an STI
Classic Money Market Fund. The Escrow Agent shall have no liability for any
loss or diminution in the Escrow Cash resulting from investments made in
accordance with the provisions of this



  

\- 2 - Agreement. All income from such investments shall be reinvested and held by
Escrow Agent as a part of the Escrow Cash. Escrow Agent is authorized to
liquidate in accordance with its customary procedures any portion of the
Escrow Fund consisting of investments to provide for payments required to be
made under this Agreement.

3\. CLAIMS

(a) During the Survival Period, Buyer may give written notice (a "Notice of
Claim") to the Shareholders Representative and Escrow Agent specifying in
reasonable detail the nature and dollar amount of any claim (a "Claim")
it may have under _Article VII_ of the Merger Agreement; Buyer may make more
than one claim with respect to any underlying state of facts. If the
Shareholders Representative gives written notice to Escrow Agent disputing
any Claim (a "Contested Claim") within 30 calendar days following receipt by
Escrow Agent of the Notice of Claim, such Claim shall be resolved as provided
in _Section 3(c)_ of this Agreement. If no Contested Claim is received by
Escrow Agent within such 30 calendar-day period, then the dollar amount of
damages claimed by Buyer (the "Claim Amount") as set forth in its Notice of
Claim shall be deemed established for purposes of this Agreement and the
Merger Agreement, and Escrow Agent shall pay the claim in accordance with
_Section 3(b)_. Escrow Agent shall not inquire into or consider whether a
Claim complies with the requirements of the Merger Agreement. As used herein,
"Survival Period" means the 15-month period following the date of this
Agreement

(b) At the end of the 30 calendar-day period set forth in _Section 3(a)_ (or
within 30 calendar days following receipt of joint written instructions of
Buyer and the Shareholders Representative or notice of a Final Decision, as
the case may be), Escrow Agent shall pay the applicable Claim as follows:

(i) An amount equal to [__]% [NOTE: Cash and stock to be disbursed by Escrow
Agent will be in the same proportion as such forms of consideration
constitute the initial Escrow Fund] of the Claim Amount will be wire
transferred in immediately available funds out of the Escrow Cash to an
account designated by Buyer.

(ii) Escrow Agent shall surrender the Escrow Stock Certificate to Wells Fargo
Bank Shareowner Services, Buyers exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent"), for
cancellation. The Exchange Agent will deliver a new Escrow Stock Certificate
to the Escrow Agent, issued to the Shareholders Representative, representing
the number of shares of Buyers common stock equal to (x) the number of
shares of Buyers common stock represented by the canceled Escrow Stock
Certificate _minus_ (y) the number of shares of Buyers common stock obtained
by dividing (1) the product of [__]% and the Claim Amount by (2) the price
per share of Buyers common stock as of the day immediately preceding the day
the Claim is paid. Upon the request of the Escrow Agent, Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative will deliver a joint written instruction to the
Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent setting forth the number of shares of
Buyers common stock represented by the Claim Amount as well as the number of
shares of Buyers common stock for which the new Escrow Stock Certificate
will be issued.



 

\- 3 - (c) If a Contested Claim is received by Escrow Agent as provided in  _Section
3(a)_ of this Agreement with respect to a Claim, Escrow Agent shall make
payment with respect thereto only in accordance with (i) joint written
instructions of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative or (ii) a written
notification from Buyer of a final decision, order, judgment or decree of an
arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction (a "Final Decision"), which
notification shall attach a copy of such Final Decision.

(d) All disbursements made by Escrow Agent pursuant to this _Section 3_ shall
be made (i) in the case of the Escrow Cash, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts designated in writing to Escrow
Agent by Buyer, or (ii) in the case of the Escrow Stock, by surrendering to
the Buyer the Escrow Stock Certificate for cancellation and reissuance
pursuant to _Section 3(b)(ii)_.



 

\- 4 - 4\. TERMINATION OF ESCROW

(a) Within 10 business days following the termination of the Survival Period,
Escrow Agent shall pay and distribute any then-remaining amount of the Escrow
Fund to the Shareholders as follows:

(i) With respect to the Escrow Cash, subject to  _Section 4(b)_, Escrow
Agent shall pay to each Shareholder an amount equal to such Shareholders
percentage interest in the Escrow Cash as set forth opposite such
Shareholders name under the heading "Escrow Cash Percentage" on _Schedule B_
hereto. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, any Excess Escrow
Cash (as defined below) shall not be distributed to the Shareholders, but
shall be distributed to the Buyer. As used herein, "Excess Escrow Cash" means
any Escrow Cash in excess of an amount equal to the sum of (i) $18,500,000
plus (ii) an amount calculated in a manner similar to interest at a rate of
15% per annum, compounded annually, on a notional principal amount of
$18,500,000, calculated from the Effective Time through the date that the
Escrow Cash otherwise would be distributable to the Shareholders.

(ii) With respect to the Escrow Stock, Escrow Agent shall surrender the Escrow
Stock Certificate to the Exchange Agent for cancellation. The Exchange Agent
shall reissue stock certificates representing shares of Buyers common stock
to each Shareholder set forth on _Schedule C_ hereto. Subject to _Section
4(b)_, the Exchange Agent shall issue to each such Shareholder the number of
shares of Buyers common stock obtained by multiplying the then-remaining
Escrow Stock by the percentage set forth opposite such Shareholders name
under the heading "Escrow Stock Percentage" on  _Schedule C_ hereto.



 

\- 5 - (b) Notwithstanding _Section 4(a)_, if any unresolved, unsatisfied or
disputed Claims are pending at the expiration of the Survival Period (the
"Pending Claims"), the Escrow Agent shall retain the following from the Escrow
Fund:

(i) With respect to the Escrow Cash, an amount equal to [__]% of the total
maximum dollar value of the Pending Claims, together with any earnings
attributable to such amounts.

(ii) With respect to the Escrow Stock, the Escrow Agent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to issue to the Escrow Agent a stock certificate representing
the number of shares of Buyers common stock equal to the value of [__]% of
the total maximum dollar value of the Pending Claims, with a pro rata
reduction in each of the stock certificates to be issued to the Shareholders
pursuant to _Section 4(a)(ii)_. Upon the request of the Escrow Agent, Buyer
and the Shareholders Representative will deliver a joint written instruction
to the Exchange Agent and the Escrow Agent setting forth the number of shares
of Buyers common stock represented by the Pending Claims, the number of
shares of Buyers common stock for which the new Escrow Stock Certificate will
be issued, and the number of shares of Buyers common stock to be issued to
the Shareholders.

Upon receipt by Escrow Agent of the joint written instructions of Buyer and
the Shareholders Representative or notice of a Final Decision as contemplated
by _Section 3(c)_ of this Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall disburse the
remaining Escrow Fund in accordance with _Section 4(a)_. 

(c) All disbursements of Escrow Cash made by Escrow Agent pursuant to this
_Section 4_ shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account or accounts designated in writing to Escrow Agent by Buyer or the
Shareholders Representative, as applicable. The Escrow Agent shall have no
liability with respect to the transfer or distribution of any funds or stock
effected by the Escrow Agent pursuant to wiring or transfer instructions
provided to the Escrow Agent by any party to this Agreement.

5\. DUTIES OF ESCROW AGENT

(a) Escrow Agent undertakes to perform only such duties as are expressly set
forth herein and no duties shall be implied. Escrow Agent shall have no
liability under and no duty to take notice of or inquire as to the provisions
of any agreement (including but not limited to the Merger Agreement) other
than this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or
omitted by it in good faith except to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines that Escrow Agents gross negligence or willful
misconduct was the primary cause of any loss to Buyer or the Shareholders
Representative. Escrow Agents sole responsibility shall be for the
safekeeping and disbursement of the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Escrow Agent shall have no implied duties or obligations
and shall not be charged with knowledge or notice of any fact or circumstance
not specifically set forth herein. Escrow Agent may rely upon any notice,
instruction, request or other instrument, not only as to its due execution,
validity and effectiveness, but also as to the truth and accuracy of any
information contained therein, which Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe to
be genuine and to have been signed or presented by Buyer and/or the
Shareholders Representative. In no event shall Escrow Agent be liable for
incidental, indirect, special,



 

\- 6 - consequential or punitive damages (including, but not limited to lost
profits), even if Escrow Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such
loss or damage and regardless of the form of action. Escrow Agent shall not be
obligated to take any legal action or commence any proceeding in connection
with the Escrow Fund, any account in which Escrow Cash is deposited, this
Agreement or the Merger Agreement, or to appear in, prosecute or defend any
such legal action or proceeding. Escrow Agent may consult legal counsel
selected by it in the event of any dispute or question as to the construction
of any of the provisions hereof or of its duties hereunder, or relating to
any dispute hereunder, and shall incur no liability and shall be fully
indemnified from any liability whatsoever in acting in accordance with the
opinion or advice of such counsel. Buyer shall promptly pay, upon demand, the
reasonable fees and expenses of any such counsel.

Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole discretion, to comply with orders
issued or process entered by any court with respect to the Escrow Fund,
without determination by Escrow Agent of such courts jurisdiction in the
matter. If any portion of the Escrow Fund is at any time attached, garnished
or levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall
be made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof,
then and in any such event, Escrow Agent is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to rely upon and comply with any such order, writ, judgment or
decree which it is advised by legal counsel selected by it is binding upon it
without the need for appeal or other action; and if Escrow Agent complies with
any such order, writ, judgment or decree, it shall not be liable to any of
Buyer or the Shareholders Representative or to any other person or entity by
reason of such compliance even though such order, writ, judgment or decree may
be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

(b) From and at all times after the date of this Agreement, Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative, jointly and severally, shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, defend, indemnify and hold harmless Escrow Agent and
each director, officer, employee, attorney, agent and affiliate of Escrow
Agent (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") against any and all actions,
claims (whether or not valid), losses, damages, liabilities, reasonable costs
and reasonable expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever (including without
limitation reasonable attorneys fees, costs and expenses) incurred by
or asserted against any of the Indemnified Parties from and after the date
hereof, whether direct, indirect or consequential, as a result of or arising
from or in any way relating to any claim, demand, suit, action or proceeding
(including any inquiry or investigation) by any person, including without
limitation Buyer or the Shareholders Representative, whether threatened or
initiated, asserting a claim for any legal or equitable remedy against any
Indemnified Parties under any statute or regulation, including, but not
limited to, any federal or state securities laws, or under any common law or
equitable cause or otherwise, arising directly or indirectly from or in
connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, performance or
failure of performance of this Agreement or any transactions contemplated
herein, whether or not any such Indemnified Party is a party to any such
action, proceeding, suit or the target of any such inquiry or investigation;
_provided, however,_ that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be
indemnified hereunder for any liability finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction, subject



 

\- 7 - to no further appeal, to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful
misconduct of such Indemnified Party. Each Indemnified Party shall, in its
sole discretion, have the right to select and employ separate counsel with
respect to any action or claim brought or asserted against it, and the
reasonable fees of such counsel shall be paid upon demand by Buyer. The
obligations of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative under this _Section
5(b)_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of Escrow Agent.

(c) Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any losses, liabilities, claims,
actions, damages or expenses arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, unless arising out of Escrow Agents own gross negligence or
willful misconduct. Without limiting the foregoing, Escrow Agent shall in no
event be liable in connection with its investment or reinvestment of any cash
held by it hereunder in good faith, in accordance with the terms hereof,
including, without limitation, any liability for any delays (not resulting
from its gross negligence or willful misconduct) in the investment or
reinvestment of the Escrow Fund, or any loss of interest incident to any such
delays.

(d) Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon any order,
judgment, certification, demand, notice, instrument or other writing
delivered to it hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity
or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity of
the service thereof. Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature reasonably believed by it to be genuine and may assume that the
person purporting to give receipt or advice or make any statement or execute
any document on behalf of Buyer or the Shareholders Representative in
connection with the provisions hereof has been duly authorized to do so.
Escrow Agent may conclusively presume that the undersigned representative of
any party hereto which is an entity other than a natural person has full
power and authority to instruct Escrow Agent on behalf of that party unless
written notice to the contrary is delivered to Escrow Agent.

(e) Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of counsel with respect to any
matter relating to this Agreement and shall not be liable for any action taken
or omitted by it in good faith in accordance with such advice.

(f) Escrow Agent does not have any interest in the Escrow Fund deposited
hereunder but is serving as escrow holder only and having only possession
thereof. Any payments of income from this Escrow Fund shall be subject to
withholding regulations then in force with respect to any Tax. On or before
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Shareholders
Representative, on behalf of the Shareholders, will provide Escrow Agent with
appropriate Internal Revenue Service Forms W-9 for tax identification number
certification or applicable Forms W-8 in the case of non-U.S. persons.
This Section 5(f) of this Agreement shall survive notwithstanding any
termination of this Agreement or the resignation of Escrow Agent.

(g) Escrow Agent makes no representation as to the validity, value,
genuineness or the collectability of any security or other document or
instrument held by or delivered to it.



 

\- 8 - (h) Escrow Agent shall not be called upon to advise any party as to the wisdom
in selling or retaining or taking or refraining from any action with respect
to any securities or other property deposited hereunder.

(i) Escrow Agent (and any successor Escrow Agent) may at any time resign as
such by delivering the Escrow Fund to any successor Escrow Agent jointly
designated by the other parties hereto in writing, or to any court of
competent jurisdiction, whereupon Escrow Agent shall be discharged of and
from any and all further obligations arising in connection with this
Agreement. The resignation of Escrow Agent will take effect on the earlier of
(a) the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent (including a court of
competent jurisdiction) or (b) the day which is 30 calendar days after the
date of delivery of its written notice of resignation to Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative. If at that time Escrow Agent has not received a
designation of a successor Escrow Agent, Escrow Agents sole responsibility
after that time shall be to retain and safeguard the Escrow Fund until receipt
of a designation of successor Escrow Agent, a joint written disposition
instruction by the other parties hereto or notice from Buyer of a Final
Decision, or Escrow Agents deposit of the Escrow Fund into the registry of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

(j) In the event of any disagreement between the other parties hereto
resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with the
Escrow Fund or in the event that Escrow Agent is in doubt as to what action it
should take hereunder, Escrow Agent shall be entitled to retain the Escrow
Fund until Escrow Agent shall have received (i) a notice from Buyer of a
Final Decision directing delivery of the Escrow Fund or (ii) a written
agreement executed by the other parties hereto directing delivery of the
Escrow Fund, in which event Escrow Agent shall disburse the Escrow Fund in
accordance with such Final Decision or agreement. In the event of any such
disagreement as described above, Escrow Agent shall have the right, in
addition to the rights described above and at the election of Escrow Agent, to
tender into the registry or custody of any court having jurisdiction, all
money and property comprising the Escrow Fund and may take such other legal
action as may be appropriate or necessary, in the opinion of Escrow Agent.
Upon such tender, the parties hereto agree that Escrow Agent shall
be discharged from all further duties under this Agreement; _provided,
however,_ that the filing of any such legal proceedings shall not deprive
Escrow Agent of its compensation hereunder earned prior to such filing and
discharge of Escrow Agent of its duties hereunder.

(k) Buyer and the Shareholders Representative shall compensate Escrow Agent
for its services hereunder in accordance with _Schedule A_ attached hereto
and, in addition, shall reimburse Escrow Agent for all of its reasonable out-
of-pocket expenses, including attorneys fees, travel expenses, telephone and
facsimile transmission costs, postage (including express mail and overnight
delivery charges), copying charges and the like. All of the compensation and
reimbursement obligations set forth in this _Section 5(k)_ shall be payable
50% by Buyer and 50% by the Shareholders Representative upon demand by
Escrow Agent. The obligations of Buyer and the Shareholders Representative
under this _Section 5(k)_ shall survive any termination of this Agreement and
the resignation or removal of Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent is authorized to,
and may, disburse to itself from the Escrow Fund, from time to time, the
amount of any



 

\- 9 - compensation and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses due and payable
hereunder (including any amount to which Escrow Agent or any Indemnified
Party is entitled to seek indemnification pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ hereof)
after providing 10 business-days prior written notice to Buyer and the
Shareholders representative. Escrow Agent shall notify Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative of any disbursement from the Escrow Fund to
itself or any Indemnified Party in respect of any compensation or
reimbursement hereunder and shall furnish to Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative copies of all related invoices and other
statements. Buyer and the Shareholders Representative hereby grant to Escrow
Agent and the Indemnified Parties a security interest in and lien upon the
Escrow Fund to secure all obligations with respect to the right to offset the
amount of any compensation or reimbursement due any of them hereunder
(including any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section 5(b)_ hereof)
against the Escrow Fund. If for any reason funds in the Escrow Fund are
insufficient to cover such compensation and reimbursement, Buyer and the
Shareholders Representative jointly and severally agree promptly to pay such
amounts to Escrow Agent or any Indemnified Party upon receipt of a complete
and accurate itemized invoice.

(l) The other parties hereto authorize Escrow Agent, for any securities held
hereunder, to use the services of any United States central securities
depository it reasonably deems appropriate, including, without limitation, the
Depositary Trust Company and the Federal Reserve Book Entry System.

6\. LIMITED RESPONSIBILITY

This Agreement expressly sets forth all the duties of Escrow Agent with
respect to any and all matters pertinent hereto. No implied duties or
obligations shall be read into this agreement against Escrow Agent. Escrow
Agent shall not be bound by the provisions of any agreement among the other
parties hereto except this Agreement.

7\. OWNERSHIP FOR TAX PURPOSES

The Buyer and the Shareholders Representative agree that, for purposes of any
Tax, the Buyer will be treated as the owner of the Escrow Cash, including all
income, if any, that is earned on, or derived from, the Escrow Cash until such
time as such Escrow Cash is distributed to the Buyer or the Shareholders
Representative, and that the Buyer will include such income, if any, in
its taxable income in the taxable year or years in which such income is
properly includible and pay any Taxes attributable thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Buyer shall be reimbursed from the Escrow Fund for the
payment of such taxes as follows: (i) not later than seven Business Days
prior to each of April 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15 (each, an
"Estimated Tax Date"), Escrow Agent shall provide the Buyer with an estimate
of the taxable income attributable to the Escrow Fund for the Buyers
estimated tax period ending immediately prior to the Estimated Tax Date; (ii)
not later than five Business Days prior to the Estimated Tax Date, the Buyer
shall provide the Escrow Agent with a schedule setting forth the amount of
taxes payable by the Buyer with respect to such taxable income, taking into
account the highest marginal federal, state and local tax rates applicable to
the Buyer for such tax period and the deductibility of state and local income
taxes for U.S. federal income tax purposes; and (iii) not later than three
Business Days prior to the Estimated Tax Date, the Escrow Agent shall



 

\- 10 - release to an account designated by the Buyer an amount, in cash, equal to
such taxes payable by the Buyer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein provided, Escrow Agent shall have no duty to prepare or file any Tax
Return with respect to the Escrow Fund or any income earned thereon.

2 Exhibit E

_SECURE COMPUTING CORPORATION_

EMPLOYMENT, CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION,

INVENTION ASSIGNMENT, AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT

As a condition of my employment with SECURE COMPUTING CORPORATION, its
subsidiaries, affiliates, successors or assigns (together the "Company"), and
in consideration of my employment with the Company and my receipt of the
compensation now and hereafter paid to me by Company, I agree to the
following:

1\. _At-Will Employment/Termination of Employment_.

(a) I UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT MY EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY IS FOR AN
UNSPECIFIED DURATION AND CONSTITUTES "AT-WILL" EMPLOYMENT. I ALSO UNDERSTAND
THAT ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS UNAUTHORIZED AND NOT VALID UNLESS
OBTAINED IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF THE COMPANY.
I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP MAY BE TERMINATED AT ANY
TIME, WITH OR WITHOUT GOOD CAUSE OR FOR ANY OR NO CAUSE, AT THE OPTION EITHER
OF THE COMPANY OR MYSELF, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.



   (b) | The Company shall have the right, on written notice to you, 
---|--- 



     | (i) | to terminate your employment immediately at any time for
cause, or 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | to terminate your employment at any time without cause
provided the Company shall be obligated in either case to pay to you as
severance an amount equal to six months base salary less applicable taxes
and other required withholdings and any amount you may owe to the Company,
payable in full immediately upon such termination. Such severance payment
shall be contingent upon you signing a Separation and Release Agreement in a
form satisfactory to the Company which assures, among other things, that you
will not commence any type of litigation or other claims as a result of the
termination. 
---|---|--- 

(c) For purposes of this Section, you may be terminated for cause if, in the
reasonable determination of the Companys Chief Executive Officer (CEO), you
are convicted of any felony or of any crime involving moral turpitude, or
participate in fraud against the Company, or intentionally damage any property
of the Company, or wrongfully disclose any trade secrets or other confidential
information of the Company to any of its competitors, or materially breach
Section 2 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement.

2\. _Confidential Information_.

(a) _Company Information_. I agree at all times during the term of my
employment and thereafter, to hold in strictest confidence, and not to use or
disclose, except for the benefit of the Company, or to disclose to any person,
firm or corporation without written authorization of the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company, any Confidential Information of the Company. I
understand that "Confidential Information" means any Company proprietary
information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how, including, but not
limited to, research, product plans, products, services, customer lists and
customers (including, but not limited to, customers of the Company on whom I
called or with whom I became acquainted during the term of my employment),
markets, software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology,
designs, drawings, engineering data, hardware configuration information,
marketing, financial or other business information disclosed to me by the
Company either directly or indirectly in writing, orally or by drawings or
observation of parts or equipment. I further understand that
Confidential Information does not include any of the foregoing items which
has become publicly known and made generally available through no wrongful act
of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to the item
or items involved or improvements or new versions thereof.

(b) _Former Employer Information_. I agree that I will not, during my
employment with the Company, improperly use or disclose any proprietary
information or trade secrets of any former or concurrent employer or other
person or entity and that I will not bring onto the premises of the Company
any unpublished document or proprietary information belonging to any such
employer, person or entity unless consented to in writing by such employer,
person or entity. (c) _Third Party Information_. I recognize that the Company has received and
in the future will receive from third parties their confidential or
proprietary information subject to a duty on the Companys part to maintain
the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited
purposes. I agree to hold all such confidential or proprietary information in
the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm or
corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying out my work for the
Company consistent with the Companys agreement with such third party.

3\. _Inventions_.

(a) _Inventions Retained and Licensed_. I have attached hereto, as _Exhibit
A_, a list describing all inventions, original works of authorship,
developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to
my employment with the Company (collectively referred to as "Prior
Inventions"), which belong to me, which relate to the Companys proposed
business, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to
the Company hereunder; or, if no such list is attached, I represent that
there are no such Prior Inventions. If in the course of my employment with the
Company, I incorporate into a Company product, process or machine a Prior
Invention owned by me or in which I have an interest, the Company is hereby
granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual,
worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior
Invention as part of or in connection with such product, process or machine.

(b) _Assignment of Inventions_. I agree that I will promptly make full written
disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit
of the Company, and hereby assign to the Company, or its designee, all my
right, title, and interest in and to any and all inventions, original works of
authorship, developments, concepts, improvements, designs, discoveries,
ideas, trademarks or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable
under copyright or similar laws, which I may solely or jointly conceive or
develop or reduce to practice, or cause to be conceived or developed or
reduced to practice, during the period of time I am in the employ of the
Company (collectively referred to as "Inventions"), except as provided in
Section 3(f) below. I further acknowledge that all original works
of authorship which are made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the
scope of and during the period of my employment with the Company and which are
protectible by copyright are "works made for hire," as that term is defined in
the United States Copyright Act. I understand and agree that the decision
whether or not to commercialize or market any invention developed by me solely
or jointly with others is within the Companys sole discretion and for the
Companys sole benefit and that no royalty will be due to me as a result of
the Companys efforts to commercialize or market any such invention.

(c)  _Inventions Assigned to the United States_. I agree to assign to the
United States government all my right, title, and interest in and to any and
all Inventions whenever such full title is required to be in the United States
by a contract between the Company and the United States or any of its
agencies.

(d) _Maintenance of Records_. I agree to keep and maintain adequate and
current written records of all Inventions made by me (solely or jointly with
others) during the term of my employment with the Company. The records will be
in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, and any other format that may be
specified by the Company. The records will be available to and remain the sole
property of the Company at all times.

(e) _Patent and Copyright Registrations_. I agree to assist the Company, or
its designee, at the Companys expense, in every proper way to secure the
Companys rights in the Inventions and any copyrights, patents, mask work
rights or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all
countries, including the disclosure to the Company of all pertinent
information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications,
specifications, oaths, assignments and all other instruments which the
Company shall deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain such rights and
in order to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and
nominees the sole and exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such
Inventions, and any copyrights, patents, mask work rights or other
intellectual property rights relating thereto. I further agree that my
obligation to execute or cause to be executed, when it is in my power to do
so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of
this Agreement. If the Company is unable because of my mental or physical
incapacity or for any other reason to secure my signature to apply for or to
pursue any application for any United States or foreign patents or copyright
registrations covering Inventions or original works of authorship assigned to
the Company as above, then I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the
Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney
in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such
applications and to do all other lawfully permitted acts to further the
prosecution and issuance of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon
with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.

(f) _Exception to Assignments_. I understand that the provisions of
this Agreement requiring assignment of Inventions to the Company do not apply
to any invention for which no equipment, supplies, facility or trade secret
information of the Company was used and which is developed entirely on my own
time and (i) does not relate directly or indirectly to the Companys business
or to its actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development; or (ii)
does not result from any work performed by me for the Company.



 

2 4\. _Conflicting Employment_. I agree that, during the term of my employment
with the Company, I will not engage in any other employment, occupation,
consulting or other business activity directly related to the business in
which the Company is now involved or becomes involved during the term of my
employment, nor will I engage in any other activities that conflict with my
obligations to the Company.

5\. _Returning Company Documents_. I agree that, at the time of leaving the
employ of the Company, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my
possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and all devices, records,
data, notes, reports, proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications,
drawings blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, other documents or
property, or reproductions of any aforementioned items developed by me
pursuant to my employment with the Company or otherwise belonging to the
Company, its successors or assigns, including, without limitation, those
records maintained pursuant to paragraph 3(d). In the event of the termination
of my employment, I agree to sign and deliver the "Termination Certification"
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_.

6\. _Notification of New Employer_. In the event that I leave the employ of
the Company, I hereby grant consent to notification by the Company to my
new employer about my rights and obligations under this Agreement.

7\. _Covenant Not to Compete_. To the full extent permitted by law, I agree
that during the course of my employment with Secure Computing and for a
period of twelve (12) months after the termination of my employment (whether
voluntary or involuntary), I will not directly or indirectly solicit, offer to
provide, or provide any services similar to those Secure Computing offers to
any individual or entity with whom I worked during the last twelve (12) months
of my employment with Secure Computing or for any for any individual or entity
which is directly or indirectly competitive with Secure Computings business,
unless I have written consent of Secure Computing.

8\. _Non-solicitation_. 

(a) _Non-solicitation of Employees_. To the full extent permitted by law, for
a period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of my
relationship with the Company for any reason, whether voluntary or
involuntary, I shall not, by myself or in collaboration with others, either
directly or indirectly solicit, induce, recruit or encourage any of
the Companys employees to leave their employment, or take away such
employees, or attempt to solicit, induce, recruit, encourage or take away
employees of the Company, either for myself or any other person or entity.

(b) _Non-solicitation of Business_. To the full extent permitted by law, for a
period of twelve (12) months immediately following the termination of my
relationship with the Company for any reason, whether voluntary or
involuntary, I will not divert or attempt to divert from the Company any
business the Company had enjoyed or solicited from its customers or potential
customers during the twelve (12) months prior to my termination of
employment.

9\. _Representations_. I agree to execute any proper oath or verify any
proper document required to carry out the terms of this Agreement. I represent
that my performance of all the terms of this Agreement will not breach any
agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by me in
confidence or in trust prior to my employment by the Company. I have not
entered into, and I agree I will not enter into, any oral or written agreement
in conflict herewith.

10\. _Arbitration and Equitable Relief_.

(a) _Arbitration_. EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 11(b) BELOW, I AGREE THAT
ANY DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY ARISING OUT OF, RELATING TO, OR CONCERNING ANY
INTERPRETATION, CONSTRUCTION, PERFORMANCE OR BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT, SHALL
BE SETTLED BY ARBITRATION TO BE HELD IN RAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA, IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE EMPLOYMENT DISPUTE RESOLUTION RULES THEN IN EFFECT OF THE
AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION. THE ARBITRATOR MAY GRANT INJUNCTIONS OR
OTHER RELIEF IN SUCH DISPUTE OR CONTROVERSY. THE DECISION OF THE ARBITRATOR
SHALL BE FINAL, CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING ON THE PARTIES TO THE ARBITRATION.
JUDGMENT MAY BE ENTERED ON THE ARBITRATORS DECISION IN ANY COURT HAVING
JURISDICTION. THE COMPANY AND I SHALL EACH PAY ONE-HALF OF THE COSTS AND
EXPENSES OF SUCH ARBITRATION, AND EACH OF US SHALL SEPARATELY PAY OUR COUNSEL
FEES AND EXPENSES.



 

3 THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE CONSTITUTES A WAIVER OF EMPLOYEES RIGHT TO A JURY
TRIAL AND RELATES TO THE RESOLUTION OF ALL DISPUTES RELATING TO ALL ASPECTS
OF THE EMPLOYER/EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP (EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SECTION 10(b)

  EXHIBIT I

SHAREHOLDER CERTIFICATE

The undersigned is aware that pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of July _ _, 2006 (the " _Agreement_ "), entered
into by and among Secure Computing, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Secure_
"), Peach Acquisition Corp., a Georgia corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Secure (" _Sub_ "), and CipherTrust, Inc., a Georgia corporation
(the " _Company_ "), Sub will merge within and into the Company (the "
_Merger_ ") and all shares of the Companys Capital Stock will be exchanged
for the Merger Consideration. Unless otherwise indicated, capitalized terms
not defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

 

The undersigned understands that the execution of this Certificate is a
condition precedent to the undersigneds receipt of a portion of
Merger Consideration in the Merger (pursuant to the terms and conditions of
the Agreement).

The undersigned hereby represents and warrants to Secure as follows:

1\. _Investment Representations_.

(a) _Investment Purpose_. The undersigned is acquiring the shares of Secure
common stock that the undersigned will receive from Secure pursuant to the
Merger (the " _Secure Shares_ ") for the undersigneds own account, for
investment only and not with a view toward the resale or distribution thereof.

(b) _Residence of Shareholder_. The undersigned is a resident of the U.S.
state (or other jurisdiction) shown in the undersigneds address below and
will be the sole party in interest as to the Secure Shares.

(c) _Exemption from Registration_. The undersigned understands that he must
bear the economic risk of this investment for an indefinite period of time
because the Secure Shares are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _1933 Act_ "), or the securities laws of any U.S. state.
The undersigned has been advised that the issuance of the Secure Shares
pursuant to the Merger is not being registered under the 1933 Act on the basis
that such transaction is exempt from such registration requirements as a
transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering in reliance on
Regulation D, as promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("
_SEC_ ") pursuant to the 1933 Act, and that reliance by Secure on such
exemption is predicated in part on the undersigneds representations set forth
herein. The undersigned acknowledges that Secure makes no representations of
any kind concerning its intent or ability to offer or sell the Secure Shares
in a public offering or otherwise in the U.S.

(d) _Economic Risk_. The undersigned represents and warrants that he, she or
it is able to bear the economic risk of losing his, her or its entire
investment in Secure, which is not disproportionate to the undersigneds net worth, and
that the undersigned has adequate means of providing for the undersigneds
current needs and personal contingencies without regard to the investment in
Secure.

(e) _No Outside Representations and Warranties_. The undersigned represents
and warrants that in connection with his, her or its acquisition of the Secure
Shares no oral or written representations or warranties have been made to the
undersigned other than those as may be contained in the Agreement, the
Information Statement delivered herewith, or any documents filed by Secure
with the SEC. The undersigned acknowledges that no person is authorized to
give any information or to make any statement not contained n this
Certificate, the Agreement, the Information Statement or the documents filed
with the SEC, and that any information or statement not contained herein or
therein must not be relied upon as having been authorized by Secure, any
affiliates of Secure, or any professional advisors thereto.

(f) _Informed Investment Decision_. The undersigned represents and warrants
that, to the extent the undersigned has deemed necessary, the undersigned has
consulted with his, her or its attorney, financial advisors and others
regarding all financial, securities and tax aspects of the proposed
investment, and that said advisors have reviewed the Agreement, and all
documents relating thereto on the undersigneds behalf. The undersigned and
his, her or its advisors have sufficient knowledge and experience in business
and financial matters to evaluate Secure and the risks and merits of an
investment in Secure, to make an informed investment decision with respect
thereto, and to protect the undersigneds interest in connection with
the undersigneds subscription without need for the additional information
which would be required to be included in more complete registration
statements effective under the 1933 Act. The undersigned acknowledges that
neither Secure nor its affiliates nor any of their financial, securities, tax
or legal advisors have provided him, her or it with any advice or
recommendations with respect to the advantages, disadvantages or other aspects
of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

(g) _Access to Additional Information_. The undersigned acknowledges that the
undersigned and his, her or its advisors have had an opportunity to ask
questions of and to receive answers from the officers of Secure and to obtain
additional information in writing to the extent that Secure possesses such
information or could acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense: (i)
relative to Secure and the issuance of the Secure Shares in the Merger; and
(ii) necessary to verify the accuracy of any information, documents, books and
records furnished. All such materials and information requested by the
undersigned and his, her or its advisors (including information requested to
verify information previously furnished) have been made available and examined
by the undersigned or his, her or its advisors. (h) _Legend_. The undersigned agrees that stop-transfer instructions may be
placed upon the transfer records of Secure and that each certificate
representing the Secure Shares may be stamped or otherwise imprinted with a
legend in substantially the following form:

THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "1933 ACT"), OR UNDER THE
PROVISIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS, BUT HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY
THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF FOR PURPOSES OF INVESTMENT AND IN RELIANCE ON
STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE 1933 ACT, AND STATUTORY EXEMPTIONS UNDER
APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THESE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED,
TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED, EXCEPT IN A TRANSACTION WHICH IS EXEMPT FROM
REGISTRATION UNDER PROVISIONS OF THE 1933 ACT AND ANY APPLICABLE STATE
SECURITIES LAWS OR PURSUANT TO AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
THEREUNDER; AND IN THE CASE OF AN EXEMPTION ONLY IF THE CORPORATION HAS

LOCK-UP AGREEMENT

THIS LOCK-UP AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as of
_ _ 2006, by and among Secure Computing Corporation, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), CipherTrust, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the "
_Company_ "), and the undersigned shareholder of the Company (" _Holder_ ").
Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement (as defined below). 

_BACKGROUND_

A. Parent, the Company and Peach Acquisition Corp., a Georgia corporation and
wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), have entered into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as July 11, 2006 (the "
_Merger Agreement_ "), which provides for the merger of the Merger Sub with
and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to which the Company shall
become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

B. Holder has been advised that Holder may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of
Parent after the consummation of the Merger as the term "affiliate" is
defined in Rule 144 (" _Rule 144_ ") promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended (the " _1933 Act_ "), although nothing contained herein shall
be construed as an admission by Holder that Holder will in fact be an
"affiliate" of Parent after the consummation of the Merger.

C. As a condition and inducement to the willingness of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, Holder has agreed to enter
into this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound, the parties hereto agree as
follows:

1\. _Acknowledgments by Holder_. Holder has carefully read this Agreement and
the Merger Agreement and has had the opportunity to discuss the requirements
of this Agreement with Holders professional advisors, who Holder believes are
qualified to advise Holder with regard to such matters.

2\. _Lock-up_.

(a) Holder agrees, during the 180 day period beginning on the Closing Date
(the " _Lock-Up Period_ "), not to offer, contract to sell or otherwise sell,
dispose of, loan, pledge, grant any rights with respect to, make any
short sale of, grant any option for the purchase of, or enter into any
hedging or similar transaction with the same economic effect as a sale (each,
a " _Disposition_ ") of any shares of Parent Common Stock. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein, this Agreement shall not prohibit a transfer
of any shares of Parent Common Stock by Holder, (i) if such shares of Parent
Common Stock were acquired by the undersigned in the open market, (ii) to a
family member or trust, (iii) as a bona fide gift or gifts, (iv) as a
distribution to partners, members or stockholders of the undersigned, (v) pursuant to a sale
of 100% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock (including in
connection with a tender offer for such shares or by way of merger of Parent
with another Person), or (vi) to an affiliated Person under common control
with Holder; _provided_ , _however_ , that such transfers shall be permitted
only if, as a precondition to such transfer, the transferee agrees in writing
to be bound by all of the terms of this Section 2(a).

(b) Holder understands that there will be placed on the certificates for the
Parent Common Stock issued to Holder, or any substitutions therefor, a legend
stating in substance:

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE HELD BY AN "AFFILIATE" OF
SECURE COMPUTING CORPORATION AND MAY ONLY BE TRANSFERRED (1) IN ACCORDANCE
WITH RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND (2) IN

REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF, SECURE COMPUTING CORPORATION AND CIPHERTRUST, INC.,
A COPY OF WHICH AGREEMENT IS ON FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICES OF SECURE
COMPUTING CORPORATION."

It is understood and agreed that the legend contemplated in this Section 2(b)
shall be removed by delivery of a substitute certificate without such legend
if Holder shall have delivered to Parent a copy of a letter from the staff of
the Securities and Exchange Commission, or a written opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to Parent, to the effect that such legend is not
required for purposes of the 1933 Act; _provided_ , _however_ , it is further
understood and agreed that if the Lock-Up Period has expired and Holder is
not then an "affiliate" of Parent, Holder may request in writing that this
legend be removed, and Parent thereafter will reissue a substitute certificate
without this legend, without requiring the delivery of such a letter or
written opinion.

_(c)_ Immediately following the Closing Date, Parent and Company shall
mutually prepare, and Parent shall file, a Registration Statement on Form S-3
covering the resale of all of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued to
Holder pursuant to the Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions set
forth in the Merger Agreement.

3\. _Termination_.

the event of the termination of the Merger Agreement at any time prior to the
Closing Date.

4\. _Miscellaneous_.

or of any breach of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective unless
in writing and signed by each party hereto. In the event that any provision of
this Agreement, or the application of any such provision to any person, entity
or set of circumstances, shall be determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement, and the



 

-2- application of such provision to persons, entities or circumstances other than
those as to which it is determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or
unenforceable, shall not be impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue
to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

(b) _Binding Effect and Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but, except as
otherwise specifically provided herein, neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations of the parties hereto may be assigned by

Delaware.

(e) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding of
Holder, Parent and the Company relating to the subject matter hereof and
