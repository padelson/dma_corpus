Attn: Everett Willard Gray II

  


 

  

Dear Will:

  


 

  

The purpose of this letter ("Letter") is to confirm the intentions of the
parties hereto with respect to the acquisition by American Standard Energy
Corp. and/or a subsidiary, affiliate, designee or assign thereof
(collectively, "ASEC") of Cross Border Resources, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries
and affiliates (collectively "Cross Border"). The principal terms of the
transactions contemplated hereby (the "Transaction") would be as follows:

  

  

I. At the Closing (as hereinafter defined) of the Transaction, Cross Border
would merge with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASEC, with such
subsidiary remaining as the surviving company. ASEC, however, reserves the
right to alter the above structure of the Transaction (including, but not
limited to, an asset acquisition or stock purchase instead of a merger), if as
a result of its due diligence ASEC determines that an alternative structure is
preferable to ASEC.

  

  

II. The consideration for the Transaction shall be payable to the stockholders
of Cross Border in shares of common stock of ASEC (the "Shares"), the number
of which shall be determined within thirty (30) days from the date hereof
based on an agreed upon price for Cross Border and the relative Net Asset
Value of ASEC.

  

  

III. The Transaction would be subject to the execution and delivery by the
parties hereto of a mutually satisfactory merger agreement, containing
representations and warranties (which would survive the Closing), covenants,
indemnities and closing conditions of a type which are customarily included in
such agreements, including a break-up fee equal to 3% of the total merger
consideration to be paid if the Transaction does not close for reasons other
than a failure to satisfy a Condition Precedent (as defined in paragraph IV)
(the "Definitive Agreement"), to become effective upon signing of the
Definitive Agreement.

  

  

IV. The parties would use commercially reasonable efforts to adhere to a
schedule so that the Closing would occur on or about March 31, 2012, to be
extended as necessary if condition D set forth below has not yet been
satisfied. The Closing would be subject to, among other things (each, a
"Condition Precedent"):

  

  

A. the approval thereof by the Boards of Directors and a majority of the
stockholders of each of ASEC and Cross Border;

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

  

 

  

B. the receipt of all required third party (including lender approvals),
governmental, regulatory and administrative consents and approvals;

  

  

C. completion by ASEC and Cross Border to each of their satisfaction, of their
due diligence investigation set forth in this letter;

  

  

D. the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form S-4 registering the
Shares;

  

  

E. the absence of a material adverse change in the value of Cross Border or
ASEC since the date of the Definitive Agreement;

  

  

F. the absence of any injunction or other legal prohibition; and

  

  

G. a fairness opinion obtained by a nationally recognized firm on behalf of
each of ASEC and Cross Border.

  

  

V. Each party hereto hereby represents and warrants to the other party hereto
that it has done nothing to incur any obligation or liability to the other for
a finder's fee, commission, brokerage fee or like payment in connection with
the Transaction. Each party will indemnify the other against any claims,
costs, losses, expenses or liabilities arising from any claim for commissions,
finder's fees or other compensation in connection with the contemplated
Transaction which may be asserted by any person based on any agreement or
arrangement for payment.

  

  

VI. Each of the parties and their respective representatives shall be given
reasonable access upon prior notification (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) to those facilities, employees, books and exploration,
production, financial and legal records of the other party for the purpose of
conducting a "due diligence" investigation. Each party agrees to provide free
access to all of that party's field production facilities. The parties agree
to use their best efforts to complete their due diligence investigations by
December 31, 2011. All information which is obtained by the parties in
connection with the foregoing investigation shall be kept strictly
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement
between ASEC and Cross Border.

  

  

A. ASEC shall have the exclusive right to enter into the Transaction, and
Cross Border agrees that from the date of this Letter through June 30, 2012
(the "Exclusivity Period"), Cross Border shall not, nor shall the
stockholder(s) of Cross Border authorize or permit Cross Border's officers,
directors, employees, or any investment banker, financial adviser, attorney,
accountant, or other representative of Cross Border, to submit, solicit,
initiate, encourage, or discuss with third parties any proposal or offer from
any person relating to (i) any reorganization, dissolution, or
recapitalization of Cross Border, or merger or consolidation of Cross Border,
or (ii) sale of any stock of Cross Border, or (iii) sale of any assets of
Cross Border outside the ordinary course of business, or (iv) any other
transactions or business combinations involving Cross Border or its business
or assets including without limitation any debt or equity financing thereof
(as the case may be, an "Alternate Transaction" provided that the term
"Alternate Transaction" expressly excludes any debt financing obtained by
Cross Border for the purposes of replacing Cross Border's existing credit
facility with Texas Capital Bank and/or paying off Cross Border's outstanding
corporate debentures), or furnish information with respect to or assist or
participate in or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any
person to do or seek an Alternate Transaction. If a Definitive Agreement is
signed, the Exclusivity Period shall be extended until closing of the
Transaction or termination of the Definitive Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

  

 

  

B. Cross Border agrees that if it breaches it obligations in this paragraph VI
during the term of this Letter and closes an Alternate Transaction with a
third party within twelve (12) months after the termination thereof, Cross
Border will reimburse ASEC pursuant to Paragraph VII below. Cross Border
agrees to inform ASEC of any proposals, solicitations or discussions with any
third parties concerning a possible Alternate Transaction during the term of
this Letter.

  

  

VII. If the Transaction is not consummated due to Cross Border's breach of its
obligations under paragraph VI of this Letter, Cross Border shall promptly
reimburse ASEC for all due diligence costs and financing related costs
together with all expenses and out of pocket costs, including legal,
accounting and other professional fees incurred in connection with the
preparation, review, negotiation, execution, and delivery of this Letter and
the Definitive Agreement, and any other documents related to the Transaction
and the financing of the Transaction in an amount up to $200,000 (the
"Expenses"). It is understood that the reimbursement of Expenses and the legal
fees and expenses incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Letter
shall be the sole remedy available to ASEC hereunder. Other than as set forth
herein, neither party shall have any damage claim available to it based solely
upon a failure to enter into a Definitive Agreement.

  

  

VIII. Prior to closing, each party shall maintain and operate its oil and gas
properties in a good and workmanlike manner consistent with prudent and
generally accepted oil field practices. Other than in the ordinary course and
for fair market value, neither party shall sell, dispose or otherwise transfer
or encumber the properties, or its interest in them without written consent of
the other party. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prevent either party from
pledging or mortgaging its assets as security for bona fide debt. Each party
shall perform all lease obligations during this period in order to maintain
all leases.

  

  

IX. This Letter, and any obligations of the parties hereunder, other than
those set forth in paragraphs V-XI, may be terminated (i) by mutual consent of
the parties, (ii) by either party prior to December 31 if after completion of
its due diligence investigation it has determined not to proceed with the
Transaction, (iii) by ASEC if Cross Border has not (a) obtained approval of
the Transaction by its board of directors and (b) confirmed that Cross Border
is satisfied with its due diligence review of ASEC on or prior to December 31,
2011, or (iv) by either party in the event that a Definitive Agreement has not
been executed on or prior to January 31, 2012. Other than as set forth in
paragraph VII above, each of the parties shall bear their own respective
expenses incurred in connection with the Transaction.

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

  

 

  

X. The parties shall consult with each other prior to issuing any press
release or otherwise making any public statement with respect to the contents
of this document or the Transaction, and none of the parties hereto shall
issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable law.

  

  

XI. This letter of intent and any dispute arising therefrom shall be governed
by the laws of the state of New York. All proceedings (i.e. trial, arbitration
and mediation) with respect to any dispute resolution arising from this letter
of intent and the Definitive Agreement between the parties shall take place
within New York County, New York.

  

  

Except for the provisions of paragraphs V - XI (which are intended to be
binding agreements), this letter of intent does not, and is not intended to,
constitute a legally binding obligation on the part of any of the parties
hereto. It does, however, constitute a statement of the intention of said
parties to promptly proceed in good faith with respect to the Transaction. If
the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please so acknowledge
by signing the enclosed copy of this letter and returning it to the
undersigned.

Very truly yours,
