submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm by either Seller or Buyer for
review and resolution following a hearing by the Independent Accounting Firm

Representatives. The hearing date shall be scheduled by the Independent
Accounting Firm as soon as reasonably practicable and shall be conducted on a
confidential basis in the presence of each Party that wishes to attend and
such Party's Representatives and shall consist of one presentation by Seller
and one presentation by Buyer (to the extent that they attend). Seller and
Buyer shall, not later than seven (7) days prior to the hearing date set by

Certificate together with a proposed Closing Adjustment Certificate that
reflects such calculations prepared consistent with the methodologies required
for the preparation of the Closing Adjustment Certificate and the calculations
of the Closing Date Adjusted Net Indebtedness, the Closing Date Adjusted
Working Capital and the Closing Date Transaction Expenses pursuant to Section
2.4(b)) for settlement of any amounts set forth in the Notice of Disagreement
that remain in dispute. The Parties shall instruct the Independent Accounting
Firm to render a decision (which decision shall include a written statement of
findings and conclusions, including a written explanation of its reasoning
with respect to such findings and conclusions) resolving the matters in
dispute in accordance with this Section 2.4(d), and the Final Adjustment Certificate reflecting such
decision, within ten (10) Business Days after the conclusion of the hearing,
unless the Parties reach agreement prior thereto and withdraw the dispute from
arbitration. The Independent Accounting Firm shall (i) act as an arbitrator
and not as an expert, (ii) address only those items in dispute, and (iii) for
each item, not assign a value greater than the greatest value for such item
claimed by either Seller or Buyer or smaller than the smallest value for such
item claimed by either Seller or Buyer. The decision of the Independent
Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the Parties. The fees and
expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.4(d)
shall be borne by the Parties in inverse proportion to their respective
success on the merits and such allocation of fees and expenses shall be
calculated by the Independent Accounting Firm and shall be final and binding
on the Parties. For example, if Buyer's computation of the Adjustment Amount
set forth on the Closing Adjustment Certificate is different from the
Adjustment Amount set forth on the Final Adjustment Certificate as adjusted by
the Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.4(d) by ten percent
(10%), and Seller's computation of the Adjustment Amount set forth on the
Notice of Disagreement is different from the Adjustment Amount set forth on
the Final Adjustment Certificate by five percent (5%), then two-thirds of the
fees and expenses relating to the appointment of the Independent Accounting
Firm and the work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accounting Firm
will be paid by Buyer and one-third of such fees and expenses shall be paid by
Seller. As used in this Agreement, the term "Final Adjustment Certificate"
shall mean the Closing Adjustment Certificate delivered (or deemed delivered)
pursuant to Section 2.4(b), as subsequently adjusted, if applicable, pursuant
to this Section 2.4(d) to reflect any subsequent written agreement between the

Firm, any amendments or modifications to the Closing Adjustment Certificate

Schedule C.

ten (10) Business Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of

Business Days after the Final Settlement Date by wire transfer of immediately

payable to but excluding the date of payment at a rate per annum (accruing
daily and computed on the basis of a year of three hundred sixty (360) days
and the actual number of days elapsed) equal to two percent (2%) per annum. Such interest shall be payable at the same time as the
payment to which it relates.

Section 6.7 Tax Matters.

(a) Buyer shall cause each Company Entity to prepare and file (or cause to be
prepared and filed) all Tax Returns of such Company Entity for (i) any Tax
period ending on or before the Closing Date and required to be filed after the Closing Date (a
"Pre-Closing Return"), and (ii) any Straddle Period (a "Straddle Period
Return"), in each case, in accordance with applicable Law and the Governing
Documents of such Company Entity and consistent with the past practices of
such Company Entity. Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft of each such Pre-
Closing Return or Straddle Period Return at least thirty (30) days prior to
the due date thereof for Seller's review, comment and approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably delayed, conditioned or withheld, and Buyer shall
incorporate Seller's comments. In the case of any Company Entity, Seller shall
be entitled to exercise all rights (and shall be subject to any obligations)
of Buyer (or any Affiliates (including the Company Entities following the
Closing) or Representative thereof) with respect to the review, approval and
filing of any Pre-Closing Return or Straddle Period Return of such Company
Entity. The preparation and filing of any Tax Return of the Company that does
not relate to a Tax Return of a Company Entity for any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date or Straddle Period Return shall be exclusively within
the control of Buyer. Seller shall pay either to Buyer or to the relevant
Company Entity, on or before five (5) days prior to the due date, any amount
due and payable on (i) any Pre-Closing Return, and (ii) any Straddle Period
Return to the extent such amount is apportioned to the Seller (as determined
pursuant to Section 6.7(d)), in each case to the extent not accounted for in
the determination of the Preliminary Purchase Price or the Final Purchase
Price (or any component thereof).

(b) After the Closing Date, neither Buyer, nor any of its Affiliates
(including any Company Entity), nor any Representatives thereof, shall,
without Seller's consent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed, (i) amend or approve or consent to the amendment of any Pre-
Closing Return, Straddle Period Return or other Tax Return of the Company
Entities with respect to a taxable period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date, (ii) make, change, approve or consent to any Tax election with respect
to any Company Entity, or take or fail to take any action with respect to any
such entity (including transfers of assets of or interests in legal entities,
payments of dividends, or redemptions of stock), in each case, that reasonably
would be expected to increase the Taxes of Seller or its Affiliates or
beneficial owners for any Tax period ending on or prior to August 31, 2019,or
(iii) agree or consent to the amendment of any Governing Document, or the
waiver of any right or obligation of any Company Entity under, any Governing
Document of, any Company Entity that reasonably would be expected to impair or
adversely affect the right of Seller hereunder to exercise the rights of Buyer
(or its Affiliate (including the Company Entities following the Closing) or
any Representative thereof) as provided in clauses (a) or (c).

(c) Seller and Buyer shall notify the other within ten (10) days of the
receipt by Seller or Buyer (or any of their Affiliates), as applicable, of
notice of any inquiries, claims, assessments, audits or similar events with
respect to Taxes of or with respect to any Company Entity for which Seller (or
any of its Affiliates) may be liable pursuant to this Agreement, directly on a
pass-through basis (such as income Taxes) or otherwise (a "Tax Proceeding");
provided, that no failure or delay in providing notice of a Tax Proceeding
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party
under this Agreement, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced thereby. In the case of any Tax Proceeding with respect to a
Company Entity, Seller and/or the Persons so appointed by Seller shall each be
entitled to exercise all rights (and shall be subject to any obligations) of
Buyer (or any Affiliate (including the Company Entities following the Closing)
or Representative thereof) hereunder or pursuant to the Governing Documents of
the applicable Company Entity, with respect to the control and defense of such
Tax Proceeding, including the right to act as tax matters partner or
partnership representative. Seller shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of the
developments and status of any Tax Proceeding controlled by Seller and shall
not settle or compromise any such Tax Proceeding without Buyer's consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, that such consent
shall not be required if (i) the settlement agreement contains a complete and
unconditional release of the defendant under the Tax Proceeding, and (ii) the
settlement is for money damages only. If Seller does not elect to control the
resolution of a Tax Proceeding, Buyer shall (A) permit Seller to participate
(at its own expense) in such Tax Proceeding, (B) keep Seller reasonably
informed of developments and the status of such Tax Proceeding, and (C) not
settle or compromise such Tax Proceeding without the prior written consent of
Seller. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this clause (c)
and Section 8.3 (to the extent applicable), this clause (c) shall control.

(d) At Seller's request, the Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Company
Entity following the Closing) shall apply for any Tax refund available for any
Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date. Seller
shall be entitled to an amount equal to the product of (i) the relevant
Applicable Percentage, and (ii) any Tax refunds or credits received by or
credited to Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Company Entity following
the Closing) with respect to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or
before the Closing Date, to the extent that such amount is not reflected as
current assets in the calculation of Closing Date Adjusted Working Capital
(collectively, "Tax Refunds"). Buyer shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Seller
the amount of Seller's share of any Tax Refund (plus any interest actually
received with respect thereto from an applicable Governmental Authority), net
of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred in
connection with receiving such Tax Refund, within ten (10) days of receipt of
or entitlement to such Tax Refund. With respect to any Straddle Period, the
Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Company Entity following the Closing)
shall pay to Seller, within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date, an amount (to
the extent that such amount is not reflected as current assets in the
calculation of Closing Date Adjusted Working Capital) equal to the product of
(i) the relevant Applicable Percentage, and (ii) the excess of (1) any
estimated Tax payments made by the Seller or its Affiliates (including any
Company Entity prior to Closing) for the taxable period that includes the
Closing Date, over (2) the Tax liability for such taxable year (with respect
to Taxes for which estimated Tax payments were made) as if such taxable year
ended on the Closing Date. For purposes of Section 6.7(a) and this Section
6.7(d), all Taxes and Tax liabilities with respect to the income, property or
operations of the Company Entities that relate to the Straddle Period shall be
apportioned between Seller and Buyer as follows: (i) in the case of Taxes
other than income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, on a per-diem basis,
and (ii) in the case of income, sales and use and withholding Taxes, as
determined from the books and records of the Company Entities as though the
taxable year of the Company Entities terminated at the close of business on
the Closing Date.

(e) Any Tax-sharing, Tax allocation or Tax reimbursement agreement between
Sempra Energy or its Affiliates, on the one hand, and any Company Entity, on
the other hand, shall be terminated as of the Closing Date.

(f) Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
provide to the other Party such cooperation and information, as and to the
extent reasonably requested and reasonably necessary, in connection with (i)
preparing, reviewing or filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or claim for
refund of or with respect to the Company Entities, (ii) determining
Liabilities for Taxes or a right to refund of Taxes of or with respect to the
Company Entities, or (iii) conducting any audit or other action with respect
to Taxes of or with respect to the Company Entities.

(g) With respect to any capital gains Taxes that the Seller is required to pay
to SUNAT in connection with the transaction contemplated hereunder, the Seller
shall (i) timely pay to SUNAT the full amount of such capital gains Taxes,
which equals to thirty percent (30%) of the amount of capital gains realized by the Seller as a result of the transaction
contemplated under this Agreement, within the timeframe required by applicable
Law; and (ii) provide the Buyer with a copy of the payment receipt issued by
SUNAT evidencing the full payment of the capital gains Taxes within ten (10)

Section 8.2 Indemnification.

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, after the Closing,
Seller shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i)
any breach of any representations and warranties made by Seller in Articles
III and IV of this Agreement as if such representations and warranties were
made on the date hereof and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent any
such representation or warranty, by its terms, speaks as of a specified date,
in which case, as if such representation or warranty was made as of such
specified date), (ii) any breach, nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any
covenant on the part of Seller contained in this Agreement, and (iii) to the
extent not otherwise covered in this Section 8.2(a), any Taxes imposed on any
Company Entity with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period; provided, that Seller
shall not be liable for, and shall not indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties
for, any Taxes that were taken into account in the calculation of the
Preliminary Purchase Price or the Final Purchase Price.

(b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, after the Closing,
Buyer shall indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold
each of them harmless from and against, any and all Damages suffered, incurred
or sustained by any of them resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i)
any breach of any representations and warranties made by Buyer as if such
representations and warranties were made on the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date (except to the extent any such representation or warranty, by its
terms, speaks as of a specified date, in which case, as if such representation
or warranty was made as of such specified date), and (ii) any breach,
nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant on the part of Buyer
contained in this Agreement.

(c) Seller shall not be liable for, and no amounts of indemnity shall be
payable in the case of, any claims by a Buyer Indemnified Party for breaches
by Seller of representations and warranties, other than the Fundamental
Representations and Tax Representations, unless and until the aggregate
indemnifiable Damages for which Seller would be liable hereunder for breaches
by Seller of representations and warranties (excluding the Fundamental
Representations and Tax Representations) (after giving effect to any Indemnity
Reduction Amounts) equals or exceeds an amount equal to one percent (1%) of
the Base Purchase Price in the aggregate (the "Deductible"), in which event Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to claim indemnity for Damages only to
the extent such aggregate Damages exceed the Deductible and for such amount in
excess.

(d) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller shall not be
liable, with respect to any individual claim (or a series of related claims)
hereunder for breaches by Seller of representations and warranties (other than
the Fundamental Representations and Tax Representations) that results in
otherwise indemnifiable Damages, and such Damages (relating to any individual
claim or a series of related claims) shall not be counted toward satisfaction
of the Deductible, unless such Damages exceed an amount equal to two hundred
and fifty thousand dollars ($250,000).

(e) Seller's Liability for indemnification of Damages under this Agreement
resulting from, arising out of, or relating to any breach or failure of any
representation or warranty made by Seller (other than Fundamental
Representations and Tax Representations) shall be limited to, in the
aggregate, an amount equal to seven point five percent (7.5%) of the Base
Purchase Price (the "Cap"); provided, that under no circumstances shall the
maximum aggregate amount of indemnifiable Damages which may be recovered by
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for indemnification pursuant to this Article
VIII be greater than the Final Purchase Price.

(f) The amount which an Indemnifying Party is or may be required to pay to an
Indemnified Party in respect of Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement shall be reduced by any amounts under insurance policies,
indemnity, contribution or similar payment actually received (net of costs of
enforcement or recovery, deductibles, retro-premium adjustments and other
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in
obtaining such proceeds or reimbursements) by or on behalf of any Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates from third parties and any Tax benefit (realized in
the same fiscal year in which the Damages are incurred) to the Indemnified
Party or its Affiliates arising in connection with the payment of any such
Damages (such amounts and benefits (net of costs of enforcement or recovery,
deductibles, retro-premium adjustments and other expenses reasonably incurred
by such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in obtaining such proceeds or
reimbursements) are collectively referred to herein as "Indemnity Reduction
Amounts"). If any Indemnified Party or its Affiliates receives any Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect of a claim for which indemnification is provided
under this Agreement after the full amount of such claim has been paid by an
Indemnifying Party or after an Indemnifying Party has made a partial payment
of such claim and such Indemnity Reduction Amounts exceed the remaining unpaid
balance of such claim, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly remit to the
Indemnifying Party an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the amount
theretofore paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such claim, less (ii)
the amount of the indemnity payment that would have been due if such Indemnity
Reduction Amounts in respect thereof had been received before the indemnity
payment was made. Except in the case of fraud, an insurer or other third party
who would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the
responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of the
indemnification provisions hereof, have any subrogation rights with respect
thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other
third party shall be entitled to any benefit they would not be entitled to
receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions by virtue of the
indemnification provisions hereof. Each of Seller and Buyer, as appropriate,
shall, or shall cause each Indemnified Party to, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue promptly any claims or rights it may have against all third parties which would reduce the amount of Damages for which
indemnification is provided under this Agreement and take all commercially
reasonable actions to mitigate damages; provided the foregoing shall not
require any Indemnified Party to commence or threaten to commence any Action.

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification obligations of the Parties
hereunder shall include the obligation to pay Damages relating to breaches
which do not arise out of, or involve, any Third-Party Claims.

(h) The amount of indemnifiable Damages in respect of any breach of or
inaccuracy in a representation or warranty (other than the representations and
warranties in Section 3.8(c) and the phrase "in all material respects" with
respect to the fair presentation of the Financial Statements in accordance
with IFRS in Section 3.6), shall be determined as if such representation and
warranty had not contained any limitation or qualification as to materiality,
material adverse change, Material Adverse Effect or similar language;
provided, that the foregoing shall not apply for the purposes of determining
whether a breach or inaccuracy in a representation or warranty in this
Agreement has occurred.

Section 8.3 Method of Asserting Claims. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under Section 8.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) In the event any Action in respect of which an Indemnified Party might
seek indemnity under Section 8.2 is commenced against or sought to be
collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than a Party or any of
its Affiliates (other than a claim for Taxes) (a "Third-Party Claim"), then
such Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice reasonably promptly to the
Indemnifying Party in accordance with clause (b) below. In case any such
Action is brought against an Indemnified Party, the Indemnifying Party shall
be entitled to participate in and to assume and control the defense thereof,
at the Indemnifying Party's expense, with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
such Indemnified Party, if it gives notice of its intent to do so to Buyer and
such Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Claim
Notice, and then the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such
Indemnified Party for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
latter in connection with the defense thereof; provided, that the Indemnifying
Party shall use diligent and good faith efforts in such defense and shall keep
the Indemnified Party reasonably apprised of the status thereof, and the
Indemnified Party may participate without obstruction in such defense at the
Indemnified Party's expense; provided further that if the Indemnifying Party
is Seller, such Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to defend or
assume the defense of any such Third-Party Claim (x) which is a criminal
proceeding, (y) in which the principal relief sought against the Indemnified
Party is other than monetary damages or (z) for which the amount claimed as
Damages is double the maximum aggregate amount of Damages for which the
Indemnifying Person is liable under this Article VIII. If the Indemnifying
Party does not elect or is not entitled to assume the defense of a Third-Party
Claim, it shall not be obligated to pay the reasonable and documented fees and
expenses of more than one counsel for the Indemnified Parties with respect to
such Third-Party Claim. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Indemnifying
Party has elected and is entitled to assume or continue the defense of a
Third-Party Claim in accordance with this Section 8.3(a), an Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Party's
expense to participate in the defense of a Third-Party Claim if the named
parties to any such claim (including any impleaded parties) include both such
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party shall
have been advised by outside counsel that there is an actual conflict of interest between the Indemnifying
Party and Indemnified Party that would make it inappropriate in the reasonable
judgment of such counsel for the same counsel to represent both the
Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party; provided, that (i) the
Indemnified Party shall use diligent and good faith efforts in such defense
and (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any such Third-
Party Claim, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate
counsel at any time for the Indemnified Party, except to the extent that local
or regulatory counsel, in addition to its regular counsel, is required in
order to effectively defend against such Third-Party Claim. No Indemnifying
Party shall consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement of
any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed; provided, that such consent shall not be required if (i) the
settlement agreement contains a complete and unconditional general release by
the third party asserting the claim of all Indemnified Parties affected by the
claim from all Liability arising out of such claim, and (ii) the settlement is
for money damages only and does not involve any finding or admission of any
violation of Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume control or is not entitled to continue
control over the defense of such Third-Party Claim as provided in this Section
8.3(a), then the Indemnified Party shall have the right to defend, resolve,
settle or compromise such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense (or,
if the matter in question is one for which the Indemnified Party is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party); provided, that (A) the Indemnified Party shall use
diligent, reasonable and good faith efforts in its defense of such Third-Party
Claim, (B) the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any such
Third-Party Claim, be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one
separate counsel at any time for the Indemnified Party, except to the extent
that local or regulatory counsel, in addition to its regular counsel, is
required in order to effectively defend against such Third-Party Claim, (C)
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in the defense of
such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense, but the Indemnified Party
shall control such defense and (D) the Indemnifying Party shall not be
obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party hereunder for any settlement
entered into or any judgment that was consented to without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnified Party shall not settle any
Third-Party Claim for which it is pursuing a claim for Damages under this
Article VIII without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) or unless a
final Governmental Order from which no appeal may be taken has been entered
against the Indemnified Party for such Third-Party Claim.

(b) In the event of any claim or demand, including Third-Party Claims, in
respect of which an Indemnified Party might seek indemnity hereunder, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver an Indemnity Notice promptly to the
Indemnifying Party; provided, that the failure by any Indemnified Party to
give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair such party's rights hereunder
except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced
thereby, and then only to the extent of such prejudice. The Indemnifying Party
shall notify the Indemnified Party within the thirty (30)-day period after its
receipt of such Indemnity Notice (the "Dispute Period") as to whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its Liability to the Indemnified Party hereunder.

(c) The Parties shall cooperate with one another with respect to resolving any
claim or Liability with respect to which one Party is obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder including making available to the other Party all witnesses under
such Party's control relating thereto as is reasonably required by the other
Party and providing, or causing their respective employees to provide, the
other Party with full access to any of the personnel, property and facilities
and such books and records and other materials and information as is necessary
to allow the applicable Party to defend and resolve, settle or compromise any
Third-Party Claims.

(d) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, any amounts payable
pursuant to the indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall be paid
without duplication, including with respect to duplication of the amount of
any Liability to the extent the amount of such Liability is included in the
Closing Adjustment Certificate or with respect to the amount of any Liability
for which there is an accrual or reserve contained in the Financial
Statements.

Persons shall be entitled to recover any of their or their Affiliates'
Indirect Losses resulting from, arising out of or relating to (i) a breach by

accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

remedies set forth in this Article VIII shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to any and all claims relating, directly or indirectly, to the
subject matter of this Agreement (other than claims arising from fraud on the part of a Party). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing and subject to Section 10.12, this
Article VIII and Article IX, effective as of the Closing, each Party hereby
waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all

matter of this Agreement, whether arising under or based upon any Law, other

declared by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void

Transaction, whether or not the Transaction is consummated.

Section 10.11 No Recourse Against Non-Recourse Persons. All claims,
obligations, Liabilities, or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort,
in equity or at Law, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate in any
manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of
this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), shall be made only
against (and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified
as Parties in the preamble to this Agreement (the "Contracting Parties"). No
Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any past, present or future
Representative, incorporator, equityholder or Affiliate of such Contracting
Party or any past, present or future Representative, incorporator,
equityholder or Affiliate of any of the foregoing (the "Non-Recourse
Persons"), shall have any Liability (whether in contract or in tort, in equity
or at Law, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action,
obligations, or Liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or
related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by
reason of this Agreement or in its negotiation, execution, performance, or
breach; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such Liabilities, claims,
causes of action and obligations against any such Non-Recourse Persons.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available in equity or at Law, or granted by statute, to avoid or
disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or otherwise impose Liability
of a Contracting Party on any Non-Recourse Persons, whether granted by statute
or based on theories of equity, agency, control, instrumentality, alter ego,
domination, sham, single business enterprise, piercing the veil, unfairness,
undercapitalization, or otherwise, and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Non-Recourse Persons with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement. Section 10.12 Specific Performance. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, (a) each Party recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by
it of any covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement shall cause the
other Party to sustain irreparable harm for which it would not have an
adequate remedy at Law, and therefore in the event of any such breach the
aggrieved Party shall, without the posting of bond or other security (any
requirement for which the Parties hereby waive), be entitled to the remedy of
specific performance of such covenants and agreements, including injunctive
and other equitable relief, in addition to any other remedy to which it might
be entitled, (b) a Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement, and (c) in the event that any action is
brought in equity to enforce the provisions of this Agreement, no Party shall
allege, and each Party hereby waives the defense or counterclaim, that there
is an adequate remedy at law. The Parties further agree that (i) by seeking
the remedies provided for in this Section 10.12, a Party shall not in any
respect waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available
to a Party under this Agreement, including monetary damages or in the event
that the remedies provided for in this Section 10.12 are not available or
otherwise are not granted and (ii) nothing contained in this Section 10.12
shall require any Party to institute any proceeding for (or limit any Party's
right to institute any proceeding for) specific performance under this Section
10.12 before exercising any termination right under Section 9.1 (and pursuing
damages after such termination) nor shall the commencement of any action
pursuant to this Section 10.12 or anything contained in this Section 10.12
restrict or limit any Party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of Section 9.1 or pursue any other remedies under this
Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

Section 10.13 Legal Representation.

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Company Entities and
Seller have retained (i) White and Case LLP, (ii) Rodrigo, Elias and Medrano, and
(iii) the legal departments of Seller and its Affiliates (collectively,
"Seller's Counsel") to act as their counsel in connection with the Transaction
and that Seller's Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Party in
connection with the Transaction and that none of the other Parties has the
status of a client of any of Seller's Counsel for conflict of interest or any
other purposes as a result thereof. Seller and Buyer hereby agree that, in the
event that any dispute, or any other matter in which the interests of Seller
and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Buyer and its Affiliates (including
the Company Entities), on the other hand, are adverse, arises after the
Closing between Buyer or the Company Entities, on the one hand, and Seller and
its Affiliates, on the other hand, Seller's Counsel may represent any or all
of Seller and its Affiliates in such dispute even though the interests of
Seller and its Affiliates may be directly adverse to Buyer or the Company
Entities, and even though Seller's Counsel formerly may have represented the
Company Entities in any matter substantially related to such dispute.

(b) Seller and its Affiliates and Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Company Entities following the Closing with respect to Buyer) acknowledge and
agree that, in connection with any future disputes, lawsuits, actions,
proceedings, investigations or other matters, including any dispute between
Buyer, the Company Entities or any of its or their respective Affiliates, on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, or with
or between any other Persons, with respect to the Transaction or otherwise,
(i) as to all communications among Seller's Counsel, the Company Entities,
Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the preparation, analysis,
sale process, negotiation, documentation and/or consummation of the Transaction and any similar or related actions, the
attorney-client privilege, attorney work product protection and the
expectation of client confidence belongs solely to Seller or its Affiliates
(other than the Company Entities), and may be controlled by Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Company Entities), and shall not pass to or be
claimed by Buyer, the Company Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates,
and (ii) Seller's Counsel may disclose to Seller or its Affiliates any
information learned by Seller's Counsel in the course of its representation of
Seller, the Company Entities or their respective Affiliates in connection with
the preparation, analysis, sale process, negotiation, documentation and/or
consummation of the Transaction and any similar or related actions, whether or
not such information is subject to attorney-client privilege, attorney work
product protection, or Seller's Counsel's duty of confidentiality.
Accordingly, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Buyer and its
Affiliates shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files
of Seller's Counsel, whether or not the Closing occurs. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) to the extent
that files of Seller's Counsel constitute property of the client, only Seller
and its Affiliates shall hold such property rights, and (i) Seller's Counsel
shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client
communications or files to Buyer or the Company Entities by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Seller's Counsel and the Company Entities
or otherwise in connection with the preparation, analysis, sale process,
negotiation, documentation and/or consummation of the Transaction and any
similar or related actions.

(c) If and to the extent that, at any time subsequent to Closing, Buyer or any
of its Affiliates (including the Company Entities) shall have the right to
assert or waive any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication between the Company Entities or its Affiliates and any Person
representing them that occurred at any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on
behalf of itself and its Affiliates (including the Company Entities), shall be
entitled to waive such privilege only with the consent of Seller.

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS
OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THE STATE OR FEDERAL
COURTS LOCATED WITHIN NEW YORK COUNTY IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL HAVE

Section 10.18 Currency Matters.

(a) All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. Each Party's obligations
hereunder to make payments in Dollars shall not be discharged or satisfied by
any tender or recovery pursuant to any judgment expressed in, or converted
into, any currency other than Dollars, except to the extent that such tender
or recovery results in the effective receipt by the respective party of the
full amount of Dollars expressed to be payable to such party under this
Agreement.

(b) Except as expressly set forth herein, in all cases where it is necessary
for the determination of any amount included in the calculation of the
Preliminary Purchase Price or the Final Purchase Price to determine or specify
an amount in Dollars where the underlying value of such amount is expressed in
a currency other than Dollars, such value shall be converted into Dollars at
the Exchange Rate.

Section 10.19 Disclosure Schedules. There may be included in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule items and information, the disclosure of which is not
required either in response to an express disclosure requirement contained in a provision hereof
or as an exception to one or more representations or warranties contained in
Article III or Article IV or to one or more covenants contained in Article VI.
Inclusion of any items or information in the Seller Disclosure Schedule shall
not be deemed to be an acknowledgment or agreement that any such item or
information (or any non-disclosed item or information of comparable or greater
significance) is "material" or is reasonably likely to result in a Material
Adverse Effect or to affect the interpretation of such term for purposes of
this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules set forth items of disclosure with
specific reference to the particular Section and/or subsection of this
Agreement to which the items or information in such Disclosure Schedules
relates; provided, that any information set forth in one section or subsection
pertaining to the representations, warranties and covenants of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be,
shall be deemed to apply to each other section or subsection thereof
pertaining to representations, warranties and covenants to the extent that it
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that it is relevant to
such other sections or subsections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the
Buyer Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be. Nothing in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an admission of any liability or
obligation of any Party to any third party, nor an admission to any third
party against the interests of any or all of the Parties.
