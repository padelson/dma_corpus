of the Seller under this Agreement (a "Third Party Claim"), the Purchaser
shall notify the Seller of such Third Party Claim as soon as reasonably
practicable after having become aware thereof in accordance with Articles 12.1
and 12.2. As soon as possible following the date of that notification, the

soon as reasonably practicable after having become aware thereof in accordance
with Articles 12.1 and 12.2. As soon as possible following the date of that

be taken. The Seller shall be entitled to take, or require the Purchaser to
take, or to procure that the relevant Group Company shall take, any action
reasonably necessary to defend or settle the Tax Claim. To the extent that any
such Tax Claim could reasonably have an adverse Tax effect on the Purchaser or
the Purchaser's Group, then the Seller will inform the Purchaser periodically
of relevant developments and obtain the Purchaser\'s prior written approval
(such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) on critical
decisions or settlement and on material written communication to be forwarded
to any Tax Authority or competent court in relation to the Tax Claim.
