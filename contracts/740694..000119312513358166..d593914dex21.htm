By and Among

ATLAS MANAGEMENT, INC.,

 

DUBLIN ACQUISITION SUB INC.,

and 

KAYDON CORPORATION

Dated as of September 5, 2013

The Merger Agreement has been provided solely to inform investors of its
terms. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties
and covenants, which were made for the purposes of such agreement and as of
specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger
Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather as a way
of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be
inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may be
subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company,
Parent and Acquisition Sub in connection with the negotiated terms or with
certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement, may not
be accurate or complete as of any specified date or may be subject to a
contractual standard of materiality different from those generally applicable
to stockholders or other investors in the Company. The Companys stockholders
and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger
Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and
covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state
of facts or conditions of the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their
respective subsidiaries or affiliates. TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE OFFER AND THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) On the date that is ten (10) days after the date of execution of this
Agreement by all parties hereto, or as promptly as reasonably practicable
thereafter, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition Sub to,
commence, within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act,

day on which the Go-Shop Period expires and (ii) the date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule
14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act). Acquisition Sub expressly
reserves the right to waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or
modify the terms of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the
consent of the Company, Acquisition Sub shall not, and Parent shall not
permit Acquisition Sub to, (i) reduce the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer Price, (iii) amend, modify
or waive the Minimum Tender Condition, (iv) add to the Offer Conditions or,

this Agreement to the contrary, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Acquisition Sub to, (i) extend the Offer on one or more occasions, in
consecutive increments of up to five (5) Business Days (or such longer period
as the parties hereto may agree) each, if, at any then-scheduled expiration
of the Offer, any Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition)
shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such time as each such
condition shall have been satisfied or waived, and (ii) extend the Offer for
the minimum period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the SEC or the staff thereof or of the NYSE applicable to the
Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that Acquisition Sub shall not be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any then-scheduled
expiration of the Offer, each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the Minimum Tender
Condition shall not have been satisfied, then Acquisition Sub may and, if
requested by the Company, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause

_provided_ , _however_ , that the maximum number of days that the Offer may be
extended pursuant to this sentence shall be twenty (20) Business Days unless

Acquisition Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the
Termination Date. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer
and this Agreement, Acquisition Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Acquisition
Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock
that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant

 



\- 2 -  to the Offer promptly after the applicable expiration date of the Offer (as
it may be extended in accordance with this _Section 1.1(a)_). Payment for
shares of Company Common Stock by Acquisition Sub pursuant to and subject to
the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer
Closing". The Offer may not be terminated prior to its expiration date (as
such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this
_Section 1.1(a)_), unless this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance
with _Section 7.1_. If (i) at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer, (x)
each Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have
been satisfied or waived, (y) the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been
satisfied and (z) no further extensions or re-extensions of the Offer are
permitted or required pursuant to this _Section 1.1_ or (ii) this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 7.1_, then, in each case, Acquisition Sub
shall promptly (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. The
termination of the Offer pursuant to clause (i) of the immediately preceding
sentence is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Termination", and the
date on which such Offer Termination occurs is referred to in this Agreement
as the "Offer Termination Date". If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by
Acquisition Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Section
7.1_, Acquisition Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause any depository

Common Stock to the registered holders thereof.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"), which shall include, as exhibits, an offer to purchase and a
related letter of transmittal, a summary advertisement and other ancillary
Offer documents pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and
the documents attached as exhibits thereto, together with any amendments or
supplements thereto, the "Offer Documents"). Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
cause the Offer Documents to comply as to form in all material respects with
the Exchange Act, the applicable rules and regulations of the New York Stock
Exchange and all other applicable Laws. The Company shall promptly furnish to
Parent and Acquisition Sub all information concerning the Company that is
required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of
Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and each of Parent and Acquisition Sub shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to cause the Offer
Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the Companys stockholders, in each case as and to the extent
required by applicable federal securities Laws. Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall promptly notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Offer
Documents, and shall provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
between Parent, Acquisition Sub and their respective Representatives, on the
one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Parent and Acquisition Sub shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents.
Prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (or any amendment or supplement
thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the Company, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, Parent and
Acquisition Sub shall provide the Company a reasonable opportunity to review
and to propose comments on such document or response.

 

(c) Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided, to Acquisition Sub on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock that Acquisition Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if at any
Offer expiration, all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or, to the extent
permitted by this Agreement, waived, Acquisition Sub may not extend the Offer
and shall promptly accept for payment and pay for shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer.

all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to the
holders of Company Common Stock. The Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9
to comply as to form in all material respects with the Exchange Act, the
applicable rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange and all other
applicable Laws. The Company and Parent shall cooperate to cause the Schedule
14D-9 to be mailed or otherwise disseminated together with the Offer Documents

promptly furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent
and Acquisition Sub that is required by the Exchange Act to be set forth in
the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9,
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule
14D-9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws. The Company shall
promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
any request from the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Schedule 14D-9,
and shall provide Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company
and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. The
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as
reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule
14D-9. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the dissemination thereof to the stockholders of the
Company, or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose
comments such document or response. Unless an Adverse Recommendation Change

directors of the Company contained in the Schedule 14D-9.

 

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to promptly (and in any event within five (5) Business Days

lists, listings and files, in each case as required by the Confidentiality
Agreement, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and
the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request,
deliver to the Company or destroy all copies of such information then in
their possession or control in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.
In addition, in connection with the Offer, the Company shall cooperate with
Parent and Acquisition Sub to disseminate the Offer Documents to holders of

determine that the Merger is ineligible to be effected pursuant to Section
251(h) of the DGCL (the "251(h) Inapplicable Determination"), the Merger shall
be effected in accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL. If prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company make a 251(h) Inapplicable
Determination then, contingent and effective upon the occurrence of the 251(h)
Inapplicable Determination and the Offer Closing, the Company hereby grants to
Acquisition Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up Option"), exercisable only
on the terms and conditions set forth in this _Section 1.3_, to purchase at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price that number of newly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option
Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock directly or
indirectly owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub at the time of the Top-Up
Closing (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), shall constitute ninety
percent (90%) of the shares of Company Common Stock that are then issued and
outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Top-Up Option may not be exercised to the
extent that the number of Top-Up Option Shares exceeds that number of shares
of Company Common Stock authorized and unissued (treating shares owned by the
Company as treasury stock as unissued) and not reserved for issuance at the
time of exercise of the Top-Up Option. The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable
only once, in whole but not in part. The obligation of the Company to issue
and deliver the Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up Option
is subject to the condition that no applicable Law shall be in effect that has
the effect of enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance and delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares.

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercised by Acquisition Sub from and after the
Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (1) the Effective Time and
(2) the valid termination of this Agreement. The Top-Up Option may be
exercised by Acquisition Sub, if: (i) the 251(h) Inapplicable Determination
has been made; (ii) all of the Conditions to the Offer have been satisfied or
(to the extent permitted) waived; (iii) at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and
Acquisition Sub immediately following the Offer Closing does not constitute
at least ninety percent (90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that are then issued and outstanding; (iv) the exercise of the Top-Up Option
would result in Parent or Acquisition Sub owning at least ninety percent
(90%) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that are then issued and
outstanding upon exercise of the Top-Up Option; and (v) the exercise of the
Top-Up Option in accordance with this  _Section 1.3_ would not violate any
applicable Laws. The Top-Up Option shall not be exercised if Acquisition Sub
has not accepted for payment all shares of Company Common Stock validly
tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn. To exercise such Top-Up Option, (i)
Parent shall give the Company written notice specifying the number of shares
of Company Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent and its
subsidiaries at the time of such notice (after giving effect to the Offer
Closing) and the manner in which payment for the Top-Up Option Shares shall be
paid (ii) the Company shall, promptly following receipt of such notice,
deliver written notice to Acquisition Sub specifying, based on the information
provided by Parent in its notice, the number of Top-Up Option Shares to be
purchased. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares (the
"Top-Up Closing"), which shall take place at the location specified in 
_Section 1.6_ and shall be deemed to occur immediately following the Offer
Closing and immediately preceding the Merger Closing, the purchase price owed
by Acquisition Sub to the Company therefor shall be paid to the Company,
at Acquisition Subs option, (i) in

 



\- 5 -  cash, by wire transfer of same-day funds, or (ii) by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal to
the aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the "Promissory
Note"). The Promissory Note (i) shall be executed by Parent and Acquisition
Sub and shall be due on the first (1st) anniversary of the Top-Up Closing,
(ii) shall bear simple interest of five percent (5%) per annum payable in
arrears at the time the Promissory Note is repaid, (iii) shall be full
recourse against Parent and Acquisition Sub, (iv) may be prepaid, in whole or
in part, at any time without premium or penalty, and (v) shall have no other
material terms. At the Top-Up Closing, the Company shall cause to be issued to
Acquisition Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Option Shares.

 

(c) Parent and Acquisition Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Acquisition Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Acquisition Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that
Acquisition Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an
"accredited investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the
Securities Act. Acquisition Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up
Option Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and
will be acquired by Acquisition Sub for the purpose of investment and not with
a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof (within
the meaning of the Securities Act).

(d) Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company acknowledge and agree that, in any
appraisal proceeding related to this Agreement, the fair value of the shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the appraisal proceeding shall be
determined in accordance with the DGCL without regard to the exercise by
Acquisition Sub of the Top-Up Option, any shares of Company Common Stock
issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Promissory Note.

(e) If the Top-Up Option is exercised, the parties hereto agree to
use commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the closing of the purchase
of the Top-Up Option Shares, including the payment for such shares, to occur
on the same day that the Top-Up notice is deemed received by the Company, and
if not so consummated on such day, as promptly thereafter as possible. If the
Top-Up Option is exercised, the parties hereto further agree to use
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated in
accordance with Section 253 of the DGCL, as close in time as possible to
(including, to the extent possible, on the same day as) the issuance of the
Top-Up Option Shares. Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company shall cooperate
to ensure that any issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares is accomplished in a
manner consistent with all applicable Laws.

(f) Without the prior written consent of the Company, the right to exercise
the Top-Up Option granted pursuant to this Agreement may be exercised only
once and shall not be assigned by Parent or Acquisition Sub. Any attempted
assignment in violation of this _Section 1.3(f)_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 1.4 _Directors_.

 

(a) Subject to applicable Law, promptly after Acquisition Sub accepts for
payment and pays for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered and not
withdrawn pursuant to the Offer (the "Appointment Time"), and at all times
thereafter, Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to elect or designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on the board
of directors of the Company as is equal to the product of the total number of
directors on the board of directors of the Company (giving effect to the
directors elected or designated by Acquisition Sub pursuant to this _Section
1.4_) multiplied by the percentage that the aggregate number of shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and Acquisition Sub bears to
the total number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to applicable Law, and for so long as

 



\- 6 -  Parent and its subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, beneficially own in the
aggregate more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding shares of Company
Stock, Acquisition Sub shall be entitled to designate at least a majority of
the directors on the board of directors of the Company at all times following
the Appointment Time. Upon Acquisition Subs request at any time following the
Appointment Time, the Company shall, subject to the terms of the Second
Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of
the Company, take such actions, including but not limited to filling vacancies
or newly created directorships on the board of directors of the Company,
increasing the size of the board of directors of the Company (including by
amending the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company if necessary so as to
increase the size of the board of directors of the Company) and/or
requesting and accepting the resignations of such number of its incumbent
directors, as is reasonably necessary to enable Acquisition Subs designees to
be so elected or designated to the board of directors of the Company, and
shall cause Acquisition Subs designees to be so elected or designated at
such time. The Company shall, upon Acquisition Subs request following the
Appointment Time, also cause persons elected or designated by Acquisition Sub
to constitute at least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole
number) as is on the board of directors of the Company of (i) each committee
of the board of directors of the Company, (ii) each board of directors (or
similar body) of each subsidiary of the Company, and (iii) each committee (or
similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable Law. The Companys obligations under this _Section 1.4(a)_ shall
be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder. The Company shall promptly upon execution of this Agreement take
all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to
fulfill its obligations under this  _Section 1.4(a)_, including mailing to
the Companys stockholders (together with the Schedule 14D-9, unless otherwise
requested by Parent) the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
as is necessary to enable Acquisition Subs designees to be elected or
designated to the board of directors of the Company. Parent shall supply the
Company with, and solely be responsible for, information with respect to
Acquisition Subs designees and Parents and Acquisition Subs respective
officers, directors and affiliates to the extent required by Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1. The provisions of this _Section 1.4(a)_ are in addition to and
shall not limit any rights that any of Acquisition Sub, Parent or any of
their respective affiliates may have as a record holder or beneficial owner of
shares of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to
the election of directors or otherwise.

 

(b) In the event that Acquisition Subs designees are elected or designated to
the board of directors of the Company pursuant to  _Section 1.4(a)_, then,
until the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable efforts to
cause the board of directors of the Company to maintain three directors who
are (i) members of the board of directors of the Company on the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) "independent" for purposes of Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange
Act and also eligible to serve on the Companys audit committee under the
Exchange Act and at least one (1) of whom shall be an "audit committee
financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of Regulation S-K and the
instructions thereto (the "Continuing Directors"); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if any Continuing Director is unable to serve due to death, disability
or resignation, the Company shall take all necessary action (including
creating a committee of the board of directors of the Company) so that the
Continuing Director(s) shall be entitled to elect or designate another person
(or persons) to fill such vacancy, and such person (or persons) shall be
deemed to be a Continuing Director for purposes of this Agreement. If no
Continuing Director then remains, the other directors shall designate
three (3) persons who shall each qualify as "independent" for purposes of
Rule 10A-3 of the Exchange Act and eligible to serve on the Companys audit
committee under the Exchange Act and at least one (1) of whom shall be
an "audit committee financial expert" as defined in Item 407(d)(5)(ii) of
Regulation S-K and the instructions thereto, to fill such vacancies and such
persons shall be deemed Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if any
of Acquisition Subs designees have been elected or appointed to the board of
directors of the Company after the Appointment Time and prior to the Effective
Time, then the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be
required to authorize any of the following actions of the Company (each, an
"Adverse Action"), in addition to the approvals by the board 

 



\- 7 -  of directors or the stockholders of the Company that may be required by the
Second Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws
of the Company or applicable Law, (i) to amend, modify or terminate this
Agreement, or agree or consent to any amendment, modification or termination
of this Agreement, (ii) to extend the time of performance of, or waive, any of
the obligations or other acts of Parent or Acquisition Sub under this
Agreement, or to exercise or waive any of the Companys rights, benefits or
remedies hereunder, (iii) except as provided herein, to amend the governing
documents of the Company, or (iv) to make any determination or give any
approval or authorization that is required to be taken or given by the
Companys board of directors with respect to any action to be taken or not to
be taken by or on behalf of the Company relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, or (v) to take any other
action or make any other determination of the Companys board of directors
under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. The
Continuing Directors shall have, and Parent shall cause the Continuing
Directors to have, the authority to retain such counsel (which may include
current counsel to the Company or the board of directors of the Company) and
other advisors at the expense of the Company as determined by the Continuing
Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf of the Company
to enforce performance of this Agreement. Following the Appointment Time and
prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Acquisition Sub shall take
any action to remove any Continuing Director.

Section 1.5 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time,
Acquisition Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the
separate existence of Acquisition Sub shall cease, and the Company shall
continue under the name "Kaydon Corporation" as the surviving corporation
(the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of
the State of Delaware.

 

Section 1.6 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ , the closing of the Merger (the
"Merger Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time)

LLP, 75 E. 55th Street, New York, New York 10022, except in the event of
a 251(h) Inapplicable Determination, in which case no later than the second

applicable Laws) waiver of the last to be satisfied or waived of the
conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or
(to the extent permitted by applicable Laws) waiver of those conditions) or
at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing by the
parties (such date being the "Merger Closing Date"), provided that the Merger
Closing Date shall be effected as soon as practicable following the Offer
Closing.

Section 1.7 _Effective Time_. Concurrently with the Merger Closing, the
Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub shall cause a certificate of merger or
certificate of ownership and merger, as the case may be (the "Certificate of
Merger"), with respect to the Merger to be executed and filed with the
Secretary of State as provided under the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective on the date and time at which the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the Secretary of State or at such other date and time as is

date and time being hereinafter referred to as the "Effective Time").

Section 1.8 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. Subject to _Section
5.7_, at the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to be identical to the certificate

ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

Section 2.1 _Effect on Securities_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company, Acquisition
Sub or the holders of any securities of Parent, the Company or Acquisition
Sub, the following shall occur:

 

(a) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
held by the Company as treasury stock or held by any subsidiary of the
Company, Parent or Acquisition Sub (including as a result of the exercise of
the Top-Up Option by Acquisition Sub, if applicable) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in
respect thereof.

(b) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Except as otherwise provided in
_Section 2.1(a)_, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the "Merger Consideration"). Each share of Company Common Stock to
be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this _Section 2.1(b)_ shall be automatically canceled and shall cease to
exist, and the holders of stock certificates representing Company Common Stock
(the "Certificates") or book-entry shares ("Book-Entry Shares") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other
than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares in accordance with _Section 2.2_, the Merger Consideration.

(c) _Conversion of Acquisition Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, each share of common stock, par value of $0.01 per share, of
Acquisition Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one (1) fully paid share of common stock,
par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and constitute the
only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if
at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification,

 



\- 9 -  recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or
combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock) with a record date during such period,
the Offer Price and Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such change and such adjustment shall provide the
Companys stockholders the same economic effect as contemplated by this
Agreement prior to such action.

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company (the
"Paying Agent"), the identity and the terms of appointment of which shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company, for the payment of the Merger
Consideration as provided in  _Section 2.1(b)_ and _Section 2.3_.
Immediately upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of
State, Parent shall, or shall take all steps necessary to enable and cause
Acquisition Sub to, deposit with the Paying Agent, cash constituting an
amount equal to the Total Common Merger Consideration (such Total Common
Merger Consideration as deposited with the Paying Agent, the "Exchange Fund").
In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments
contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)_, Parent shall promptly deposit, or cause to
be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount that is
equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment and such
additional funds will be deemed to be part of the Exchange Fund. Parent shall
cause the Exchange Fund to be held for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock and applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to 
_Section 2.1(b)_. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than to fund payments pursuant to _Section 2.2(c)_, except as expressly
provided for in this Agreement.

 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event
not later than the fifth (5th) Business Day thereafter, the Surviving
Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for
collection by hand) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (i) a letter of transmittal, which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have
such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted pursuant to this
Agreement (which instructions shall provide that, at the election of the
surrendering holder, (x) Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may be surrendered
by hand delivery or otherwise or (y) the Merger Consideration in exchange
therefor may be collected by hand by the surrendering holder or by wire
transfer to the surrendering holder).

 

(c) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter
of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to
such instructions (including any necessary Tax forms), the holder of
such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive promptly in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be
mailed, made available for collection by hand or delivered by wire transfer,
as elected by the surrendering holder, within two (2) Business Days following
the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the Paying Agents
receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-
Entry Share, and such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith

 



\- 10 -  canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be issued to a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered is registered (the
"Transferee") if such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is properly endorsed or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Transferee pays any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of such payment to a person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share or establishes to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Taxes have been paid or are
not applicable. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificate (or affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration payable upon the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have
not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation as general creditor thereof for payment of their
claims for cash, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled.

 

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in
respect of any cash held in the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately
prior to the date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority, any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the
property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent or, after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that (i) no such investment or
losses thereon shall relieve Parent or the Paying Agent from making the
payments required by this _Article II_ or affect the amount of
Merger Consideration payable to the Companys stockholders, and following any
losses Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent in
accordance with _Section 2.2(a)_, (ii) no such investment shall have
maturities that could prevent or delay payments to be made pursuant to this
Agreement, and (iii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of
the United States of America with maturities of no more than thirty (30) days
or guaranteed by, and backed by the full faith and credit of, the United
States of America. Any interest or other income produced by such investments
will be payable to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as directed by Parent.

 

Section 2.3 _Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Offer Closing, each Company Option that is outstanding
and unvested immediately prior to the Offer Closing shall become fully vested
and exercisable. As of the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option
in consideration for the right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly
as reasonably practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment with
respect thereto equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (B) the excess, if any, of the Offer Price over the
exercise price per share of Company

 



\- 11 -  Common Stock subject to such Company Option, less any required withholding
Taxes (the "Option Cash Payment," and the sum of all such payments, the "Total
Option Cash Payments"); _provided_ , that, if the exercise price per share of
any such Company Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger
Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled and terminated without
any cash payment made in respect thereof. As of the Effective Time, all
Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
terminate and cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
Option Cash Payment in respect thereof. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section 2.3(a)_
under the Company Stock Plan and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all notices and making any determinations and/or
resolutions of the board of directors of the Company or a committee thereof.

 

(b) Effective as of the Offer Closing, (i) each share of Company Restricted
Stock shall become fully vested, and the restrictions thereon shall lapse,
(ii) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to the target number of
the applicable award of Company Performance Shares shall become fully vested
and the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and the portion of such award
of Company Performance Shares that exceeds the target number shall be
forfeited, and (iii) a number of shares of Company Common Stock equal to
quotient of the accrued but unpaid cash dividends on the target number of
Company Performance Shares over the Merger Consideration shall be issued. All
such vested shares of Company Restricted Stock and Company Performance Shares
shall be treated identically to all other shares of Company Common Stock with
respect to the payment of Merger Consideration. The Company shall take all
actions necessary to effect the transactions contemplated by this _Section
2.3(b)_ under the Company Stock Plan and any other plan or arrangement of the
Company, including delivering all notices and making any determinations
and/or resolutions of the board of directors of the Company or a committee
thereof.

(c) As of the Offer Closing, each Company Phantom Share shall be converted
into the right to receive a payment equal to the Merger Consideration. The
Company shall take all actions necessary to effect the transactions
contemplated by this _Section 2.3(c)_ under the Company Stock Plan and any
other plan or arrangement of the Company, including delivering all notices and
making any determinations and/or resolutions of the board of directors of the
Company or a committee thereof.

 

Section 2.4 _Withholdings_. Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving
Corporation, and the Paying Agent (without duplication) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock, Company Restricted Stock or Company Options, such
amounts as Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code or any provision of applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority
by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent. Parent, Acquisition Sub, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall take all action that may be necessary to ensure that any
such amounts so withheld are promptly and properly remitted to
the appropriate taxing authority. The parties hereto agree to cooperate in
good faith in requesting and providing any information or documentation
allowing for the reduction or elimination of any such withholding.

 

Section 2.5 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond,

indemnity against any claim that may be

 



\- 12 -  made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this
_Article II_.

Section 2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.1(b)_, to the
extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised
and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Section 262 of the
DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such
holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost his or her right to appraisal and payment under the DGCL, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such holders shares of Company
Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any
interest thereon, and such shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares.
The Total Common Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for
dollar basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a
stockholder on the Merger Closing Date. Any portion of the Total Common Merger
Consideration made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to  _Section 2.2_
to pay for Dissenting Shares will be returned to Parent upon demand. The
Company shall give Parent (a) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal or payment of the fair value of any shares of Company Common
Stock or withdrawals of such demands and (b) the opportunity to participate
in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company will not, without the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Parent shall not, except with
the prior written consent of the Company, require the Company to make any
payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

 

Section 2.7 _Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights_. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books
of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall
be canceled against delivery of the applicable Merger Consideration, as
provided for in _Section 2.1(b)_, for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificates.

statements disclaimer) or (b) as disclosed in the correspondingly numbered
section of the separate disclosure letter which has been delivered by the
Company to Parent prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company

corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority and
all necessary governmental approvals to own, lease and operate its properties

Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company and its subsidiaries is duly
qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good
standing, in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter lists each
subsidiary of the Company and its jurisdiction of formation or incorporation.

 

(b) All the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other equity
interests in, each of the Companys subsidiaries have been validly issued and

securities of, and other equity interests in, the Companys subsidiaries, the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or voting

venture, association, limited liability company, trust, unincorporated
organization or other entity.

 

Section 3.2 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. The Second Restated
Certificate of Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the

Merger set forth in _Annex I_ and _Article VI_ to be satisfied, including (i)
the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, consents and approvals
from Governmental Authorities or other persons necessary in connection with
the consummation of the

 



\- 34 -  Transactions, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings

required to be filed under any applicable foreign antitrust or competition-
related Law of the jurisdictions set forth in _Section 3.5_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter in connection with Transactions within five (5) Business
Days following the date of this Agreement.

 

(b) Parent and the Company will comply at the earliest practicable time, and
in any event no later than required by the Governmental Authority, with any
request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
it from any Governmental Authorities with respect to CFIUS Notice or ITAR
Notice and will cooperate with the other parties hereto in connection
with CFIUS Filing and ITAR filing. Parent and Company will each use its best
efforts to promptly inform the other parties of any oral communication with,
and to the extent they do not contain confidential information unrelated to
the Transactions, provide copies of written communications with, any
Governmental Authority regarding any such filings. Without the consent of the
other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned), no party will independently participate in any scheduled
meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Authority in respect of such
filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior
notice of the meeting and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental
Authority, the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting. Neither
Parent nor Company shall withdraw the CFIUS Filing or ITAR filing or take any
other step that has the effect of suspending, extending or terminating
any applicable waiting period, nor shall Parent or Company enter into any
agreement with a Governmental Authority not to consummate (or regarding the
timing of consummation of) the Transactions, without the prior written consent
of the other party.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall take or

file appropriate applications with any Governmental Authority in connection
with any of the foregoing and in the case of actions by or with

 



\- 35 -  respect to the Company or its subsidiaries or its or their businesses or
assets; by consenting to such action by the Company and provided, that any
such action may, at the discretion of the Company, be conditioned upon
consummation of the Offer or the Merger) (each a "Divestiture Action") to
ensure that no Governmental Entity enters any order, decision, judgment,
decree, ruling, injunction (preliminary or permanent), or establishes any
law, rule, regulation or other action preliminarily or permanently
restraining, enjoining or prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger, or to ensure that no Governmental Authority with the authority to
clear, authorize or otherwise approve the consummation of the Offer or the
Merger, fails to do so by the Termination Date. In the event that any action
is threatened or instituted challenging the Offer or the Merger as violative
of any Antitrust Law or Exon-Florio or with respect to CFIUS, Parent shall
take all action necessary, including but not limited to any Divestiture Action
to avoid or resolve such action. Notwithstanding anything contained herein
(including this _Section 5.4_), Parent shall not be required under any
circumstance to propose, negotiate, commit to or undertake any Divestiture
Acton that would result in a material adverse effect on the combined
businesses of SKF USA (and its subsidiaries) and the Company (and its
subsidiaries), taken as a whole. In the event that any permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order is threatened or becomes reasonably
foreseeable to be entered in any proceeding that would make consummation of
the Transactions in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or
that would restrain, enjoin or otherwise prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Transactions, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or prevent such
injunction or order so as to permit such consummation prior to the Termination
Date. The Company reasonably shall cooperate with Parent and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in resisting and reducing any
Divestiture Action and any threatened or reasonably foreseeable permanent or
preliminary injunction or other order.

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective
subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and the Company shall use,
and cause each of its affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts, and
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the Company in
its efforts, to obtain any Third Party consents not covered by paragraphs (a)
and (b) and identified on _Section 5.4(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to make any
payment in connection with the Companys or its affiliates obligations under
this _Section 5.4(d)_. Each of the parties hereto (i) will furnish to the
other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may
request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental
filings or submissions and (ii) will cooperate in responding to any inquiry
from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the other
party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations
or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with
copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between
either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement.

this _Section 5.4(d)_ shall not be considered a condition to the obligations
of Parent and Acquisition Sub to consummate the Offer or the Merger.

Section 5.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

records (including Tax records and Tax Returns), agreements, and directors,
managers, officers, representatives and other information as Parent may
reasonably request regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and
other aspects of the Company and its subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ ,
any such access shall be conducted at Parents expense, at a reasonable time,
under the supervision of appropriate 

 



\- 36 -  personnel of the Company, and in such a manner as to not interfere
unreasonably with the normal operation of the business of the Company;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall not be required to provide
access to any information or documents which would, in the reasonable judgment
of the Company, (i) breach any agreement with any Third Party, (ii) constitute
a waiver of the attorney-client or other privilege held by the Company (it
being agreed that the Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it
is withholding such information or documents pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii)
above and thereafter the Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection or violate the
applicable restriction), (iii) contravene any applicable Law or (iv) relate
to or include the evaluation, deliberations or minutes of the board of
directors of the Company (or any committee thereof) related to the
Transactions or any other strategic alternatives involving the Company or any
materials provided to the board of directors of the Company (or any committee
thereof) in connection therewith.

(b) The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the
Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.

engage in discussions and negotiations with, and furnish non-
public information relating to the Company and its subsidiaries and afford
access to the books and records of the Company and its subsidiaries to any
Third Party in connection with a Competing Proposal or any inquiry,
discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal; _provided_ , that prior to furnishing such information or
affording such access, the Company has entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party and has previously provided
or made available (or substantially concurrently provides or makes available)
such information to Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 5.6 to
the contrary, the Company shall not, and shall not permit its subsidiaries
to, reimburse or agree to reimburse the expenses of any Third Party (other
than the Companys Representatives) in connection with a Competing Proposal or
any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be
expected to lead to a Competing Proposal.

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section 5.6_ and except with an Excluded

such pending Competing Proposal); and (ii) deliver to Parent unredacted copies
of all proposed transaction documents received by the Company or any of its
Representatives from any such Excluded Party or its Representatives including
any financing commitments (including redacted fee letters) related thereto. In
addition, from and after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company

to lead to any Competing Proposal, (i) deliver to Parent a written notice
setting forth: (A) the identity of the Third Party making such Competing

to Parent unredacted copies of all proposed transaction documents received by
the Company or any of its Representatives from any such Third Party or
its Representatives relating to any such Competing Proposal, including any
financing commitments (including redacted fee letters) related thereto. The
Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of any material amendment or
modification of any such Competing Proposal, inquiry or request on a
reasonably prompt basis, and in any event within two (2) Business Days
thereof. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.6_ to the contrary, the
Company shall not, and shall not permit its subsidiaries to, reimburse or
agree to reimburse the expenses of any Third Party (other than the Companys
Representatives) in connection with a Competing Proposal or any inquiry,
discussion, offer or request that could reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal.

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.6_, the Company shall
not, shall cause its directors, officers and subsidiaries not to, and shall
cause each of its Representatives and its subsidiaries Representatives not
to, from the expiration of the Go-Shop Period until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated

to the knowledge of the Company, is seeking to make, or has made, a Competing
Proposal or (iii) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal
(an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

(e) At any time after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the
Offer Closing, the Company or its board of directors, directly or indirectly
through its Representatives, may (i) furnish nonpublic information to any
Third Party making a Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that prior
to so furnishing such information, the Company has entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Third Party and previously provided such
information to Parent), and (ii) engage in discussions or negotiations with
such Third Party with respect to the Competing Proposal, in each case if: (x)
such Third Party has submitted a bona fide written Competing Proposal that did
not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.6_ and that the board
of directors of the Company, or any duly authorized committee thereof,
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior
Proposal, and (y) the board of directors of the Company, or any duly
authorized committee thereof, determines in good faith, after consultation
with legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably
likely to be inconsistent with the

 



\- 38 -  directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law. Prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in this _Section 5.6(e)_, the Company shall notify Parent
and Acquisition Sub orally and in writing that it proposes to furnish non-
public information and/or enter into discussions or negotiations as provided
in this _Section 5.6(e)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this  _Section 5.6_, prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall be
permitted to take the actions described in _Section 5.6(a)_ and _Section
5.6(d)_ (other than in clause (d)(iii), except to the extent effected
in accordance with this Agreement) and clauses (i) and (ii) above with
respect to any Excluded Party for so long as such person is an Excluded Party,
including with respect to any amended or revised proposal submitted by such
Excluded Party following the Go-Shop Period, and the restrictions in _Section
5.6(d)_ (other than in clause (d)(iii), except to the extent effected in
accordance with this Agreement) shall not apply with respect thereto.

 

(f) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.6(f)_, neither the board
of directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold,
withdraw, qualify or modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Acquisition Sub, the
Company Recommendation or fail to include the Company Recommendation in
the Schedule 14D-9; or (ii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Competing Proposal (any of the
actions described in clauses (i) and (ii) of this _Section 5.6(f)_,
an "Adverse Recommendation Change"); or (iii) cause or permit the Company or
any of its subsidiaries to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Offer Closing, the board of directors of the Company
shall be permitted (x) to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this _Section 5.6_,
subject to compliance with _Section 5.6(g)_ and _Section 7.3_, if the board
of directors of the Company (A) has received a Competing Proposal that,
in the good faith determination of the board of directors of the Company,
constitutes, a Superior Proposal, after having complied with, and giving
effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent and
Acquisition Sub pursuant to,  _Section 5.6(g)_, and (B) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such
action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, or (y) to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition, solely as a
result of an Intervening Event if the board of directors of the Company
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(g) The Company shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse Recommendation
Change or to terminate this Agreement as permitted under  _Section 5.6(f)_
with respect to a Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has provided prior
written notice at least three (3) full Business Days in advance (and does not
take action until after 12:01 a.m. on the day following such third (3rd) full
Business Day) (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") to Parent and Acquisition Sub
that the Company intends to take such action and describing the
material terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of
such action (including the identity of the Third Party and unredacted copies
of all proposed transaction documents, including any financing commitments and
redacted fee letters related thereto), (ii) during the three (3) Business Day
period following Parents and Acquisition Subs receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its Representatives to,
negotiate with Parent and Acquisition Sub in good faith (to the extent Parent
and Acquisition Sub desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute a Superior Proposal, (iii) following the end of the three (3)
Business Day period, the board of directors of the Company shall have
determined in good faith, after consultation with its legal and financial
advisors and taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent and Acquisition Sub in response to the Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv) in the
event of any material amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Superior Proposal, a

 



\- 39 -  new Notice of Superior Proposal shall have been provided by the Company to
Parent and the Company shall be required to comply again with the requirements
of this _Section 5.6(g)_, except that references to the three (3) Business
Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2) Business Day
period; _provided_ , that any purported termination of this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ shall be void and of no force or effect unless the
Company pays Parent the Termination Fee in accordance with _Section
7.3(a)(ii)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination.

 

(h) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
board of directors of the Company, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders
a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party
pursuant to Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act (or
any similar communication to the Companys stockholders), or (ii) making any
"stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to the Companys stockholders) if the board of
directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after consultation with
legal counsel, that the failure to do so would be reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any disclosures permitted under this _Section
5.6(h)(ii)_ shall not be a basis, in themselves for Parent to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to  _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_.

(i) From the date hereof until the end of the Go-Shop Period, the Company
shall be permitted to grant a Standstill Waiver with respect to the Company
or any of its subsidiaries in compliance with this _Section 5.6_. After the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period, the Company shall not grant any waiver or
release under any "standstill" or similar obligation with respect to the
Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided, however, at any time prior to
the Offer Closing, the board of directors of the Company may grant a waiver or
release under any standstill agreement with respect to the Company or any of
its subsidiaries if the board of directors of the Company, or any duly
authorized committee thereof, determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action would
be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. Except as contemplated by this _Section 5.6(i)_, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to enforce, and shall not
release or permit the release of any Third Party from, or amend, waive,
terminate or modify, and shall not permit the amendment, waiver, termination
or modification of, any provision of, any confidentiality or similar agreement
to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or under which the
Company or any of its subsidiaries has any rights. The Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Representatives to, enter into any confidentiality
agreement subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Company from providing to Parent the information specifically required to be
provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.6_.

 

(j) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the Transactions, any bona
fide written proposal or offer (other than a proposal or offer by Parent,
Acquisition Sub or any of its subsidiaries), including any amendments,
adjustments, changes, revisions and supplements thereto, from a Third Party
relating to (i) a merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, dissolution,
liquidation, joint venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any
of its subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the Company as
determined on a book-value basis; (ii) the acquisition (whether by merger,
consolidation, equity investment, joint venture or otherwise) by any Third
Party of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries, taken as a whole as determined on a book-value basis; (iii) the
acquisition in any manner, directly or indirectly, by any Third Party of
fifteen percent (15%) or more of the issued and outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, or (iv) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange
offer that,

 



\- 40 -  if consummated, would result in any Third Party beneficially owning fifteen
percent (15%) or more of the Company Common Stock or any class of equity or
voting securities of the Company or any of its subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company as determined on a book-value basis.

 

(ii) "Excluded Party" shall mean any person, group of persons or group that
includes any person (so long as such person and the other members of such
group, if any, who were members of such group immediately prior to the
expiration of the Go-Shop Period constitute at least fifty percent (50%) of
the equity financing (measured by vote and value) such group at all times
following the expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the termination of
this Agreement) from which the Company received during the Go-Shop Period a
written Competing Proposal that: (a) remains pending as of, and shall not have
been withdrawn prior to, the expiration of the Go-Shop Period; and (b) the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith during the one (1)
Business Day period commencing upon the expiration of the Go-Shop Period,
after consultation with the Companys financial and legal advisors,
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal;
_provided_ , _however_ , that a person that is an Excluded Party shall cease
to be an Excluded Party upon the withdrawal, termination or expiration of
such Competing Proposal (as it may be amended, adjusted, changed, revised,
extended and supplemented).

 

(iii) "Superior Proposal" shall mean a written Competing Proposal (with all
percentages in the definition of Competing Proposal increased to fifty
percent (50%)) made by a Third Party on terms that the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys
financial and legal advisors, is more favorable to the Companys stockholders
from a financial point of view than the terms of the Offer or the Merger
(after giving effect to all adjustments to the terms thereof which may be
offered by Parent in writing (including pursuant to  _Section 5.6(g)))_.

Section 5.7 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Acquisition Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
advancement of expenses and indemnification for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or
after the Effective Time (including any matters arising in connection with the
Transactions), existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the
current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case may be, of
the Company or its subsidiaries as provided in the Companys or each of the
Companys subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational or governing documents) or in any
agreement, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and
effect. After the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
(and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) (i) indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, and advance expenses to, Indemnitees with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such at any time prior to the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent required by: (x) the Second Restated
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws (or equivalent organizational or
governing documents) of the Company or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates
as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (y) any indemnification
agreement of the Company or its subsidiaries or other applicable contract as
in effect on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions referenced in subsections (i)(x) and (y)
above in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any
Indemnitees with respect to any acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time.

 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 5.7(a)_, during the period
commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will, to the same
extent as such persons are indemnified or have the right to advancement of
expenses as of the date hereof under the Second Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company and the
equivalent organizational or governing

 



\- 41 -  documents of each of the Companys subsidiaries: (i) indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, inquiries, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, to the extent such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation arises out of or pertains to: (x) any action or
omission or alleged action or omission in such Indemnitees capacity as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates; or (y) the Offer, the Merger, the Merger Agreement
and any Transactions; and (ii) advance prior to the final disposition of any
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation the expenses
(including attorneys fees) of any Indemnitee upon receipt of an undertaking
by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall ultimately
be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 5.7(b)_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation
shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek
termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section
5.7(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes
an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of
such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, and does not include an
admission of fault or wrongdoing by any Indemnitee.

 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of
the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys existing
directors and officers insurance policies and the Companys existing
fiduciary liability insurance policies (collectively, the "DandO Insurance"), in
each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years
from and after the Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any
period of time at or prior to the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance
carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the
coverage provided under the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date of
this Agreement with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with
terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under the Companys
existing policies as of the date of this Agreement, or (ii) Parent will
provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not
less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are
insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable DandO Insurance that
provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time from
an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Companys
current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable than the existing policy
of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is
unavailable, the best available coverage; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium
for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid
by the Company for such insurance; and _provided_ _further_ , that if the
annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available at an annual premium equal to 300% of the annual premium
currently paid by the Company, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.7_ applies shall be Third Party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.7_. The provisions of this _Section 5.7_
are intended to be for the benefit of

 



\- 42 -  each Indemnitee and his or her successors, heirs or representatives. Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, all reasonable expenses, including attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully enforcing the
indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.7_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 5.7_ shall be in
addition to any rights such person may have under the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of
its subsidiaries, or under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any
Indemnitee with the Company or any of its subsidiaries.

(f) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective subsidiaries or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at
Parents option, Parent, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in
this _Section 5.7_.

(g) Notwithstanding anything contained in  _Section 8.1_ or _Section 8.7_
to the contrary, this _Section 5.7_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on the successors and
assigns of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries, and shall
be enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or
representatives.

 

Section 5.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with this Agreement or any of the Transactions, or
from any person alleging that the consent of such person is or may be
required in connection with any of the Transactions, if the subject matter of
such communication or the failure of such party to obtain such consent could
reasonably be expected to be material to the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, (b) any actions, suits, claims, investigations by a
Governmental Authority or proceedings commenced or, to such partys knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its subsidiaries which relate to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or
its directors relating to the Transactions, and (c) the discovery by such
party of any fact, circumstance or event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which could reasonably be expected, individually or taken together with all
other existing facts, events and circumstances known to such party, to cause
or result in any of the conditions of the obligations of such party to
consummate the Merger as set forth in _Article VI_ or the Offer not to be
satisfied or the satisfaction of which to be materially delayed. In the event
of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors
relating to the Transactions, the Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation and no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.8_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice or the
representations or warranties or covenants of the parties or the conditions
to the obligations of the parties hereunder.

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. The Company, Parent and Acquisition Sub
shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the
opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or otherwise making
any public statements with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, and
none of the parties shall issue any such press release or make any public
statement prior to obtaining the other parties consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned); _provided_ , that each
party may issue any such press release or make such public announcement it
believes in good faith is required to be made by applicable Law, Order or
applicable

 



\- 43 -  stock exchange rule or any listing agreement of any party hereto; _provided_
, _further_ , that the party seeking to issue or cause the publication of any
press release with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions shall not be
required to provide to the other party an opportunity to review or comment on
any disclosure relating to any Superior Proposal or Adverse Recommendation
Change. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with
respect to the Transactions shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the
parties

Section 5.10  _Employee Matters_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall assume and honor or cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume and honor the Collective Bargaining
Agreements. During the one (1)-year period commencing at the Effective Time,
Parent shall provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to
employees of the Company and any of its subsidiaries whose terms and
conditions of employment are not governed by any Collective Bargaining
Agreements ("Non-Union Company Employees" and, collectively with employees of
the Company and any of its subsidiaries whose terms and conditions
of employment are governed by Collective Bargaining Agreements, the "Company
Employees") a base salary or wage rate at least equal to the Non-Union Company
Employees base salary or wage rate in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and compensation and benefits (excluding equity-based
compensation and benefits provided under any defined benefit pension plan)
that are, in the aggregate for all such employees as a group, no less
favorable than to the compensation and benefits being provided to Non-Union
Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall pay or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each Company Employee who is
otherwise entitled to an annual cash bonus for the 2013 bonus year an annual
cash bonus (or, if applicable, pro rata bonus) for the 2013 bonus year at the
time such annual cash bonus would otherwise be paid in the ordinary course of
business in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan,
at a level based on the Companys or applicable business units full year
performance, as established and calculated by the Company for financial
statement purposes as of June 29, 2013; provided that any Company Employee
whose employment with the Company, Parent or their affiliates is terminated
following the Effective Time but prior to December 31, 2013 without "Cause"
(within the meaning of the Companys Severance Plan as in effect immediately
before the date hereof) shall receive an annual cash bonus, prorated based on
the number of full months employed during the 2013 bonus year, no later than
the second (2nd) payroll period after the date of such termination (except to
the extent that the receipt of such pro-rated bonus would duplicate benefits
such Company Employee is otherwise entitled to pursuant to (i) or (ii) below
or pursuant to another severance plan or agreement), and except as otherwise
provided under any applicable Company Benefit Plan any Company Employee who
resigns or is terminated by the Company for "Cause" prior to December 31, 2013
shall not be entitled to receive any bonus payment. In addition,
notwithstanding the foregoing, certain Company Employees shall be eligible for
severance benefits as set forth in _Section 5.10(a)(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter. The Company shall take all actions necessary, including
amending the applicable annual bonus plan(s), to effect the provisions of this
_Section 5.10(a)_.

 

(b) For purposes of eligibility, determination of level of benefits and
vesting but not benefit accrual under the compensation and benefit plans,
programs agreements and arrangements of Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any respective subsidiary and affiliate thereof providing
benefits to any Company Employees after the Merger Closing Date, other than
defined benefit plans (the "New Plans"), including for purposes of accrual of
vacation and other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each
Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
Company, the Company subsidiaries and their respective affiliates (and any
additional service with any predecessor employer) before the Merger Closing
Date, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the
Merger Closing Date, to credit for such service under any similar Company
Benefit Plan (except to the extent such service credit will result in the
duplication of

 



\- 44 -  benefits). In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to
participate, without any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent
coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Company
Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before
the replacement; and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing medical,
dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work
requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her
covered dependents, and Parent shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents under a Company Benefit Plan
during the portion of the plan year prior to the Effective Time to be taken
into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible,
co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year
as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, shall (i) confer upon any
employee of Company or any of its subsidiaries, or any representative of any
such employee, any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or
continued employment for any period or terms of employment, for any nature
whatsoever, (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any employee of the Company or any of its subsidiaries,
including the amendment or termination of any employee benefit
or compensation plan, program or arrangement, after the Merger Closing Date
or (iii) be construed to amend any Company Benefit Plan or any other employee
benefit or compensation plan, program or arrangement of the Company, Parent,
or any affiliate of either.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary
to:

 

(i) effectuate _Section 2.3(a)_ (including providing any required notices and
obtaining any required consents); and

 

(ii) ensure following the Effective Time that no holder (or former holder) of
Company Options, or any participant (or former participant) in any Company
Benefit Plan shall have any right thereunder to acquire any shares of capital
stock or voting securities of, or other equity interests (including "phantom"

subsidiaries operations prior to the Offer Closing. Prior to the Offer

obligations of each party to consummate the Merger are subject to the
satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Company and
Parent at or prior to the Effective Time of the following conditions:

 

(a) no Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated,
enforced or entered any Law or Order which is then in effect and has the

consummation of the Offer or the Merger;

(b) Acquisition Sub shall have accepted for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer;
and

 

(c) If there has been a 251(h) Inapplicable Determination and the Required

Section 6.2 _Frustration of Conditions_. None of the Company, Parent or
Acquisition Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in this

obligations set forth in this Agreement.

 



\- 46 - ARTICLE VII

 

 _TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER_

 

Section 7.1 _Termination_. Notwithstanding anything contained in this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement may be terminated at any time prior
to the Effective Time (except as otherwise expressly noted), as follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of each of Parent and the Company; or

(b) by either Parent or the Company, if:

 

(i) (A) the Offer Closing shall not have occurred on or before January 3, 2014
(the "Termination Date") or (B) the Offer is terminated or withdrawn pursuant
to its terms and the terms of this Agreement without any shares of Company
Common Stock being purchased thereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this  _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not
be available to a party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in the
events specified in _Section 7.1(b)(i)_; or 

(ii) (A) a Law shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting or
making illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger on the terms
contemplated hereby or (B) any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any other action permanently
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting any of the Transactions, and
such Order or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ , _however_ , the right to terminate this Agreement under this
_Section 7.1(b)(ii)(B)_ shall not be available to a party if the issuance of
such final, non-appealable Order was primarily due to the failure of such
party, and in the case of Parent, including the failure of Acquisition Sub, to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement; or

 

(c) by the Company if:

(i) Parent or Acquisition Sub shall have breached or failed to perform in any
material respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other
agreements set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform
cannot be cured on or before the Termination Date or, if curable, is not
cured by Parent within (1) fifteen (15) days of receipt by Parent of written
notice of such breach or failure or (2) any shorter period of time that
remains between the date the Company provides written notice of such breach
and the Termination Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ if the Offer Closing shall have occurred; it being acknowledged
and agreed that any termination by the Company pursuant to this _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ shall not constitute an Adverse Recommendation Change;

 

(ii) prior to the Offer Closing (x) the board of directors of the Company has
determined to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal to the extent permitted by, and subject to the terms and conditions
of, _Section 5.6_, and (y) concurrently with such termination, the Company
pays to Parent the fee specified in  _Section 7.3(a)(ii)_; or

(iii) Acquisition Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to
the date provided therefor in _Section 1.1(a)_ or consummate the Offer in
accordance with _Section 1.1_; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
shall not be permitted to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section
7.1(c)(iii)_ if Acquisition Subs failure to commence the Offer is primarily
due to the Companys material breach of this Agreement; or

 



\- 47 - (d) by Parent if:

 

(i) (x) the Company shall have breached or failed to perform in any material
respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, which breach or failure to perform (A) would
result in a failure of any Offer Condition set forth in clauses (ii) or (iii)
of paragraph (e) of _Annex I_ , and (B) cannot be cured on or before the
Termination Date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company within (1)
fifteen (15) days of receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach
or failure or (2) any shorter period of time that remains between the date
Parent provides written notice of such breach and the Termination Date or (y)
a Company Material Adverse Effect occurs or exists such that any Offer
Condition set forth in _Annex I_ becomes incapable of being met;  _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ if the Offer Closing shall have
occurred; or

 

(ii) the Company shall have materially breached _Section 5.6_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ if the Offer Closing shall have
occurred; or

(iii) (x) the board of directors of the Company shall have effected an
Adverse Recommendation Change or shall have failed to publicly reaffirm the
Company Recommendation within seven (7) Business Days of receipt of a written
request by Parent to provide such reaffirmation following the public
announcement of a Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such
seven (7) Business Days period shall be extended for an additional five (5)
Business Days following any material modification to such Competing Proposal
occurring after receipt of Parents written request and (II) such
reaffirmation may include such additional disclosures as the board of
directors of the Company determines, in good faith, after consultation with
legal counsel, would reasonably be necessary to satisfy the fiduciary duties
of the board of directors of the Company or comply with applicable Law); or
(y) the Company enters into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement; provided,
however, that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_ if the Offer Closing shall have
occurred.

 

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated and the Merger abandoned pursuant to  _Section 7.1_, written
notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties, specifying the
provisions hereof pursuant to which such termination is made and the basis
therefor described in reasonable detail, and this Agreement shall forthwith
become null and void and of no effect without liability on the part of any
party hereto (or any of their respective Representatives), and all rights and
obligations of any party hereto shall cease; _provided_ , _however_ , that
no such termination shall relieve any party hereto of any liability or
damages (which the parties acknowledge and agree shall not be limited to
reimbursement of Expenses or out-of-pocket costs) resulting from any willful
or intentional breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, in which
case the aggrieved party shall be entitled to all remedies available at law or
in equity, but subject in all cases to, and without limiting, _Section
7.3(d)_; and _provided,_   _further,_ that the Confidentiality Agreement,
this _Section 7.2_, and the provisions of _Section 5.5(b)_ (Access to
Information; Confidentiality), _Section 5.9_ (Public Announcements), _Section
7.3_ (Termination Fees), _Article VIII_ (General Provisions) and _Article
IX_ (Definitions) shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1_.

 

Section 7.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by:

 

(i) either Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ or by Parent
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_ and (A) a Competing Proposal has been made
to the Company after the date

 



\- 48 -  hereof and has been publicly made or publicly disclosed and such Competing
Proposal has not been withdrawn prior to the termination of this Agreement,
and (B) within twelve (12) months of the termination of this Agreement, the
Company (1) enters into a definitive agreement for the consummation of a
Competing Proposal (regardless of when such Competing Proposal was initially
made) and such Competing Proposal is subsequently consummated (regardless of
whether such consummation occurs within the twelve (12) month period) or (2)
consummates a Competing Proposal (regardless of when such Competing Proposal
was initially made), then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with the consummation of such
transaction arising from such Competing Proposal ( _provided_ , _however_ ,
that for purposes of this _Section 7.3(a)(i)_, the references to "fifteen
percent (15%)" in the definition of Competing Proposal shall be deemed to be
references to "fifty percent (50%)");

 

(ii) the Company pursuant to _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ then the Company shall pay,
or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination Fee concurrently with such
termination; or

(iii) Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(iii)_
then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent the Termination
Fee not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following such termination.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement:

 

(i) the parties agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee, as the case may be, on more than one occasion;

(ii) the parties agree that the Termination Fee shall be reduced by any
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under
applicable Tax Law; and

(iii) any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ shall be paid by
wire transfer of same day funds in accordance with this _Section 7.3_.

(c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Termination Fee" means an amount equal
to $34 million (subject to reduction as provided in _Section 7.3(e)_), except
that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(ii)_: (A) prior to the expiration of the Go-Shop Period or (B) after
the expiration of the Go-Shop Period and prior to the date that is ten (10)
days after the expiration of the Go-Shop Period, in connection with a
Competing Proposal from, or an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with, an
Excluded Party, the "Termination Fee" shall be an amount equal to $17 million
(subject to reduction as provided in _Section 7.3(e)_);

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 8.9_ with respect to the enforcement of the provisions
of _Section 7.3(a)_, Parents right to receive payment from the Company of
the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 7.3(a)_ shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent and Acquisition Sub against the Company and
its subsidiaries and any of their respective former, current or future general
or limited partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers,
employees, agents, affiliates or assignees (collectively, the "Company
Related Parties") for all losses and damages suffered as a result of the
failure of the Transactions to be consummated or for a breach or failure to
perform hereunder or otherwise, and upon payment of such amount, none of the
Company Related Parties shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

 

(e) In the event that Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(i)(x)_, the Company shall pay Parent or its designees, as promptly as
possible (but in any event

 



\- 49 -  within two (2) Business Days) following the delivery by Parent of an invoice
therefor, all out-of-pocket Third Party fees and expenses incurred by Parent,
Acquisition Sub and their respective affiliates in connection with the
Transactions (the "Parent Expenses"); _provided_ , that the Company shall not
be required to pay more than an aggregate of $5,000,000 million in Parent
Expenses pursuant to this  _Section 7.3(e)_; _provided_ , _further_ that the
Company shall not be required to pay any amounts pursuant to this _Section
7.3(e)_ if Parent or Acquisition Sub is in material breach of this Agreement
at the time of such termination. The payment of the expense reimbursement
pursuant to this _Section 7.3(e)_ shall not relieve the Company of any
subsequent obligation to pay the Termination Fee; provided, however, that any
payment by the Company of such expenses shall be offset against, and shall
reduce on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any applicable Termination Fee, if any,
that may become due and payable by the Company pursuant to this _Section
7.3_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit the Parents
right and remedies as provided in _Section 7.2_.

(f) In the event that the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 7.1(c)(i)_, Parent shall pay to the Company, as promptly as possible
(but in any event within two (2) Business Days) following the delivery by the
Company of an invoice therefor, all out-of-pocket Third Party fees and
expenses incurred by the Company and its affiliates in connection with the
Transactions (the "Company Expenses"); _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
required to pay more than an aggregate of $5,000,000 million in Company
Expenses pursuant to this _Section 7.3(f)_; _provided_ , _further_ that
Parent shall not be required to pay any amounts pursuant to this _Section
7.3(f)_ if the Company is in material breach of this Agreement at the time of
such termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall limit
the Companys right and remedies as provided in _Section 7.2_.

 

(g) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of the Transactions, (ii) the
Termination Fee is not a penalty, but is liquidated damages, in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such fee is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision, and (iii) without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to timely pay
any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ and, in order to obtain such
payment, the other party commences a suit that results in a judgment against
the Company or Parent, as the case may be, for the payment of any amount set
forth in this _Section 7.3_, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall
pay to the other party its reasonable, documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses in connection with such suit, together with interest on such amount
at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal in effect on the
date such payment was required to be made through the date such payment was
actually received, or such lesser rate as is the maximum permitted by
applicable Law.

Section 8.3 _Interpretation; Certain Definitions_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement.
Consequently, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties hereto, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement. When a reference is made in this Agreement to an
Article, Section, Appendix, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an
Article or Section of, or an Appendix, Annex or Exhibit to, this Agreement,
unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents and headings for this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include,"
"includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to
be followed by the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "herein"
and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The word "or" when used in this Agreement is not exclusive.
The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to
which a subject or thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".
All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used
in any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
Law defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is
referred to herein means such Law as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable
successor Laws. References to a person are also to its successors and
permitted assigns. All references to "dollars" or "$" refer to currency of the
United States of America. References to "wholly owned subsidiaries" of the
Company shall include any subsidiary of which the Company owns, directly or
indirectly, 100% of the equity interests. An Offer Condition shall be deemed
to be satisfied at any time if such Offer Condition shall not have occurred
on or prior to such time or, if such Offer Condition shall have occurred prior
to such time, such Offer Condition shall not be continuing at such time.

 

Section 8.4 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or
future Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof, (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or

 



\- 52 -  legal substance of the Offer and the Merger is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually
acceptable manner in order that the Offer and the Merger be consummated as
originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 8.5 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether
by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the
other parties hereto.

 

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Company Disclosure Letter the entire agreement, and
supersedes all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and
oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter
hereof. 

Section 8.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section
5.7_, this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer any rights or
remedies upon any person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, except for in the event the Effective Time
shall have occurred, the rights of the Companys stockholders and holders of
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Performance Shares and
Company Phantom Shares to receive the Merger Consideration and the Option Cash
Payment at the Effective Time and the other payments contemplated by 
_Section 2.3_. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the
product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit
of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties
are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section
8.15_ without notice or liability to any other person. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties
hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the
knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Accordingly, persons other than the
parties hereto may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this
Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the
date of this Agreement or as of any other date.

Section 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all actions, proceedings or
counterclaims (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the
Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
thereof, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of laws
provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

Section 8.9 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
for which monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate
remedy, would occur in the event that the parties hereto do not perform the
provisions of this Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are
required of it hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its
specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity
in any such event and prior to the valid exercise of any termination right by
the parties in accordance with _Section 7.1_. Each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that any other party has an adequate
remedy at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or in equity. Any party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall

 



\- 53 -  not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any
such Order or injunction. If Parent has received the Termination Fee, Parent
shall not be entitled to exercise any remedies under this _Section 8.9_.

Section 8.10 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 

(a) Each of Parent, Acquisition Sub and the Company hereby irrevocably submits
to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal and state courts of the State of
Delaware for the purpose of any action, proceeding or counterclaim (whether
based on contract, tort or otherwise) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the actions of Parent, Acquisition Sub or the Company in
the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement thereof, and
each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims in
respect to such action or proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively
in any Delaware state or federal court.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) irrevocably consents to the service of the
summons and complaint and any other process in any other action or proceeding
relating to the Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by personal
delivery of copies of such process to such party and nothing in this _Section
8.10_ shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other
manner permitted by Law, (ii) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any other court of the
State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of this Agreement or
the Transactions, (iii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, and (iv) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions in any court other than the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, if (but only if) the Delaware Court of Chancery shall be
unavailable, any other court of the State of Delaware). Each of Parent,
Acquisition Sub and the Company agrees that a final judgment in any action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

 

Section 8.11 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by

(a) there shall have not been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior
to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of Company Common Stock
(excluding shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to guaranteed
delivery procedures that have not yet been delivered in settlement or

Common Stock owned by Parent and its subsidiaries, would represent at least a
majority of the shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on a fully diluted
basis as of the expiration of the Offer (the "Minimum Tender Condition");

 

(b) (i) any applicable waiting period (or any extension thereof) under the HSR
Act relating to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer or the consummation of the Merger shall not have expired or
otherwise been terminated and (ii) the affirmative approval or clearance
required under Antitrust Laws of Governmental Authorities listed on  _Section
3.5_ of the Company Disclosure Letter relating to the purchase of shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
shall not have been obtained or is deemed not to have been obtained as
a result of the lapse of any applicable waiting period (or any extension
thereof) or as a result of jurisdiction having been declined;

(c) written confirmation by CFIUS shall not have been obtained that it has
completed its review (or, if applicable) investigation) under Exon-Florio and
determined that there are no unresolved national security concerns with
respect thereto; or

 

(d) any of the following conditions shall have occurred and be continuing as
of the expiration of the Offer:

 

(i) a Governmental Authority shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced
or entered any Law or Order which is then in effect and has the effect of
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the making of the Offer or the consummation
of the Offer or the Merger (excluding any antitrust, competition, fair trade
or similar Law or Order which arises outside the United States);

 

(ii) (A) any of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
_Section 3.3(a)_ (Capitalization) shall not be true and correct in all
respects, except for _de minimis_ inaccuracies, as of the expiration of the
Offer with the same force and effect as if made as of the expiration of the
Offer (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which
case as of such earlier date), (B) any of the representations and warranties
of the Company contained in _Section 3.4_ (Authority Relative to Agreement),
_Section 3.26_ (Takeover Statutes), _Section 3.27_ (Vote Required) or
_Section 3.28_ (Brokers), shall not be true and correct in all respects at
and as of the expiration of the Offer with the same force and effect as if
made as of the expiration of the Offer (except to the extent expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date) and (C) any of
the other representations and warranties of the Company contained in this
Agreement (without giving effect to any materiality or "Company Material
Adverse Effect" qualifications therein), shall not be true and correct as of
the Expiration Date with the same force and effect as if made as of the
expiration of the Offer (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier
date, in which case as of such date), except for such failures to be true and
correct as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



Annex I- 1 (iii) the Company shall have failed to perform or comply in all material
respects with each of its obligations required to be performed or complied
with by it under this Agreement;

(iv) since the date of this Agreement, there shall have occurred any change,
event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect; or

 

(v) this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms.

 

Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent a certificate,
signed on behalf of the Company by its chief executive officer, certifying
that none of the conditions set forth in clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of
paragraph (d) above shall have occurred and be continuing as of the expiration
of the Offer.

 

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Acquisition Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer
pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

The foregoing conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are for
the sole benefit of Parent and Acquisition Sub and, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and applicable Law, may be waived by Parent and
Acquisition Sub, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time
in their sole discretion (other than the Minimum Tender Condition). The
failure by Parent or Acquisition Sub at any time to exercise any of the
foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and
from time to time.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We refer to []1.

The Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger
Agreement") with Atlas Management, Inc. and Dublin Acquisition Sub Inc., a
wholly owned subsidiary of Atlas Management, Inc. The Board of Directors of
the Company (the "Board") has approved the Company waiving any "standstill"
provisions applicable to [Third Party] for the sole purpose of entertaining
any interest [Third Party] may have in a possible Transaction (as defined
below). In accordance with the requirements of  _Section 5.6_ of the Merger
Agreement [and the []], we hereby notify you that the Board has approved (i)
[Third Party] (or an affiliate) making an offer [language to be tailored to
the standstill obligation] (a "Transaction") whereby [Third Party] would
acquire the Company. For the avoidance of doubt, the Company does not waive or
agree to the approval under the [] of any other proposals, offers, public
statements, stock purchases made by [Third Party] to the Company (or the
Companys shareholders, the Board or any special committee thereof that may
be designated by the Board) other than as outlined above.

The waiver contained in this notice shall terminate upon the earliest to occur
of (1) the termination of the Merger Agreement, (2) the Offer Closing (as
such term is defined in the Merger Agreement) and (3) the withdrawal of the
waiver contained in this notice by the Board by notice to [Third Party]
(provided that any such withdrawal by the Board shall not have a retroactive
effect).
