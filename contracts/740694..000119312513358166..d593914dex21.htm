representations, warranties and covenants, which were made for the purposes of such agreement and as of specific dates, were made solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement and may be intended not as statements of fact, but rather
as a way of allocating risk to one of the parties if those statements prove to be inaccurate. In addition, such representations, warranties and covenants may be subject to important qualifications and limitations agreed to by the Company, Parent and
Acquisition Sub in connection with the negotiated terms or with certain disclosures not reflected in the text of the Merger Agreement, may not be accurate or complete as of any specified date or may be subject to a contractual standard of
materiality different from those generally applicable to stockholders or other investors in the Company. The Company&#146;s stockholders and other investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the
representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or conditions of the Company, Parent, Acquisition Sub or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. </P>
