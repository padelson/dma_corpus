ARTICLE I 
  
  _THE MERGER_

 

_ 
  _

   

1.1 _The Merger_.

 


 

   

(a) _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the  DGCL,
at the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall cause Merger Sub to be merged with
and into the Company, whereupon the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
will cease and the Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the 
Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and as a wholly owned subsidiary of
Buyer. At the Closing, Buyer and the Company shall cause the Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger in customary form and substance
(the " _Certificate      of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware pursuant to Section 251 of the DGCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is accepted by the
Delaware Secretary of State or at such  later time as Buyer and the Company
mutually agree in writing and as set forth in the Certificate of Merger (such
date and time as the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

 


 

   

(b) _The Surviving Corporation_.

 


 

   

(i) _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_.

 


 

   

(A) _Certificate of Incorporation_. Unless otherwise determined by Buyer prior
to the Effective Time, the certificate of  incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be
identical to the certificate of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended  in
accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such certificate of
incorporation; provided, however, that at the Effective Time, Article I of the
certificate of incorporation of the Surviving  Corporation shall be amended
and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name of the corporation
is Shape Security, Inc."

 


 

   

(B) _Bylaws_. Unless otherwise determined by Buyer prior to the Effective
Time, the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately  prior to the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation as of the
Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as
provided in the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
and  such bylaws.

 


 

 

 

2    

(ii) _Directors and Officers_.

 


 

   

(A) _Directors_. Unless otherwise determined by Buyer prior to the Effective
Time, the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to  the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold the office of a director of the Surviving
Corporation in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law and the 
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until his
or her successors is duly elected and qualified.

 


 

   

(B) _Officers_. Unless otherwise determined by Buyer prior to the Effective
Time, the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to  the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the
Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the provisions of the
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

   

1.2 _General Effects of Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effects of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the Certificate of Merger 
and the applicable provisions of DGCL (including Section 259(a)). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed to pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, all of the  assets (including property), rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of a public and private nature of the Company and Merger
Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Company and Merger Sub  shall become the debts, liabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 


 

   

1.3 _Effects of Merger on Securities of Merging Corporations_.

 


 

   

(a) _Merger Sub Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the 
Company Securityholders or any other Person, each share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into one validly
issued, fully  paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each share certificate of Merger Sub
evidencing ownership of any such shares shall thereupon evidence ownership
only of such shares of the  Surviving Corporation.

 


 

   

(b) _Company_ _Shares_.

 


 

   

(i) _Generally_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without

otherwise required by an order, decree, ruling or injunction of a court of

Option  shall be exercisable for that number of whole shares of Buyer Common
Stock equal to the product of the number of Company Common Shares that were
issuable upon exercise of such Unvested Company Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, with the result rounded
down to the nearest whole number of shares of Buyer Common Stock and (y) the
per share exercise price for the shares of Buyer Common Stock issuable  upon

to the nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the exercise price of the Buyer Option, the number of shares purchasable

which Section 421 of the Code applies by reason of its  qualification under
Section 422 of the Code, Section 424 of the Code.

customary confidentiality and indemnity agreements, provide the Accounting
Firm  with access to their respective books, records, personnel and

determination (such determination to include a worksheet setting forth all
material calculations used in arriving at such determination and to be based
solely on information provided to the Accounting  Firm by Buyer and the
Securityholder Representative) of the disputed items within thirty (30)
calendar days of receipt of the disputed items, which determination shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto and not subject to appeal. All  fees
and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Accounting
Firm will be allocated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, first out of the
Expense  Fund, and only after the Expense Fund is exhausted, then from the
Indemnifying Parties directly), on the other hand, in the same proportion that
the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the Accounting Firm
that is  unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally determined by
the Accounting Firm) bears to the total disputed amount of such items so
submitted.

calculated based on Total Closing Consideration Adjustment Amount as deemed 
final and binding on the parties hereto pursuant to this _Section 1.4_ , is

to each Company Shareholder that has not already returned to the Payment Agent
a Letter of Transmittal distributed by the Company, at the address or email
address  set forth opposite each such Person's name on the Closing Payment

Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith (the " _Exchange
Documents_ "), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, Buyer shall cause the Payment Agent to pay to the holder
of  such Company Shares in exchange therefor the Total Closing Consideration
payable in respect thereto pursuant to _Section 1.3_. No portion of the Total

Time, the consideration payable to such Person pursuant to _Section 1.3_ shall
be reduced by an amount equal to the outstanding principal plus accrued
interest, if any, of such Person's  loans as of the Effective Time, plus any
other amounts owed by such Person to the Company or any Subsidiary
(collectively, such Person's " _Loan Repayment Amount_ "). Such loans shall be
satisfied as  to the amount by which the consideration is reduced pursuant to
this _Section 2.3(c)(iii)._ To the extent the consideration payable to such
Person is so reduced, such amount shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having  been paid to such Person.

 


 

   

(iv) The cash amounts paid in respect of the cancellation of Company Shares in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed  to be full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Shares, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving
Corporation of Company Shares which were outstanding immediately prior to
the  Effective Time.

 


 

   

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 2.3_, none of
Buyer, the Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation, nor  any party hereto

Payment Spreadsheet, Buyer  shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the
Payment Fund held by the Payment Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an amount in cash equal to the Positive Adjustment Amount, if

Adjustment Amount pursuant to _Section 2.4(b)(i)_, Buyer  shall deliver or

effectuate all applicable Tax withholding obligations on such payments.

extent permitted by applicable Law, shall be treated for all Tax  purposes as
an adjustment to the Total Closing Consideration.

Buyer and the Surviving Corporation and their agents and Affiliates (each, 
as applicable, a " _Withholding Agent_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from any amounts payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this
Agreement any amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under any
provision of  federal, local or foreign Tax law or under any Laws or Orders;
provided, however, that Buyer will give the Company, with respect to payments
made on or about  the Closing, or the Securityholder Representative, with
respect to payments made after the Closing, written notice at least three (3)
Business Days prior to any such withholding that is not specified in a Payment
Spreadsheet (such notice to  include reasonable detail and the authority and
method of calculation for the proposed deduction or withholding) and (a) Buyer
and/or the applicable Withholding Agent shall consider in good faith any claim
by the Company or the Securityholder  Representative, as applicable, that
such withholding is not required or should be imposed at a reduced rate and
(b) Buyer and/or the applicable Withholding Agent shall cooperate with the
Company or the Securityholder Representative, as  applicable, in good faith
to minimize, to the extent permissible under applicable Law, the amount of any
such deduction or withholding, the submission of any certificates or forms to
establish an exemption from, reduction in, or refund of any  such deduction
or withholding. Upon reasonable request by the applicable Withholding Agent,
any Person entitled to receive payments pursuant to this Agreement shall
provide any necessary Tax forms, including a valid IRS Form W-9 or the 
appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as applicable, and any similar
information, including any information for U.S. federal, state or local or
non-U.S. Tax purposes. Any amounts so deducted or withheld shall be timely
paid to the appropriate  Governmental Entity and to the extent such amounts
are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts
would otherwise have been paid. To the  extent that any payment to any Person
is not reduced by such deductions or withholdings, such Person shall indemnify
Buyer and its Affiliates (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation) for any amounts imposed by and paid  over to a Governmental
Entity with respect to any such Taxes, together with any costs and expenses
relating thereto (including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs of
investigation) except for any such Taxes, costs or expenses resulting from 
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Buyer or its Affiliates
(including the Surviving Corporation).

is expressly acknowledged and agreed that Buyer, the Payment Agent and their
respective  Affiliates and Representatives shall be entitled to rely on the

any Person (including Buyer, the Company, the Payment  Agent and their
respective Affiliates and Representatives) in accordance with the Pre-Closing

fact that Buyer may provide comments or request changes to any  draft Pre-
Closing Statement, draft Payment Spreadsheets or that Buyer and the Company
may agree to changes to the information or amounts on the Pre-Closing

(the " _Lease Agreements_ "). The Company or any Subsidiary currently occupies
all of the Leased Real Property for the  operation of its business. There are
no other parties occupying, or with a right to occupy, the Leased Real
Property. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary owes brokerage commissions or
finders' fees with respect to any such Leased Real  Property or would owe any
such fees if any existing Lease Agreement were renewed pursuant to any renewal
options contained in such Lease Agreements. The Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has performed all of its obligations under any  termination
agreements pursuant to which it has terminated any leases, subleases, licenses

condition and repair, free from structural, physical and mechanical defects,

respect to  similar properties, and is structurally sufficient and otherwise
suitable for the conduct of the Company's business. Neither the operation of
the Company or any Subsidiary on the Leased Real Property nor, to the
Company's Knowledge, such Leased  Real Property, including the improvements

not dependent on so-called non-conforming use  exceptions.

Liens, except (a) as reflected in the Current Balance Sheet, and (b) 
Permitted Liens. The tangible properties and tangible assets owned or leased

independent contractor of the Company or any  Subsidiary and who is or was
involved in the creation or development of any Company IP (including any

such Company IP without the exclusion or reservation by the Contributor of any
Intellectual Property or  Intellectual Property Right;

 


 

 

 

35    

(ii) no Contributor or, to the Knowledge of the Company, former employer of
any Contributor has any claim, right or  interest to or in any Company IP;

 


 

   

(iii) to the Knowledge of the Company, no Contributor is in breach of any
Contract with any former employer or other  Person concerning Intellectual
Property Rights or confidentiality that, as a result of such breach, would
affect the Company's or any Subsidiary's right or interest in or to any
Company IP;

 


 

   

(iv) no funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Entity or of any
university, college, other educational  institution, or any multi-national,
bi-national or international organization or research center were used to
develop or create any Company IP;

 


 

   

(v) the Company and each Subsidiary has taken reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of all proprietary  information held by such entity, or
purported to be held by such entity, as a Trade Secret, and has applied
appropriate access levels to Trade Secrets to personnel based on a need to
have access basis, including any such information of a third  party provided
to the Company or any Subsidiary with obligations of confidentiality;

 


 

   

(vi) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has permitted the rights of the
Company or any Subsidiary in any Company  IP to enter into the public domain;

 


 

   

(vii) no Company IP is subject to any proceeding or outstanding decree, order,
judgment or settlement agreement, or  stipulation that restricts in any
manner the use, exploitation, transfer or Licensing thereof by the Company or
any Subsidiary; 
  
 

   

(viii) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has assigned or otherwise
transferred ownership of or granted an exclusive  License to, or agreed to
assign or otherwise transfer ownership of or grant an exclusive License to,
any (A) Patents or (B) any Intellectual Property Right (other than Patents)
that is or was (at the time of such assignment or transfer of  ownership or
the granting of such exclusive License) material to the business of the
Company or any Subsidiary, to any other Person;

 


 

   

(ix) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is currently or has been a member
or promoter of, or a Contributor to, any  industry standards body or similar
organization that could require or obligate the Company or any Subsidiary to
grant or offer to any other Person any License or right to any Company IP (or
that could, following the Effective Time, require or  obligate Buyer or any
of its Affiliates to grant or offer to any other Person any License or right
to any Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Right);

 


 

   

(x) none of the Patents included in the Company IP are subject to any
declaration that obligates the Company or any  of the Subsidiaries to grant a
License thereunder on a royalty-free basis or on reasonable and non-
discriminatory (RAND) or fair reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms;
and

 


 

   

(xi) the Company and each Subsidiary owns or otherwise has, and after the
Closing will continue to have, all  Intellectual Property Rights and
Intellectual Property needed to conduct the business of such entity as

at the appropriate Governmental Entity as the sole  owner of all Company
Registered IP (excluding Company Registered IP that is exclusively Licensed to
the Company or one of the Subsidiaries) and there are no gaps in chain-of-
title documents filed with the applicable Governmental Entity with  respect
thereto. All necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees with respect
to the Company Registered IP have been paid, and all necessary affidavits,
responses, recordations, certificates, releases and other documents have
been  filed, in each case for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining,
perfecting, preserving and renewing all such Company Registered IP and the
ownership rights of the Company or one of the Subsidiaries with respect
thereto. To the Knowledge of the  Company, there is no basis for a claim that
any Company Registered IP, except for pending applications, is invalid or
unenforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no Trademark
(whether registered or unregistered) or domain  name that is Company IP is
confusingly similar to or otherwise violates any Trademark (whether registered
or unregistered) or domain name owned, used or applied for by any third party.
None of the goodwill associated with or inherent in any  Trademark (whether
registered or unregistered) in which the Company or any Subsidiary has or
purports to have an ownership interest has been impaired.

 


 

   

(e) _Effects of This Transaction_. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any Related Agreements,  nor the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any
Related Agreement will, with or without notice or the lapse of time, result in
or give any other Person the right or option to cause or declare: (i) a loss

restriction on the operation or scope  of their respective businesses; (iv)
the release, disclosure or delivery of any Company IP by or to any escrow
agent or other Person; (v) the Company or any Subsidiary becoming obligated to

of the Subsidiaries in the absence of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; or (vi) the grant, assignment or transfer to  any other
Person of any License under any of the Company IP or, pursuant to the terms of
any Company IP Contract, under any Intellectual Property or Intellectual
Property Rights of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Neither the Company nor
any  Subsidiary has claimed any status in the application for or registration
of any Company Registered IP, including "small business status," that would be
invalid or inaccurate following the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement or any Related Agreement.

 


 

   

(f) _No Third-Party Infringement of Company IP_. To the Knowledge of the
Company, no third party has Infringed, and no third  party is currently
Infringing, any Company IP. _Section 3.13(f)_ of the Disclosure Schedule
accurately identifies (and the Company has Made Available a true, correct and
complete copy of) each letter or other written or electronic  communication
or correspondence that has been sent or otherwise delivered by or to the
Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective representatives regarding
any actual, alleged or suspected Infringement of any Company IP.

obtained by the Company and the Subsidiaries with respect to any of the
foregoing activities that have not been obtained. To the Knowledge of the
Company, the Company and the Subsidiaries have valid written licenses  to
use, reproduce, incorporate, distribute, license, sublicense and provide
access to customers in respect of all Licensed IP to the extent needed to
commercialize any Development Product and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
consents are  required to be obtained by the Company and the Subsidiaries
with respect to any of the foregoing activities that have not been obtained.
The Licensed IP Contracts provide the Company and the Subsidiaries with the
right, with respect to any  Licensed IP, to (i) distribute and make available
Company Products to their customers and potential customers in the manner the
Company or any Subsidiary currently makes Company Products available and (ii)
authorize their customers and  potential customers to use such Company
Products in the manner authorized by the Company and the Subsidiaries. No
third party that has Licensed any Licensed IP to the Company or any Subsidiary
that is used by the Company or any Subsidiary in  the production environment
for any Company Product or that is otherwise necessary to the operation of any
Company Product has retained or been assigned an ownership interest in or any
exclusive License to any Intellectual Property or  Intellectual Property
Rights in any improvements, modifications or derivative works to such Licensed
IP made solely or jointly by the Company or any Subsidiary.

 


 

   

(h) _No Infringement of Third-Party IP Rights_. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary is Infringing, or has ever Infringed,  misappropriated or
otherwise violated, any Intellectual Property Right of any other Person. The
conduct of the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries has not
Infringed any Intellectual Property Right of any other Person and, to the 
Knowledge of the Company, there is no reasonable basis for any such claim.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) no Company Product has
ever Infringed any Intellectual Property Right of any third party; (ii) no
Infringement,  misappropriation or similar Action, or any Action alleging
unfair competition or trade practices, is pending or has been threatened in
writing (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, by any non-written means of
communication) against the Company  or any Subsidiary or against any other
Person who may be entitled to be indemnified, defended, held harmless or
reimbursed by the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to such Action; (iii)
neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received  any written notice or
other written communication (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any non-
written notice or other non-written communication) relating to any actual,
alleged or suspected Infringement by the Company or any Subsidiary of any 
Intellectual Property Right of any third party, or any actual, alleged or
suspected engagement by the Company or any Subsidiary in unfair competition or
trade practices under the Laws of any jurisdiction; and (iv) neither the
Company nor any  Subsidiary is bound by any Contract to indemnify, defend,
hold harmless or reimburse any other Person with respect to any Infringement
of any Intellectual Property Right (other than as set forth in _Section
3.13(h)_ of the Disclosure  Schedule or in any Standard Form IP Contract).
Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever sought or obtained an opinion
of counsel regarding any possible Infringement of any third party's
Intellectual Property Rights.

 


 

 

 

38    

(i) _Bugs_. None of the Company Technology fails to materially comply with any
applicable warranty or other contractual  commitment made by or on behalf of
the Company or any Subsidiary relating to the use, functionality or
performance of, or any product or system containing or used in conjunction
with, such Company Technology. The Company has Made Available a  true,

(j) _No Contaminants_. None of the Company Technology that is Company IP (and,
to the Knowledge of the Company, none of the  Company Technology that is
Licensed IP) contains any Contaminants. The Company and each Subsidiary uses
industry standard measures, which measures are no less than reasonable, to
prevent the introduction of Contaminants into Company Technology.

 


 

   

(k) _Use of Open Source Code_.

 


 

   

(i) On October 28, 2019, the Company provided a complete and accurate copy to
Flexera Software LLC (" _Flexera_ ")      for Flexera's review, of the
most recent version of all Software that forms a part of the current version
of each Launched Product.

 


 

   

(ii) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has used, modified, or distributed
any Open Source Software in a manner  that, based on the conduct of the
businesses of the Company and each Subsidiary as currently conducted: (A)
requires the disclosure, Licensing or distribution of any source code for any
Company IP; (B) imposes any restriction on the  consideration to be charged
for the distribution of any Company IP; (C) creates, or purports to create,
obligations for the Company or any Subsidiary with respect to the Company IP
other than those set forth in the applicable Open Source  License, or grants,
or purports to grant, to any third party, any rights or immunities under any

Open Source Software.

 


 

   

(l) _Company Source Code_. The Company and each Subsidiary has taken actions
customary in the software industry to document the  Software that is Company
IP and its operation, such that such Software, including its source code and
documentation, have been written in a professional manner so that they may be
understood, modified and maintained in an efficient manner by  reasonably
competent programmers. No source code for any Company IP has been delivered,
Licensed or made available to any escrow agent or other Person who was not, as
of the time thereof, an Employee or contractor of the Company or any 
Subsidiary, including under any Open Source License. Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has any duty or obligation (whether present, contingent or
otherwise) to deliver, License or make available the source code for any
Company IP to any  escrow agent or other Person. No event has occurred, and
no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse of
time) will, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the delivery,
License or disclosure of any source  code for any Company IP to any other
Person who is not, as of the Agreement Date, an Employee or contractor of the
Company or any Subsidiary. _Section 3.13(l)_ of the Disclosure Schedule sets
forth a complete and accurate list of each  contractor that has invented,
conceived or developed any Company IP or had access to the source code of the
Company or any Subsidiary.

the Subsidiaries' databases and other information relating to its customers
and all non-customer end users of the Company Sites and the Company Products
or to other individuals whose  Private Data is Processed by a Company
Product, including all Private Data, from the Company or the Subsidiaries to
the Surviving Corporation will cause, constitute, or result in a breach or
violation of any Privacy Obligation by any party to  this Agreement (or any
of their Affiliates), or cause, constitute, or result in a violation of any
representations with regard to Private Data made by Company or any Subsidiary,
including any Company Privacy Policy. Copies of all Company  Privacy Policies
have been Made Available. Company Privacy Policies have at all times made all
disclosures to users or customers required by all Privacy Obligations, and

Washington. Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.

 


 

   

4.2 _Authority and Enforceability_.

 


 

   

(a) Each of Buyer and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into this Agreement and any Related  Agreements to which
it is a party and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery by each of Buyer
and Merger Sub of this Agreement and any Related Agreements to which it is a 
party and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate and other action on the part of Buyer and Merger Sub.

 


 

 

 

53    

(b) This Agreement and any Related Agreements to which Buyer and Merger Sub
are parties have been duly executed and delivered by Buyer  and Merger Sub
and constitute the valid and binding obligations of Buyer and Merger Sub,
enforceable against each of Buyer and Merger Sub in accordance with their
terms, subject to (a) Laws of general application relating to bankruptcy, 
insolvency, moratorium, the relief of debtors and enforcement of creditors'
rights in general, and (b) rules of law governing specific performance,
injunctive relief, other equitable remedies and other general principles of
equity.

   


 

 

(c) The Buyer Common Stock subject to Unvested Company Options assumed by
Buyer when issued pursuant to and in accordance with the  terms hereof, will
be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.

   


 

 

4.3 _Governmental Approvals_. No consent, waiver, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing  with, any
Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to Buyer or Merger Sub in
connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any Related

the  Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,
except for the HSR Filing and any required filing under non-U.S. antitrust,
competition, or merger control laws.

   


 

 

4.4 _Financing_. Buyer has delivered to the Company a true and correct copy of
an executed debt commitment letter (the " _Commitment      Letter_ ")
pursuant to which the lenders named therein (the " _Lenders_ ") have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to lend
Buyer the amounts set forth therein (the " _Financing_ ") for the purpose of 
funding the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer has also
delivered to the Company a true and complete (other than the redactions
referenced herein) copy of any fee letter related to the Commitment Letter (it
being understood that  any such fee letter provided to the Company shall be
redacted in a customary manner solely with respect to the fees, pricing caps
and certain economic terms (including economic flex terms), which redacted
information does not adversely affect  the amount, availability or
conditionality of the funding of the Financing) (any such fee letter, a " _Fee
Letter_ "). As of the Agreement Date, the Commitment Letter and the Fee
Letters (i) are in full force and effect and (ii) have not  been withdrawn or
terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect and, as of the
Agreement, to the knowledge of Buyer, no such withdrawal, termination or
amendment is contemplated. As of the Agreement Date, each Fee Letter and the 
Commitment Letter is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Buyer and, to
the knowledge of Buyer, the other parties thereto, except as enforcement may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting
creditors'  rights generally and by general principles of equity. As of the
Agreement Date, there are no other agreements or side letters relating to the
Commitment Letter or Fee Letters to which Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party that would  affect the availability of the Financing (other than the
Commitment Letter and the Fee Letters). As of the Agreement Date, no event has
occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default or breach on the  part of Buyer under any term or
condition of the Commitment Letter or Fee Letters. There are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the  Commitment Letter.
Buyer has (or has caused to be) fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Commitment Letter or Fee Letters to be paid by it
on or prior to the Agreement Date. As of the Agreement Date, assuming the

the performance by the Company of its obligations under _Article VII_ and the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ and
_Section      2.2(b)_ , Buyer is not aware of any fact or occurrence
that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be
expected to (i) result in any of the conditions in the Commitment Letter not
being satisfied, or (ii) otherwise  result in the Financing not being
available on a timely basis in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The net proceeds from the Financing, together
with cash on hand of Buyer and its Subsidiaries, will be  sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer confirms
that it is not a condition to Closing or any of its other obligations under
this Agreement that Buyer obtain financing for or in connection with the 
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

   


 

 

 

54  

4.5 _Non-Reliance_. Except as expressly set forth in _Article IV_ of this

of the Company or any of its Representatives, whether written or oral, express
or  implied other than the representations and warranties set forth in
_Article III_. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement but subject to the immediately following sentence,
nothing set forth  in this _Section 4.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement will
limit, restrict, impair or otherwise effect, operate as a release of, or be
used in any way as a defense against, any rights, remedies or recourse
available to Buyer or Merger Sub  or any of their respective Representatives
under applicable Law in the event of fraud arising in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether based on this Agreement
or otherwise). Notwithstanding the foregoing or  anything to the contrary set
forth in this Agreement, Buyer and Merger Sub understand and hereby
acknowledge and agree that neither Buyer or Merger Sub nor any of their
respective Representatives shall have any right to bring (and hereby 
expressly waives to the fullest extent allowable under applicable Law the
right to file, bring or make) any indemnification claim pursuant to _Article
IX_ , or any lawsuit or other claims against the Company or any of its
stockholders,  Affiliates or Representatives under this Agreement or
otherwise arising out of any financial projections or forecasts provided by
the Company or its Representatives in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.

   


 

   

4.6 _Solvency_. Immediately after giving effect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated this Agreement, including  any debt financing being
entered into in connection therewith), including the consummation of the
Financing and the satisfaction of Buyer's obligations under _Section 2.3(b)_ ,
and assuming that the representations and warranties of the  Company and its
Subsidiaries set forth herein are true and correct in all material respects as
of the Closing, Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including Merger Sub), taken as a
whole, shall be Solvent. For the purpose of this _Section 4.6_ ,  the term "

Person on its existing debts (including contingent liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and matured; (ii) such Person shall not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably  small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses
in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following such date; and
(iii) such Person shall be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent
and other liabilities, as they  mature. For the purpose of this definition,
"not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its liabilities, including contingent and  other liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person shall be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancing, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due. No transfer of property  is being made by
Buyer or Merger Sub, and no obligation is being incurred by Buyer or Merger
Sub, in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with
the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors  of
Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries.

ARTICLE VII 
  
  _ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

  _

   

7.1 _Shareholder Approvals_.

 


 

   

(a) _Requisite Shareholder Approval_. Within three (3) hours of the execution
of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to  Buyer the Shareholder
Consent from Company Shareholders that are sufficient to fully and irrevocably
deliver the Requisite Shareholder Approval. Promptly, and in any event within

Company shall solicit Shareholder Consents from all of its remaining Company
Shareholders by delivery of an Information Statement (the " _Information
Statement_ "). The Company shall promptly deliver to Buyer a copy of each 
executed Shareholder Consent upon receipt thereof from any Company Shareholder
pursuant to such solicitation. Following receipt of the Requisite Shareholder
Approval, the Company shall promptly deliver notice to each Company
Shareholder whose  consent was not obtained prior to the Company's receipt of
the Requisite Shareholder Approval, which notice shall include the notice to
shareholders required by the Certificate of Incorporation and the DGCL of the
approval of the Merger. The  Company shall (i) give the Buyer a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on all materials to be submitted to the
Company Shareholders, including the Information Statement, and (ii) consider
in good faith, and incorporate therein, all  comments reasonably proposed by
Buyer. The board of directors of the Company shall not alter, modify, change
or revoke its unanimous approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, nor its unanimous  recommendation to the
Company Shareholders to vote in favor of adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

   

(b) _280G Approvals_. The Company shall solicit (and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain) a written 280G waiver,  each in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer (the " _280G Waiver_ "), from each
"disqualified individual" (within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) who
otherwise would reasonably be expected to receive any payments and/or benefits
in  connection with the Merger that may constitute "parachute payments"
(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code) (collectively, the " _280G
Persons_ "). The Company, prior to the Effective Time, shall submit to the
Company Shareholders  for approval (in a form and manner reasonably
satisfactory to Buyer), by such number of Company Shareholders as is required
by the terms of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, any payments and/or
benefits to be paid or provided to any  "disqualified individual" that
previously executed a 280G Waiver that may separately or in the aggregate,
constitute "parachute payments" (which determination shall be made by the
Company and shall be subject to reasonable review and approval  (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) by
Buyer), such that such payments and benefits shall not be deemed to be
"parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code. Prior to the Effective
Time the Company  shall deliver to Buyer evidence reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer that (i) a Company Shareholder vote was solicited in conformance with
Section 280G and the regulations promulgated thereunder and the requisite
Company Shareholders approval was  obtained with respect to any payments
and/or benefits that were subject to the Company Shareholder vote (the " _280G
Approval_ "), or (ii) that the 280G Approval was not obtained and as a
consequence, that any such "parachute payments"  pursuant to which a 280G
Waiver was executed shall not be made or provided, pursuant to such 280G
Waiver. The form and substance of all Company Shareholder approval documents
contemplated by this _Section 7.1(b)_ , including the 280G  Waivers, shall be
submitted to Buyer at least three (3) days before submission to the
disqualified individuals or stockholders, as applicable, for review and

Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice a Notification and Report Form relating to the Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby as required by the HSR Act  within
ten (10) Business Days of the Agreement Date (the " _HSR Filing_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall be responsible for making, with the
Company's reasonable assistance, all filings or notifications as may be
required under  non-U.S. antitrust, competition, or merger control laws. Each
of the Company and Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain all
such authorizations, approvals and consents. To the extent permitted by
applicable Laws, each of the  Company and Buyer shall promptly inform the
other of any substantive communication between the Company or Buyer (as
applicable) and any Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated hereby. If the Company or Buyer or any Affiliate  thereof shall
receive any formal or informal request for supplemental information or
documentary material from any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, then the Company or Buyer (as applicable)
shall make,  or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable, a
reasonable response in compliance with such request, and shall consider in
good faith the views of the other in the making of such response. Without
limiting the generality of the  foregoing, each party shall provide to the
other (or the other's respective advisors) upon request copies of all
correspondence between such party and any Governmental Entity relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, provided  that the parties may,
as they deem advisable and necessary, designate any competitively sensitive
materials provided to the other under this _Section 7.2_ as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein  shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the party providing such materials. In 
addition, to the extent reasonably practicable, all discussions, telephone
calls, and meetings with a Governmental Entity regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall include representatives of all parties.
Subject to  applicable Law, the parties will consult and cooperate with each
other in connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda,
briefs, arguments, and proposals made or submitted to any Governmental Entity

any party.

 


 

   

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth in

of  Buyer shall be required to agree to any license, sale or other
disposition or holding separate (through the establishment of a trust or
otherwise), of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property
of Buyer, the Company or any  of their respective Affiliates, or the
imposition of any limitation or restriction on the ability of any of them to

waivers of any Governmental Entity as contemplated hereby, and the Company and
its Subsidiaries will take such actions as reasonably requested by Buyer in
connection with obtaining such consents, approvals or waivers. Notwithstanding
Buyer's  rights to lead all proceedings as provided in the prior sentence,
Buyer shall not require the Company to, and the Company shall not be required
to, take any action with respect to any applicable antitrust or anti-
competition Law which would  bind the Company or its Subsidiaries
irrespective of whether the Merger occurs.

efforts to obtain all necessary consents, waivers and  approvals of any third
parties to any Material Contract (including all of the Contracts set forth in
_Section 2.3_ of the Disclosure Schedule) and any other Contract of the
Company or its Subsidiaries as may be identified by Buyer, in  each case as
are required thereunder in connection with the Merger in order for such
Contract to remain in full force and effect following the Merger, with the
understanding that the Company shall not be required to pay any consent fee
or  similar payment or agree to any accommodation in each case to the extent
not required pursuant to the express terms of such Material Contract or other
Contract. Such consents, modifications, waivers and approvals shall be in a
form reasonably  acceptable to Buyer. In the event the Merger does not close
for any reason, neither Buyer nor Merger Sub shall have any liability to the
Company, the Company Securityholders or any other Person for any costs,
claims, Liabilities or damages  resulting from the Company seeking to obtain

consents, approvals and other documents required to be delivered hereunder and
to effect all necessary  registrations and filings and to remove any
injunctions or other impediments or delays, legal or otherwise, in each case
in order to consummate and make effective the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by or before  the End Date for
the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits contemplated by
this Agreement.

reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, pursuant to which such  Specified IP
Contributor irrevocably assigns to the Company all Intellectual Property

terminated pursuant to resolutions of the board of directors (or similar body)
of the Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be. The form and  substance
of such resolutions shall be subject to reasonable review and approval of
Buyer (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). In the event the Company 401(k) Plan is terminated, the Company and
Buyer  shall take any and all actions as may be required, including
amendments to the 401(k) Plan or Buyer's applicable 401(k) plan (the " _Buyer
401(k) Plan_ "), to (i) provide that Continuing Employees (except for any PEO
Employee for so long as  such Employee remains employed by a PEO following
the Closing) shall be eligible to participate in the Buyer 401(k) Plan,
effective as soon as practicable following the Effective Time, and (ii) permit
the Continuing Employees (except for any  PEO Employee for so long as such
Employee remains employed by a PEO following the Closing) who are then

cash bonus opportunity (if applicable) than those currently provided by the
Company immediately prior to the Closing substantially similar to the form

become effective immediately following the Closing. The Company and its
Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall cooperate with and provide reasonable
assistance to Buyer in  preparing and delivering the Offer Letters to the
Other Employees and ensuring the continuation of services of the PEO
Employees.

employment of the Continuing Employees  pursuant to Offer Letters, such
Continuing Employees (other than any PEO Employee for so long as such Employee
remains employed by a PEO following the Closing) shall be eligible to
participate in Buyer's standard benefit plans and be offered  employee
benefits at least as favorable to such Continuing Employees as that offered to
similarly situated employees of Buyer; provided, however, that Buyer  shall
not be obligated under the terms of this Agreement to cause the continuation
of any employment relationship with any Continuing Employee for any specific
period of time. Each such Continuing Employee who elects to participate in
Buyer's  benefit plans shall, subject to applicable Law and applicable Tax
qualification requirements, be given credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting for his or her years of service with the Company or
any Subsidiary; provided that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to

Program to the Continuing Employees (other than any PEO Employee for so long 
as such Employee remains employed by a PEO), in accordance with Buyer's
standard terms and conditions for similar such grants. Prior to Closing, Buyer
shall discuss in good faith with the Company the allocation of the Retention
Program amounts  to Continuing Employees.

shall be prepared in accordance with applicable Law and in a manner 
consistent with past practices (unless otherwise required by applicable Law).
Any such income or other material Tax Return shall be provided to Buyer for
review and comment a reasonable period prior to filing (which shall be at
least thirty  (30) days with respect to any such Tax Return relating to
income Taxes), and the Company shall consider in good faith reasonable
comments from Buyer and shall not file such Tax Returns without Buyer's prior
written consent (not to be  unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
provided that any dispute between the Company and Buyer with respect to such
Tax Returns shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the 
dispute resolution mechanics described in _Section 1.4(e)_ (to the extent

Taxes), and the Company shall consider in good faith reasonable comments from
the Securityholder  Representative; provided, however, Buyer shall not file
such Tax Returns without the Securityholder Representative's prior written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such Tax
Returns would result in Pre-Closing  Taxes with respect to which the
Indemnified Parties would be entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)(iv)_ ; provided, further, that any dispute between Buyer and the
Securityholder  Representative with respect to such Tax Returns shall be
resolved by the Accounting Firm in accordance with the dispute resolution

whole or in part to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or agree to the
waiver or any extension of the statute of limitations, with respect to  any
Pre-Closing Tax Period, without the prior written consent of the
Securityholder Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless such action is (i) required by
applicable Law or (ii) related  to obtaining an increased tax benefit on
account of any research and development expenditures, including any
adjustments resulting therefrom (e.g. any adjustments or credits resulting
therefrom), which, for the avoidance of doubt, does not  increase Pre-Closing
Taxes; provided that Buyer shall notify the Securityholder Representative no
later than ten (10) days before taking any action pursuant to the foregoing
clause (i) or (ii)).

 


 

   

(d) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. In Buyer's sole discretion, any Tax sharing,

examinations, and any proceedings relating to the  liabilities for Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer and the Company, on the one
hand, and the Securityholder Representative and the Indemnifying Parties, on
the other hand, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent  reasonably
requested by the other party, with each other, including by furnishing or
making available during normal business hours the records, personnel (as
reasonably required), books of account, powers of attorney or other
materials  necessary or helpful for the preparation of such Tax Returns, the
conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims relating to such Taxes

Taxes of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (a " _Tax Contest_ ") with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Pre-Closing Taxes. The
Securityholder  Representative shall have the right to control the conduct,
through counsel of its own choosing, of any such Tax Contest, provided that
(i) it shall give prompt notice to Buyer of its intention to control such Tax
Contest, (ii) it shall provide  periodic updates of the status of such Tax
Contest to Buyer, (iii) Buyer may, at its own expense, participate in (but not
control) such Tax Contest, and (iv) the Securityholder Representative shall
not settle or otherwise resolve any such Tax  Contest without Buyer's written
consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Buyer shall
control the defense of all other Tax Contests. 
  
 

   

(g) _Tax Refunds_.

 


 

   

(i) If after the Closing Date, Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) actually  receives or realizes any refund, or a credit
in lieu of a refund, of any Tax that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or of any Pre-Closing Taxes, and such Tax was paid or deemed paid
(including amounts included in the calculation of  Net Working Capital and
Third-Party Expenses) by (i) the Indemnifying Parties on or after the Closing
Date or (ii) the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date,
then Buyer promptly shall pay or cause to be paid to the  Securityholder
Representative the amount of any such refund or credit (except to the extent
that the right to such refund or credit was treated as a current asset that
increased Net Working Capital), net of any Taxes imposed on Buyer or any of 
its Affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) with respect thereto, and
net of any costs of Buyer or the Surviving Corporation that are reasonably
associated with obtaining such refund or credit (" _Net Tax Refund_ "), but
only if the  aggregate amount of all such Net Tax Refunds exceeds $250,000
(the " _Basket Amount_ "). If the aggregate amount of all such Net Tax Refunds
exceeds the Basket Amount, then the entire amount of such aggregate Net Tax
Refunds shall be paid to  the Payment Agent for distribution to each of the
Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the Tax Refund Payment Spreadsheet.

 


 

   

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days of the Buyer paying a Net Tax Refund to the
Payment Agent, the Securityholder  Representative shall prepare an updated
version of the Closing Payment Spreadsheet (the " _Tax Refund Payment
Spreadsheet_ "). The Tax Refund Payment Spreadsheet shall set forth the
following information in reasonable detail:

 


 

 

 

68    

(A) all information specified in _Sections 2.3(a)_ (i)-(iv) inclusive, as
updated to reflect the payment of the  Net Tax Refund; and

 


 

   

(B) the amount of any portion of the Net Tax Refund, payable to each Company
Securityholder in accordance with the  terms of the Governing Documents.

 


 

   

7.7 _Certain Taxes and Fees_. All Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by the
Indemnifying Parties and 50% by Buyer. The  Indemnifying Parties and Buyer
will cooperate to timely file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation with respect to such Transfer Taxes and the Indemnifying
Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other, shall each bear 50% of 
all related expenses.

 


 

   

7.8 _Payoff Letters and Release of Liens_.

 


 

   

(a) _Closing Indebtedness Payoff Letters_. No later than three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall  obtain from each creditor
of the Company or any Subsidiary (or an agent on behalf of such creditor) set
forth on _Schedule 7.8(a)_ , and deliver to Buyer, an executed payoff letter,
in customary form and substance, setting forth: (i) the  amounts required to
pay off in full on the Closing Date, the Indebtedness owing to such creditor
(including the outstanding principal, accrued and unpaid interest and
prepayment and other penalties) and wire transfer information for such 
payment; (ii) upon payment of such amounts, a customary release of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, including the automatic release of any and all Liens
securing such Indebtedness (subject to obligations which by their terms
expressly survive  such termination); and (iii) the commitment of the
creditor (or an agent on behalf of such creditor) to execute and deliver
documents that can be filed of record (or delivered to third parties)
evidencing the release all Liens, if any, that the  creditor (or an agent on
behalf of such creditor) may hold on any of the assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary prior to the Closing Date upon the receipt of amounts described in
clause (i) owing to such creditor (each, a " _Payoff Letter_ ").

 


 

   

(b) _Release of Liens_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all customary  agreements,
instruments, certificates and other documents, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer, that are necessary or appropriate to effect
the release of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), including those Liens
set  forth in _Schedule 7.8(b)_.

 


 

   

7.9 _Third-Party Expenses_.

 


 

   

(a) Whether or not the Merger is consummated, except as expressly set forth
herein, each party shall be responsible for its own  expenses and costs that
it incurs (and whether paid prior to, at or after the Effective Time) with
respect to the negotiation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement. Without limiting or expanding the foregoing, " _Third-Party 
Expenses_ " means, and the Company shall be responsible for all fees and
expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any Subsidiary prior to
the Effective Time (and whether paid prior to, at or after the Effective Time)
in  connection with this Agreement, the Related Agreements, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby that consist of the following: (i)
all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting, finders and all other

and (iv) 50% of any filings fees in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or  any Related Agreement, including under the

retention payments payable or equity awards  granted by Buyer pursuant to the
terms of any Offer Letter or other post-Closing employment arrangement with
Buyer (or its designated Affiliate), (B) all fees and expenses of third
parties incurred by Buyer and Merger Sub in connection with the  negotiation
and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the

not  receive an offer of employment from Buyer within fifteen (15) Business
Days of the Agreement Date, (D) any compensation, benefits or compensatory
payments made to any Continuing Employees post-Closing pursuant to their
respective employment  arrangements with Buyer (or its designated Affiliate)
or at Buyer's (or its designated Affiliate's) direction, (E) any compensation
pursuant to "double-trigger" arrangements triggered by actions of Buyer after
the Closing Date, (F) all  Transaction Payroll Taxes and (G) 50% of any
filings fees in connection with the transactions contemplated by this

69    

(b) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company shall
provide Buyer with a statement, in a form reasonably  satisfactory to Buyer,
setting forth all unpaid Third-Party Expenses incurred by or on behalf of the
Company or any Subsidiary as of the Closing Date, or anticipated to be

the Closing (the " _Statement of Expenses_ "). The Company shall obtain and
deliver to Buyer a final invoice of all outstanding and unpaid fees, costs and
expenses from each professional advisor listed on the Statement of Expenses 
(each, a " _Closing Expense Invoice_ "). No Subsidiary shall incur any Third-
Party Expenses that remain unpaid as of the Closing.

 


 

   

7.10 _Preparation and Delivery of Required Financial Statements_.

 


 

   

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within thirty (30)
days following the end of each fiscal quarter (other  than the fourth fiscal
quarter) ending on or after the Agreement Date, the Company shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of
the last day of each such fiscal quarter, and an unaudited  statement of
stockholders' equity, income and cash flow for such fiscal quarter, as well as
an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Company and a statement of
shareholders' equity, income and cash flow for the corresponding periods for 
the prior fiscal year (the " _Required Financial Statements_ "), which
Required Financial Statements shall (x) be prepared in accordance with GAAP
(and calculated in accordance with ASC 606 issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards  Board), applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated, and (y) not, for the avoidance of doubt, contain normal year-end
adjustments.

 


 

 

 

70    

(b) The Company shall (x) cooperate promptly with, and to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates and its and  their Representatives
to cooperate promptly with, Buyer and its Representatives in connection with
the preparation of the Required Financial Statements and to consider in good
faith all of Buyer's reasonable comments in connection therewith  (but shall
be under no compulsion to accept the same), (y) assist promptly, and use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to assist promptly, Buyer
and its Representatives in connection with the preparation of any filings, 
documents, or other materials, including any pro forma financial statements,
that may be required in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, or otherwise in connection with Buyer's reporting
obligations or  public offerings under applicable federal securities Laws,
including all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and Regulation S-X,
and (z) supply promptly and further furnish promptly, and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause its  Representatives to supply and furnish promptly,
any and all information, documents, and records as Buyer may reasonably
request, and provide reasonable access to the Company's personnel and
facilities, in connection with the matters  contemplated by this _Section
7.10_. The Company agrees that the Required Financial Statements will comply
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with
the rules and regulations of the SEC, as in effect as  of the respective
dates thereof and applicable to the Company, subject to the Required Financial
Statements being calculated in accordance with ASC 606.

 


 

   

7.11 _Access to Information_. At all times prior to the Effective Time or the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its  terms, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable advance notice and to the extent consistent
with applicable Laws and for the purposes of the investigation of the Company
or the transition of ownership thereof to Buyer, the Company shall  afford
Buyer, its Representatives and financing sources reasonable access to (i) all
of the assets, properties, Books and Records and Contracts of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, (ii) all other information concerning the business,
assets,  properties and personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries as
Buyer may reasonably request, and (iii) all Employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as identified by Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Company shall not be required  to provide such access to the extent it could
jeopardize any applicable attorney client or would result in breach of a
Material Contract to which the Company is a party or is otherwise bound;
provided,  however, that, in the event the Company withholds or prevents any
such access, it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Buyer,
its Representatives  and its financing sources such requested or sought
information or data pursuant to a reasonable alternative accommodation. The
Company agrees to provide to Buyer and its accountants, counsel, financing
sources and other Representatives copies  of internal financial statements
(including Tax Returns and supporting documentation) promptly upon request. No
information or knowledge obtained in any investigation conducted pursuant to
this _Section 7.11_ or otherwise shall affect or  be deemed to qualify,
limit, modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty contained
herein or in the Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and  provisions
of this Agreement, or the rights of Buyer or any Indemnified Party under or
arising out of a breach of this Agreement.

 


 

 

 

71    

7.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Buyer after obtaining Knowledge of: (a) the  occurrence or non-occurrence
of any event, the occurrence or non-occurrence of which is likely to cause any
representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement or any
Related Agreement to be untrue or inaccurate at or prior to  the Effective
Time, and (b) any failure of the Company to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 7.12_ shall not (a) limit or otherwise affect any remedies available
to the party receiving such notice or (b) constitute an  acknowledgment or
admission of a breach of this Agreement. No disclosure by the Company pursuant
to this _Section 7.12_, however, shall affect or be deemed to qualify, limit,
modify, amend or supplement any representation or warranty  contained herein
or in the Disclosure Schedule, the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the terms and provisions
of this Agreement, or the rights of Buyer or any Indemnified Party under or 
arising out of a breach of this Agreement. For clarity, unintentional failure
to give notice under this _Section 7.12_ shall not be deemed to be a breach of
covenant under this _Section 7.12_ and shall constitute only a breach of  the
underlying representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition, as the
case may be.

 


 

   

7.13 _Director and Officer Insurance and Indemnification_.

 


 

   

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain at its expense a fully
prepaid "tail" directors' and officers' liability insurance  policy, which
(i) has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii)
covers only those persons who are currently covered by the Company's existing
directors' and officers' liability insurance policy in effect as of the 
Agreement Date and only for matters occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time, and (iii) contains coverage terms comparable to those applicable to the
current directors and officers of the Company (the " _Company D andO Tail
Policy_").  The Surviving Corporation (following the Effective Time) and the
Buyer shall not cancel (or permit to be cancelled) the Company DandO Tail Policy
during its term.

 


 

   

(b) From and after the Effective Time, and until the sixth (6th) anniversary
of the Effective Time, Buyer shall cause the Surviving  Corporation (and, to
the extent applicable, any successor or assign of the Surviving Corporation)
to fulfill and honor in all material respects the obligations of the Company
to Persons who on or prior to the Effective Time are or were  directors
and/or officers of the Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ ") pursuant to any indemnification provisions under the Company's
Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or such Subsidiary's organizational 
documents as in effect on the Agreement Date and pursuant to any
indemnification agreements between the Company and such Company Indemnified
Parties existing as of the Agreement Date, in each case which have been
disclosed on the Disclosure  Schedule and true and complete copies of which
have been made available to the Buyer (the " _Company Indemnification
Provisions_ "), with respect to claims arising out of matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that (i) the foregoing
obligations shall be subject to any limitation imposed by applicable Law, and
(ii) no Company Indemnified Party shall have  any right of contribution,
indemnification or right of advancement from the Surviving Corporation or its
successor with respect to any Losses claimed by any of the Indemnified Parties
against such Company Indemnified Party in his or her  capacity as an
Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement. 
  
 

 

 

72    

(c) Subject to the other express terms of this Agreement, Buyer shall be under
no obligation to maintain the existence of the Surviving  Corporation for any
specified period following the Effective Time.

 


 

   

(d) The obligations of Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and its successors
under this _Section 7.13_ shall not be terminated,  amended, or otherwise
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Company Indemnified Party
(or his or her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns)
without the prior written consent of such Company Indemnified Party (or  his
or her heirs, personal representatives, successors, or assigns, as
applicable).

 


 

   

7.14 _Financing Cooperation_.

 


 

   

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall use, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to use, and shall use its commercially reasonable  efforts to

cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the arrangement
of  the Financing, including the following:

 


 

   

(i) furnishing Buyer and the Financing Sources the Required Financial

the cooperation of or is within the control of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of the Company; and

 


 

   

(vi) using commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the due diligence
investigation of the Financing Sources, to  the extent customary and
reasonable and not unreasonably interfering with the businesses of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries;

 


 

 

 

73    

provided that nothing herein shall require such cooperation  to the extent it
would interfere unreasonably with the businesses or operations of the Company
or its Subsidiaries; and provided, further, that neither the  Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives shall (1) be required
to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any other cost or expense
that is not reimbursed by Buyer in connection with the Financing  pursuant to
below or to pass resolutions or consents to approve or authorize the execution

precedent set forth in _Section 2.2(a)_ or _2.2(b)_ ;  or (5) be required to
execute and deliver any authorization letter, solvency certificate or

provided under this _Section 7.14_ shall be at the sole expense  of Buyer.

for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs  (including reasonable
and documented attorney's fees and expenses) incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation described above in _Section
7.14(a)_. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company  and its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities or losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith  (other than information provided by the Company or its
Subsidiaries), in each case, except to the extent such liabilities or losses
are suffered or incurred directly as a result of the bad faith, gross
negligence, or willful misconduct by the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or, in each case, their respective Representatives.

 


 

   

(c) The Company hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Company and its
Subsidiaries in connection with the Financing and  authorizes the Financing
Sources to download copies of such logos from its website for such purposes;
provided, that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended to

Subsidiaries and its or their marks.

actual or potential breach, default, withdrawal, repudiation or termination
of  the Commitment Letter; provided that in no event will Buyer be under any
obligation to disclose any information that is subject to attorney client or
similar privilege if Buyer shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts
to disclose  such information in a way that would not waive such privilege.

accordance with the terms hereof;

 


 

   

(f) by Buyer if it is not in material breach of its obligations under this

warranties of the Company set forth in this Agreement or in  the Officer's
Certificate shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the date that is
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date (the date of expiration of such
eighteen-month (18) period, the " _Expiration Date_ "); provided, however,
that (i) the Fundamental Representations shall survive until 11:59 p.m.
(Pacific time) on the date that is sixty (60) days following the date  after
any Person could, under applicable statutes of limitation (giving effect to
any extensions or waivers thereof), bring an Action against Buyer, the
Company, or any of their respective Affiliates (including the Surviving
Corporation) in  connection with such matters, and (ii) the Tax
Representations shall survive until 11:59 p.m. (Pacific time) on the date that

(giving effect to any extensions or waivers  thereof) applicable to the Taxes
that are the subject of such Tax Representations; provided, further, that in
the event of fraud with respect to a representation  or warranty, such
representation or warranty shall survive until the resolution of any claims
relating thereto; provided, further, that all representations and warranties
of the Company shall survive beyond the Expiration Date or other survival
periods specified above with respect to any inaccuracy therein or breach
thereof if a claim is made hereunder  prior to the expiration of the survival
period for such representation and warranty, in which case such representation
and warranty shall survive as to such claim until such claim has been finally
resolved.

 


 

   

(b) _Buyer Representations and Warranties_. The representations and warranties
of Buyer and Merger Sub contained in this  Agreement or in any certificate or

(c) _Contract Supersedes Statutes_. For the avoidance of doubt, it is the
intention of the parties hereto that the foregoing  respective survival
periods and termination dates in _Sections 9.1(a)-(b)_ supersede any
applicable statutes of limitations that would otherwise apply to such
representations and warranties.

their respective Indemnification Pro Rata Portions), indemnify and  hold
harmless Buyer and its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers,
directors, employees, agents and representatives, including the Surviving
Corporation (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against all Losses
paid,  incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties, or any of
them (including the Surviving Corporation) (regardless of whether or not such
Losses relate to any third-party claims), directly or indirectly, resulting
from, arising out  of, or relating to any of the following:

 


 

   

(i) any breach of or inaccuracy in, as of the Agreement Date or as of the
Effective Time, a representation or  warranty of the Company contained in
this Agreement or the Officer's Certificate, without giving effect to (A) any
qualifications based on the word "material" or similar phrases (including
"Company Material Adverse Effect") limiting the scope  of such representation
or warranty (provided that the operation of this clause (A) shall not be
deemed to render references to "Company Material Adverse Effect" to "Effect"
or references to "Material  Contract" to "Contract" and shall not apply to
(x) the third to last sentence of _Section 3.7(a)_ , (y) clause (i) of the
last sentence in _Section 3.7(c))_ or (z) _Section 3.9_ , or (B) any update of
or modification to the  Disclosure Schedule made or purported to have been
made on or after the Agreement Date (except solely with respect to, and as
required by, the second to last sentence of _Section 3.5(a)_ );

 


 

   

(ii) any failure by the Company to perform or comply with any of its covenants
or agreements set forth in this  Agreement or any Related Agreement;

or warranty, set forth in the Payment Spreadsheets, Pre-Closing Statement or
Statement of Expenses (including any unpaid Third-Party Expenses);

 


 

   

(iv) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any unpaid Pre-Closing Taxes not  reflected in Third-Party Expenses
or as a liability in Net Working Capital in the determination of Final Total
Closing Consideration;

 


 

   

(v) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, any Equityholder Matters;

 


 

   

(vi) regardless of the disclosure of any matter set forth in the Disclosure
Schedule, but subject to _Section 4.5_ ,  any fraud on the part of the
Company or any Subsidiary, or by any Company Securityholder or any
Representative of any of the foregoing in connection with this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby (solely with  respect to
matters involving the Company or any Subsidiary (and not matters personal to
such Company Securityholder or Representative)); and

 


 

 

 

77    

(vii) any Dissenting Shares (excluding payments for such shares) that have not
been paid by the Company prior to the  Closing in excess of the amount of
cash that otherwise would have been owed in respect of such shares in
accordance with this Agreement.

 


 

   

(b) For all purposes of and under this Agreement, " _Loss_ " or " _Losses_ "
shall mean any and all losses, liabilities, damages,  deficiencies, Taxes,
costs, interest, awards, judgments, penalties and expenses of any kind or
nature (including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees and expenses
incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or settling  any
of the matters set forth in _Section 9.2(a)_). For the avoidance of doubt,
"Losses" shall include incidental damages and indirect or other consequential
damages, but shall not include punitive or exemplary damages unless punitive
or  exemplary damages are awarded to a third party in any Action against an
Indemnified Party.

 


 

   

(c) The Indemnifying Parties (including any officer or director of the
Company) shall not have any right of contribution,  indemnification or right
of advancement from the Surviving Corporation or Buyer with respect to any
Loss claimed by an Indemnified Party payable by any of them in their capacity
as an Indemnifying Party.

 


 

   

(d) Any payments made to an Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification
obligations under this _Article IX_ will be treated  as adjustments to the
Total Consideration for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable
Laws.

 


 

   

(e) The rights of the Indemnified Parties to indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement, payment of Losses or any other remedy  under this Agreement
shall not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any
knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before
or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing  Date,
with respect to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any
other matter. The waiver of any condition based on the accuracy of any such
representation or  warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any
such covenant or agreement, will not affect the right to indemnification,
compensation or reimbursement, payment of Losses, or any other remedy based on
any such representation,  warranty, covenant or agreement. No Indemnified
Party shall be required to show reliance on any representation, warranty,
certificate or other agreement in order for such Indemnified Party to be
entitled to indemnification, compensation or  reimbursement hereunder.

 


 

   

9.3 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 


 

   

(a) Except in the case of fraud or indemnification claims for breaches of or
inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations or Tax  Representations, the
Indemnified Parties may not recover any Losses pursuant to an indemnification
claim under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ unless and until the amount of the
indemnifiable Qualifying Losses thereunder exceeds one million dollars 
($1,000,000) (the " _Basket_ ") in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover all Losses, including the amount of the Basket paid,
incurred, suffered or sustained by the Indemnified Parties. For the avoidance
of doubt,  the limitations set forth in this _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not apply
to indemnification claims under _clauses (ii)_ - _(vii)_ of _Section 9.2(a)_,
inclusive.

 


 

 

 

78    

(b) Except in the case of fraud or indemnification claims for breaches of or
inaccuracies in the Fundamental Representations or Tax  Representations the
Indemnifying Parties shall only be liable for any Loss relating to a single
claim (or series of claims arising from the same or substantially similar
facts or circumstances) in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars  ($25,000)
(such Loss or Losses, a " _Qualifying Loss_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
the limitations set forth in this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall not apply to
indemnification claims under _clauses (ii)_ - _(vii)_ of _Section 9.2(a)_, 
inclusive. 
  
 

   

(c) Subject to _Section 9.3(e)_ , recourse by the Indemnified Parties to the
Escrow Fund shall be the Indemnified Parties' sole  and exclusive remedy
under this Agreement for Losses resulting from the matters referred to in
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_. The limitation set forth in _Section 9.3(a)_ shall not
apply to indemnification claims (and shall not limit the  indemnification or
other obligations of such Indemnifying Party): (i) for inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Fundamental Representations or Tax Representations; or
(ii) under _clauses (ii)_ - _(vii)_ of _Section 9.2(a)_,  inclusive. To the
extent that the Indemnifying Parties are entitled to recovery under this
_Article IX_ in excess of the Escrow Fund, the Indemnified Parties shall not
be entitled to recover amounts directly from an Indemnifying Party  under
this _Article IX_ in respect of its, his or her indemnification obligations
until such time as the Escrow Fund has been fully exhausted or the amounts
contained in the Escrow Fund are otherwise allocated to cover existing, 
unresolved indemnification, compensation or reimbursement claims that have
been set forth in Indemnification Claim Notices delivered pursuant to _Section
9.5(a)_. Any amounts recovered by the Indemnified Parties from the Escrow
Fund  pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ with respect to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations or Tax Representations, or pursuant to any of the
matters referred to in _clauses (ii)_ - _(vii)_ of _Section 9.2(a)_,
inclusive,  shall not count towards or reduce the amount that the Indemnified
Parties may recover with respect to claims for indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement pursuant to _Sections 9.2(a)(i)_ for all other matters (it
being understood  that, in the case of such recovery from the Escrow Fund
with respect to Losses arising from breaches of the Fundamental
Representations or Tax Representations, or pursuant to any of the matters
referred to in _clauses (ii)_ - _(vii)_   of _Section 9.2(a)_, inclusive, or
_Section 2.4(c)_ the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover
indemnifiable Losses directly against the Indemnifying Parties up to the
amount of any Losses recovered from the Escrow Fund in  respect of such
Losses arising from breaches of the Fundamental Representations or Tax
Representations, or pursuant to any of the matters referred to in _clauses
(ii)_ - _(vii)_ of _Section 9.2(a)_, inclusive or _Section  2.4(c)_ ).

 


 

   

(d) Subject to _Section 9.3(e)_ , the total amount of indemnification payments
that each Indemnifying Party can be required to  make to the Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section 9.2_ (in excess of the amount, if any, paid to
the Indemnified Parties out of the Escrow Fund) shall be limited to the
portion of the Total Closing Consideration actually paid to such 
Indemnifying Party pursuant to _Section 1.3_ and _Section 2.3_ (without regard
to any Taxes deducted or to be deducted). For the avoidance of doubt, to the
extent any part of the Escrow Amount is paid in to the Escrow Fund on behalf 
of a Key Employee but is subsequently paid back to Buyer in accordance with
the terms of such Key Employee's Holdback Agreement and the Escrow Agreement,
Buyer shall have no recourse, in respect of such Key Employee's liabilities
resulting from  the matters referred to in _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ for all other
matters, against any amounts withheld from other Indemnifying Parties and paid
in (and released to) the Escrow Fund.

 


 

 

 

79    

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall limit the liability of, or the Indemnified
Parties' remedies against, any Person who perpetrates,  or who has actual
knowledge of (without a duty to investigate), fraud in relation to the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

   

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
indemnification rights set forth in this _Article IX_  shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Indemnified Parties from and after the Effective Time
for monetary damages in connection with the matters described in _Section
9.2(a)_ (which means that the survival periods and liability  limits set
forth in this _Article IX_ shall control notwithstanding any statutory or
common law provisions or principles to the contrary); provided, however, 
that nothing in this Agreement shall limit the Indemnified Parties' ability to
pursue (i) specific performance or injunctive relief or other non-monetary
equitable remedies, (ii) remedies under any Related Agreements (other than
the  certificates and documents to be delivered by the Company pursuant to
_Section 2.2(b)(xvii)_ against the parties thereto, and (iii) remedies against
any Person who perpetrates, or who has actual knowledge of (without a duty
to  investigate), fraud in relation to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 


 

   

(g) To the extent the Indemnified Parties are entitled to recover
indemnifiable Losses in respect of amounts which are indemnifiable  pursuant
to _Section 2.5_ by a particular Person who had received amounts pursuant to
this Agreement, Buyer shall first use reasonable best efforts to recover such
indemnifiable Losses from such Person prior to seeking recourse against  the
Escrow Fund pursuant to the terms of this _Article IX_.

 


 

   

(h) The amount of any Losses recoverable by any Indemnified Party under
_Section 9.2(a)_ shall be calculated net of any insurance  proceeds actually
received by, and/or any indemnification or contribution payments actually paid
by any third party to, such Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses in,
each case net all costs of recovery, including reasonably anticipated 
increases in insurance premiums; provided, however, that in no event shall any
Indemnified Party be required to seek or obtain any such insurance proceeds
or  third-party indemnification or contribution. If an Indemnified Party
receives any amounts under applicable insurance policies or third-party
indemnification or contribution payments subsequent to its receipt of an
indemnification payment by the  Indemnifying Parties (including from the
Escrow Fund), then such Indemnified Party will, without duplication, promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Parties (including via replenishing the Escrow
Fund, if applicable) for any payment made by such  Indemnifying Parties up to
the amount received by the Indemnified Party; provided that the aggregate
amount of reimbursement payments to the Indemnifying Parties will not in any
event exceed the  aggregate indemnification payment received by the
Indemnified Party from the Indemnifying Parties. For clarity, nothing in this
_Section 9.3(h)_ will be deemed to prejudice the ability of any Indemnified
Party to seek recourse against the  Escrow Fund at any time according to the
other terms and conditions of this _Article IX_, but rather this _Section
9.3(h)_ is intended solely to prevent multiple recoveries by any Indemnified
Party for the same Losses.

 


 

 

 

80    

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying
Parties shall not have any liability or indemnification  obligation for (i)
any Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary resulting from any action taken by
the Company after the Closing on the Closing Date outside of the ordinary
course of business, or (ii) the inability of Buyer, the Surviving 
Corporation or any of their Affiliates to utilize to any extent any Tax asset
or attribute (e.g., net operating loss carryforward or Tax credit
carryforward) in any Tax period or portion thereof (including any Straddle Tax
Period) beginning on  or after the Closing Date.

 


 

   

(j) Any claim for indemnification under this _Article IX_, and any offer to
compromise or settle such claim, must be made on a  pro rata basis to all
Indemnifying Parties (based on their respective Indemnification Pro Rata
Portions).

 


 

   

(k) Any liability for indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of  the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach or other violation of more
than one representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, certificate or
certification. In addition, if and solely to the extent that an amount of 
Losses in connection with an indemnifiable matter was already taken into
account in connection with calculation of the Final Total Closing
Consideration, the same amount of such Losses may not be recovered under this
_Article IX_.

 


 

   

(l) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in no event will
any Indemnifying Party be liable for any other  Indemnifying Party's breach
of such other Indemnifying Party's representations, warranties, covenants, or
agreements contained in any Holdback Agreement, Joinder Agreement, Non-
Competition and Non-Solicitation Agreements or other ancillary  agreement
hereto to which such other Indemnifying Party is a party.

 


 

   

9.4 _Escrow Fund_.

 


 

   

(a) The Escrow Fund shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties
for any claims by such parties for any Losses suffered or  incurred by them
and for which they are entitled to recovery under this _Article IX_. Except as
set forth below, the period during which claims for Losses to be recovered
from the Escrow Fund may be made under this Agreement shall  commence at the
Closing and terminate on the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date (the " _Escrow Period_ ").

 


 

   

(b) No later than five (5) Business Days after the end of the Escrow Period or
the date a Subsequent Escrow Release Amount is due to the  Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to _Section 9.5(c)_ , the Securityholder Representative shall
deliver to Buyer an updated version of the Closing Payment Spreadsheet (each,
an " _Escrow Release Payment Spreadsheet_ ") within five (5)  Business Days
after such date in a form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer and
accompanied by documentation reasonably satisfactory to Buyer in support of
the information set forth therein. The Escrow Release Payment Spreadsheet 
shall set forth the following information in reasonable detail:

 


 

   

(i) all information specified in _Sections 2.3(a)_ (i)-(iv) inclusive, as
updated to reflect the release of  the Initial Escrow Release Amount or
Subsequent Escrow Release Amount, as applicable; and

 


 

 

 

81    

(ii) the amount of any portion of the Initial Escrow Release Amount or
Subsequent Escrow Release Amount, as  applicable, payable to each Company
Securityholder in accordance with the terms of the Governing Documents.

 


 

   

(c) No later than five (5) Business Days after Buyer receives the Escrow
Release Payment Spreadsheet, the remaining portion of the  Escrow Amount,
less any amount of actual Losses or Losses estimated in good faith, if
possible, in respect of any resolved claims that have yet to be satisfied or
any unresolved and pending claims specified in any Officer's Certificate (the
" _Unresolved      Claims_ ") delivered to the Escrow Agent and the
Securityholder Representative in accordance with _Section 9.5_ on or prior to
the end of the Escrow Period (the " _Initial_ ___Escrow Release Amount_ "),
shall be  distributed to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Release Payment Spreadsheet.

 


 

   

(d) In the event that there exist Unresolved Claims as of the expiration of
the Escrow Period, as soon as each such Unresolved Claims  has been resolved,
the Escrow Agent shall promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business
Days following the after Buyer receives the Escrow Release Payment
Spreadsheet, deliver to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the terms
of  the Escrow Agreement, the portion of the Escrow Fund, if any, that was
retained for purposes of satisfying such claim that was not needed to satisfy
such claim (each a " _Subsequent Escrow Release Amount_ ") in accordance with
the Escrow  Release Payment Spreadsheet.

 


 

   

9.5 _Indemnification Claim Procedures_.

 


 

   

(a) Subject to the limitations set forth in _Section 9.3_, if an Indemnified
Party wishes to make an indemnification claim under  this _Article IX_, such
Indemnified Party shall deliver a written notice (an " _Indemnification Claim
Notice_ ") to the Securityholder Representative (with a copy to the Escrow
Agent) (i) stating that an Indemnified Party has paid,  incurred, suffered or
sustained, or reasonably anticipates that it may pay, incur, suffer or sustain
Losses, and (ii) specifying such Losses in reasonable detail (to the extent
available), the date (if available) that each such Loss was paid,  incurred,
suffered or sustained, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and, if
applicable, the nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or
covenant to which such item is related. Buyer may update an Indemnification
Claim  Notice from time to time to reflect any change in circumstances
following the date thereof; provided that the update relates to the underlying
facts and circumstances described in the initial  Indemnification Claim
Notice.

 


 

   

(b) If the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
(or the Indemnifying Party in the event that  indemnification is being sought
hereunder directly from such Indemnifying Party) shall not object in writing
within the thirty-day (30) period after receipt of an Indemnification Claim
Notice by delivery of a written notice of objection  containing a reasonably
detailed description of the facts and circumstances supporting an objection to
the applicable indemnification claim (an " _Indemnification Claim Objection
Notice_ "), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable  acknowledgment
by the Securityholder Representative on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties (or
the applicable Indemnifying Party) that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such Indemnification 
Claim Notice. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from the
Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set forth in such
Indemnification Claim Notice.

 


 

 

 

82    

(c) In the event that the Securityholder Representative shall deliver an
Indemnification Claim Objection Notice in accordance with _Section 9.5(b)_ 
(or in the event that indemnification is being sought hereunder directly from
an Indemnifying Party, if such Indemnifying Party shall object to any claim or
claims made in any Indemnification Claim Notice to recover claims directly
from such  Indemnifying Party within thirty (30) days after delivery of such
Indemnification Claim Notice), the Securityholder Representative (or such
objecting Indemnifying Party) and Buyer shall attempt in good faith to agree
upon the rights of the  respective parties with respect to each of such
claims. If the Securityholder Representative (or such objecting Indemnifying
Party) and Buyer should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both  parties and, in the case of an
indemnification claim to be recovered from the Escrow Fund, shall be furnished
to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such
memorandum and make distributions from the Escrow Fund in  accordance with
the terms thereof. In such event, the Escrow Agent shall promptly release from
the Escrow Fund cash with an aggregate value equal to the Losses set forth in
such Indemnification Claim Notice.

 


 

   

(d) If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation and prior
to thirty (30) days after delivery of an Indemnification  Claim Objection
Notice, Buyer may file suit with respect to the matter in any court having
jurisdiction.

 


 

   

9.6 _Defense of Third Party Claims_. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any Person of any claim or Action (whether  against the
Surviving Corporation, Buyer or any other Person) with respect to which the
Indemnifying Parties may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify,
compensate or reimburse any Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Article IX_
,  Buyer shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the defense
of such claim or Action on its own with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Securityholder Representative, and the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled, at  the Indemnifying Parties' expense, to participate in, but not
determine or conduct, the defense of such claim or Action and Buyer shall keep
the Securityholder Representative reasonably apprised of any material
development in such Action, and  promptly provide to the Securityholder
Representative copies of all pleadings, notices and communications with
respect to such claim or Action to the extent that receipt of such documents
does not waive any privilege. If Buyer so proceeds with  the defense of any
such claim or Action: 
  
 

   

(a) subject to the other provisions of this _Article IX_ , all reasonable
expenses relating to the defense of such claim or  Action (and all amounts
due pursuant to any settlement, adjustment or compromise of such claim or
Action) shall be borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnifying Parties to the
extent that either (i) it is determined according to the procedures  in this
_Article IX_ that such claim or Action (or the matters underlying such claim
or Action) constitutes an indemnifiable matter under _Section 9.2_ or (ii)
Buyer and the Securityholder Representative otherwise agree in writing  that
such costs and expenses shall constitute indemnifiable Losses; provided, that
the absence of a final determination (including by a Governmental Entity or an
arbitrator) with respect to such claim  or Action shall not prejudice or
otherwise affect the determination as to whether such claim or Action arose
out of, resulted from, or was in connection with a matter listed in _Section
9.2_ ; and

 


 

 

 

83    

(b) Buyer shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or
Action without the consent of the Securityholder  Representative (it being
understood that if Buyer requests that the Securityholder Representative
consent to a settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Securityholder
Representative shall not  unreasonably withhold or delay such consent;
provided, that the Securityholder Representative may withhold consent to any
requested settlement, adjustment or compromise if the Securityholder 
Representative believes in good faith that there is not any underlying basis
for indemnification under this _Article IX_ with respect to such settlement,
adjustment or compromise); provided, however, that if Buyer settles, adjusts
or compromises any such claim or Action without the consent of the
Securityholder Representative, then such settlement, adjustment or compromise
shall not be  conclusive evidence of the amount of Losses incurred by the
Indemnified Party in connection with such claim or Action or that such Losses
are indemnifiable hereunder.

   


 

 

If Buyer does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Action, the Securityholder Representative may proceed with the defense of such
claim or  Action with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; provided,
however, that the Securityholder Representative may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim or Action without the prior written  consent of
Buyer (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) unless (i)
such judgment, settlement or compromise includes an unconditional release from
all liability with respect to the claim in favor of the Indemnified Parties 
or (ii) the sole relief provided in connection with such judgment, settlement
or compromise is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying
Parties (including from the Escrow Fund) or any other relief that is
enforceable only  against the Indemnifying Parties. Buyer shall give the
Securityholder Representative prompt notice of the commencement of any such
Action against Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company; provided, however,  that any
failure on the part of Buyer to so notify the Securityholder Representative
shall not limit any of the obligations of the Indemnifying Parties under this
_Article IX_ (except to the extent such failure materially prejudices the 
defense of such Action).

   


 

   

ARTICLE X 
  
  _SECURITYHOLDER REPRESENTATIVE_

 

_ 
  _

   

10.1 _Appointment and Authority of Securityholder Representative_.

 


 

   

(a) By virtue of the execution and delivery of a Joinder Agreement, the
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by the  Company
Shareholders or participating in the Merger and receiving the benefits
thereof, including the right to receive the consideration payable in
connection with the Merger, each of the Indemnifying Parties shall be deemed
to have agreed to  appoint Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its
exclusive representative, agent, proxy, and attorney-in-fact (with full power
of substitution), as the Securityholder Representative for and on behalf of
the Indemnifying Parties for all  purposes in connection with this Agreement,
the Escrow Agreement, and the agreements ancillary hereto, including (a) to
give and receive notices and communications in respect of all Relevant
Matters, including claims under this Agreement, (b)  to authorize, consent or
object to any claims hereunder and authorize payment to any Indemnified Party
from the Escrow Fund, in satisfaction of any claims hereunder by any
Indemnified Party, or in satisfaction of the provisions of _Section  2.4_ ,
(c) to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to any Relevant Matter, including any 
claim for indemnification pursuant to this Agreement by any Indemnified Party
hereunder against any Indemnifying Party or by any such Indemnifying Party
against any Indemnified Party or any dispute between any Indemnified Party and
any such  Indemnifying Party, in each case relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (d) consent or agree to any amendment to
this Agreement, (e) grant any extension or waiver under or in connection with
this Agreement, and (e)  and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Securityholder Representative
in connection with this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and the Securityholder
Representative Engagement Agreement  or (ii) specifically mandated,
permitted, or contemplated by the terms of this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder Representative shall  have
no obligation to act on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties except as expressly
provided herein, in the Escrow Agreement and in the Securityholder
Representative Engagement Agreement, and for purposes of clarity, there are no
obligations of  the Securityholder Representative to the Indemnifying Parties
in any ancillary agreement, schedule, exhibit or the Disclosure Schedule. All
actions taken by the Securityholder Representative under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, or the  Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement
shall be binding upon each Indemnifying Party and such Indemnifying Party's
successors as if expressly confirmed and ratified in writing by such
Indemnifying Party, and all defenses which may  be available to any
Indemnifying Party to contest, negate, or disaffirm the action of the
Securityholder Representative taken in good faith under this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement
are  waived. The Securityholder Representative may resign at any time. Such
agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from time to time upon not
less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to Buyer; provided,  however,
that the Securityholder Representative may not be removed unless holders
representing an aggregate Deemed Pro Rata Portion of two-thirds (2/3) agree to
such removal and to the identity of the  substituted agent. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, a vacancy in the position of Securityholder Representative may
be filled by the holders representing an aggregate Deemed Pro Rata Portion of
greater than one-half (1/2). The immunities and  rights to indemnification
hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal of the Securityholder
Representative or any member of the Advisory Group, and the Closing and/or any
termination of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. No bond  shall be
required of the Securityholder Representative. Notices or communications to or
from the Securityholder Representative shall constitute notice to or from the
Indemnifying Parties. The powers, immunities, and rights to indemnification 
granted to the Securityholder Representative Group hereunder: (i) are coupled
with an interest and shall be irrevocable and binding on any successor
thereto, and (ii) shall survive the delivery of an assignment by any
Indemnifying Party of the  whole or any fraction of his, her, or its interest
in the Escrow Fund.

 


 

 

 

84    

(b) The Securityholder Representative (x) shall receive a copy in electronic
format of the contents of the electronic dataroom in  connection with the
Closing and (y) shall have reasonable access to information about the
Surviving Corporation and the reasonable assistance of the Company's former
officers and employees for to the extent reasonably necessary for purposes
of  performing its duties and exercising its rights hereunder; provided that
the Securityholder Representative shall treat confidentially and not use or
disclose the terms of this Agreement or any  nonpublic information from or
about Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, to
anyone (except to the Indemnifying Parties or the Securityholder
Representative's employees, attorneys, accountants, financial advisors  or
authorized representatives on a need to know basis, in each case, who agree to
treat such information confidentially); provided, however, that none of
Buyer  nor any of its Affiliates, including the Surviving Corporation, shall
be obligated to provide any such access or information if it determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that: (i) it is prohibited from doing so pursuant to
the terms of a  confidentiality agreement with a third party; (ii) the access
or disclosure would violate applicable Law; (iii) the access or disclosure
would cause the loss of or jeopardize any attorney-client, attorney work
product or other privilege; (iv)  the access or disclosure would result in
the disclosure of a Trade Secret or other highly confidential, competitive, or
sensitive information; or (v) access or disclosure to a requested Contract
would violate or cause a default under, or give a  third party the right to
terminate or accelerate any rights under such Contract. The Securityholder
Representative shall enter into a separate customary confidentiality agreement
prior to being provided access to such information if reasonably  requested
by Buyer.

 


 

 

 

85    

10.2 _Exculpation and Indemnification of Shareholder Representation_. Neither
the Securityholder Representative nor its members,  managers, directors,
officers, contractors, agents or employees or any member of the Advisory Group
(collectively, the " _Securityholder Representative Group_ ") shall be liable
to any Indemnifying Party for any act done or omitted hereunder  as
Securityholder Representative while acting in good faith and without gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Securityholder Representative shall not
be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel. The
Indemnifying  Parties on whose behalf the Escrow Amount was contributed to
the Escrow Fund shall indemnify the Securityholder Representative Group and
hold the Securityholder Representative Group harmless against any loss,
liability, claim, damage, fee,  cost, judgment, fine, amount paid in
settlement or expense incurred or suffered, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of the Securityholder Representative's
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and  expenses of any legal
counsel or other professionals retained by the Securityholder Representative
and costs incurred in connection with seeking recovery from insurers ("
_Securityholder Representative Expenses_ "); provided, that in the  event
that any such Securityholder Representative Expenses are finally adjudicated
to have been directly caused by the gross negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct of the Securityholder Representative, the Securityholder
Representative  will reimburse the Indemnifying Parties the amount of such
indemnified Securityholder Representative Expenses to the extent attributable
to such gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct. If not paid
directly to the Securityholder  Representative by the Indemnifying Parties,
any such Securityholder Representative Expenses may be recovered by the
Securityholder Representative from (i) the funds in the Expense Fund or (ii)
following the expiration of each Escrow Period from  the Escrow Amount
otherwise distributable to or for the benefit of the Indemnifying Parties only
at the time of distribution of such amounts (and not distributed or
distributable to an Indemnified Party or subject to a pending
indemnification  claim of an Indemnified Party) pursuant to the terms hereof
and of the Escrow Agreement; provided, that while this section allows the
Securityholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the  Indemnifying Parties from their obligation
to promptly pay such Securityholder Representative Expenses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Securityholder Representative
from seeking any remedies available to it at law or  otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties otherwise applicable to, the 
Indemnifying Parties set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to
be applicable to the indemnities provided to the Securityholder Representative
under this section. A decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder  Representative, including an amendment, extension or waiver
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.5_ or _Section 11.6_, shall
constitute a decision of the Indemnifying Parties and shall be final,
conclusive and binding upon  Indemnifying Parties; and the Escrow Agent and
Buyer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative as being the decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Indemnifying Parties. The Escrow  Agent and Buyer are
hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Securityholder Representative. Certain Indemnifying Parties (the " _Advisory 
Group_ ") have concurrently herewith entered into a letter agreement with the
Securityholder Representative (the " _Securityholder Representative Engagement
Agreement_ ") regarding direction to be provided by the Advisory Group to
the  Securityholder Representative under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and the Securityholder Representative Engagement Agreement. The Advisory Group
shall incur no liability to the Indemnifying Parties for any liability
incurred by the  members of the Advisory Group while acting in good faith and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of their
duties (it being understood that any act done or omitted pursuant to the
advice of counsel shall be  conclusive evidence of such good faith), even if
such act or omission constitutes negligence on the part of the Advisory Group
or one of its members. The Indemnifying Parties agree that the Securityholder
Representative shall be entitled to:  (i) rely upon the Payment Spreadsheets,
(ii) rely upon any signature believed by it to be genuine, and (iii)
reasonably assume that a signatory has proper authorization to sign on behalf
of the applicable Indemnifying Party or other party. This  indemnification
shall survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the Securityholder
Representative, termination of this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

10.3 _Expense Cash_.

 


 

   

(a) The Expense Cash shall be deposited with the Securityholder
Representative, to constitute an expense fund (the " _Expense Fund_
")      and to be governed by the provisions set forth herein. The
Expense Cash shall be available to pay directly or reimburse the
Securityholder Representative for any Securityholder Representative Expenses
or other third-party expenses reasonably  and actually incurred by the
Securityholder Representative, or to satisfy any claims against the
Indemnifying Parties hereunder if the Securityholder Representative shall
determine there are sufficient funds for such purpose, and shall be  released
to the Indemnifying Parties and the Securityholder Representative, as the case
may be, pursuant to the terms of this _Section 10.3_. As soon as reasonably
determined by the Securityholder Representative that the Expense Cash is  no
longer required to be withheld, the Securityholder Representative shall:

 


 

   

(b) prepare an updated version of the Closing Payment Spreadsheet (the "
_Expense Cash Release Payment Spreadsheet_ "). The Expense  Cash Release
Payment Spreadsheet shall set forth the following information in reasonable
detail:

 


 

   

(i) All information specified in _Sections 2.3(a)_ (i)-(iv) inclusive, as
updated to reflect the release of  the Remaining Expense Fund Amount; and

 


 

 

 

87    

(ii) the amount of any portion of the Remaining Expense Fund Amount, payable
to each Company Securityholder in accordance with the terms  of the Governing
Documents,

 


 

   

(c) deposit the remaining balance of the Expense Cash (if any) (the "
_Remaining Expense Fund Amount_ ") with the Payment Agent for  further
distribution to the Indemnifying Parties in accordance with the Expense Cash
Release Payment Spreadsheet.; provided, that, if there are any pending but 
unresolved indemnification claims of any Indemnified Parties, then all amounts
shall remain in escrow and remain available for release to the Securityholder
Representative until all indemnification claims have been finally resolved and
the  Securityholder Representative has been reimbursed in full for all
Securityholder Representative Expenses reasonably and actually incurred and
thereafter any remaining Expense Cash shall be released to the respective
Indemnifying Parties (by the  Surviving Corporation or the Payment Agent, as
applicable) in accordance with the Expense Cash Release Payment Spreadsheet.

 


 

   

(d) The Indemnifying Parties agree that no provision of this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement or any agreements ancillary hereto shall  require the
Securityholder Representative to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise
incur any financial liability in the exercise or performance of any of its
powers, rights, duties or privileges under this Agreement, the Escrow
Agreement or  any agreements ancillary hereto. For clarity, no Indemnified
Party shall have any liability with respect to the Expense Cash, including
with respect to the distribution, investment, holding and disposition thereof.

 


 

   

(e) The Securityholder Representative is not providing any investment
supervision, recommendations or advice and shall have no  responsibility or
liability to the Indemnifying Parties for any loss of principal of the Expense
Cash other than as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The
Securityholder Representative will hold these funds separate from  its
corporate funds, will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any
other corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available
to its creditors in the event of bankruptcy. The Securityholder Representative
is not  acting as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in
connection with the Expense Cash, and has no tax reporting or income
distribution obligations. The Indemnifying Parties will not receive any
interest or earnings on the Expense Cash  and irrevocably transfer and assign
to the Securityholder Representative any such interest or earnings. The
Securityholder Representative may contribute funds to the Expense Fund from
any consideration otherwise distributable to the  Indemnifying Parties.

 


 

   

For income Tax purposes, the Expense Cash shall be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Indemnifying Parties on the Closing
Date, and  any Tax withholding required with respect to an Indemnifying
Party's deemed receipt of its Deemed Pro Rata Portion of the Expense Cash on
the Closing Date shall be satisfied from any amounts payable or otherwise
deliverable pursuant to this  Agreement to such Indemnifying Party,
consistent with _Section 2.5_.

11.3 _Confidentiality_. Each of the parties hereto hereby agrees that the
information obtained in any investigation pursuant to _Section 7.11_  or any
information obtained pursuant to the notice requirements of _Section 7.12_, or
otherwise pursuant to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or the
effectuation of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall be governed by 
the terms of the Non-Disclosure Agreement, dated July 26, 2019 (the "
_Confidential Disclosure Agreement_ "), between the Company and Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 11.3_ , neither this
_Section  11.3_ nor any other provision of this Agreement or the Confidential
Disclosure Agreement shall be deemed to limit any customary disclosure
(subject to customary "click-through" confidentiality agreements) made by
Buyer, Merger Sub and  their Affiliates and/or Representatives to the
Financing Sources, the Financing Source Related Parties or rating agencies in
connection with the Financing. 
 

 


 

   

11.4 _Public Disclosure_. Neither the Company nor any of its Representatives
shall issue any statement or communication to any  third party (other than
its agents that are bound by confidentiality restrictions and other than to a
Governmental Entity to the extent required in the making of any filing or
notification required in connection with the transactions described  herein
or to respond to any request for information or documents made by a
Governmental Entity investigating the transactions described herein) regarding
the subject matter of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
including,  if applicable, the termination of this Agreement and the reasons
therefor, without the consent of Buyer; provided, however, that in the event
that any party hereto alleges a breach of this Agreement, the Company and its
Representatives may make  disclosures as needed to prosecute or defend
against such allegations to persons involved in dispute resolution proceedings
(e.g., courts, attorneys, witnesses).

 


 

 

 

91    

11.5 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented by the parties hereto at any time by execution  of an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of the party against whom enforcement is sough;
provided, that neither any provision with respect to which any Financing
Source is a third-party beneficiary  hereunder (nor the definitions of the
terms "Financing Sources" and "Financing Source Related Parties" or any other
definition set forth in, or any other provision of, this Agreement to the
extent that an amendment, modification, alteration,  supplementation,
discharge or waiver thereof would amend, modify , alter, supplement, discharge
or waive the substance of any provision with respect to which any Financing
Source is a third party beneficiary hereunder or the definitions of the 
terms "Financing Sources" or "Financing Source Related Parties") shall be
amended, modified, altered, supplemented, discharged or waived in a manner
materially adverse to such Financing Source without the prior written consent
of such Financing  Source (and any such amendment, modification, alteration,
supplement, discharge or waiver without such prior written consent shall be
null and void). For purposes of this _Section 11.5_, the Company
Securityholders are deemed to have  agreed that any amendment, modification,
alteration, or supplement of this Agreement signed by the Securityholder
Representative shall be binding upon and effective against the Company
Securityholders whether or not they have signed such any  amendment,
modification, alteration or supplement.

 


 

   

11.6 _Extension and Waiver_. At any time prior to the Closing, Buyer, on the
one hand, and before the Closing the Company and after  the Closing the
Securityholder Representative, on the other hand, may, to the extent legally
allowed and subject to the proviso set forth in _Section 11.5_ , (a) extend
the time for the performance of any of the obligations of the other  party
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made
to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto,
and (c) waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions
for  the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of
a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. For purposes
of this _Section 11.6_,  the Company Securityholders are deemed to have
agreed that any extension or waiver signed by the Company (if prior to
Closing) or the Securityholder Representative (if after the Closing) shall be
binding upon and effective against all Company  Securityholders whether or
not they have signed such extension or waiver.

 


 

   

11.7 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or
otherwise, except that Buyer may assign its rights  and delegate its
obligations hereunder to its Affiliates as long as Buyer remains ultimately
liable for all of Buyer's obligations hereunder.

 


 

   

11.8 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a  court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as 
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further
agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a
valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic,  business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable
provision.

 


 

 

 

92    

11.9 _Specific Performance and Other Remedies_.

 


 

   

(a) The parties to this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by the other party or parties hereto, any  Company
Securityholder or the Securityholder Representative of any covenant,
obligation or other agreement set forth in this Agreement, (i) each party
shall be entitled, without any proof of actual damages (and in addition to any
other remedy  that may be available to it), to a decree or order of specific
performance or mandamus to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant, obligation or other agreement and an injunction preventing or
restraining such breach or  threatened breach, and (ii) no party hereto shall
be required to provide or post any bond or other security or collateral in
connection with any such decree, order or injunction or in connection with any
related action or legal proceeding.

 


 

   

(b) Except as expressly set forth herein, any and all remedies herein
expressly conferred herein upon a party hereto shall be deemed to  be
cumulative with, and not exclusive of, any other remedy conferred hereby, or
by law or in equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party hereto of any
one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. However,
following the  Closing, the rights to indemnification, compensation and
reimbursement set forth in _Article IX_ shall be the sole and exclusive
monetary remedy of the Indemnified Parties with respect to any breach of this
Agreement.

 


 

   

(c) The liability of any Person under _Article IX_ will be in addition to, and
not exclusive of, any other liability that such  Person may have at law or in
equity based on such Person's fraudulent acts or omissions. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the provisions
set forth in this Agreement, including the provisions set  forth in _Article
IX_, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to this Agreement of any right or
remedy which such party may have at law or in equity based on any Person's
fraudulent acts or omissions, against such Person, nor will any such 
provisions limit, or be deemed to limit (i) the amounts of recovery sought or
awarded in any such claim for fraud, (ii) the time period during which a claim
for fraud may be brought or (iii) the recourse which any such party may seek
against  any Person with respect to a claim for fraud by such Person.

 


 

   

11.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all claims, causes of action
(whether in contract, tort or statute) or other matter that  may result from,
arise out of, be in connection with or relating to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, administration, performance, or enforcement of this Agreement,
including any claim or cause of action resulting from, arising out of, in 
connection with, or relating to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement (the " _Relevant Matters_ "), shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,
regardless of  the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof ; provided that each of the Company
(on behalf of itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries), Buyer  (on
behalf of itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries) and Securityholder
Representative (on behalf of itself and the Company Shareholders and other
Indemnifying Parties) agrees (for the avoidance of doubt, without affecting
the  provisions of _Section 11.17_ ) that any action, cause of action, claim,
cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or
in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Source or  any Financing Source Related Party in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Financing or the
performance thereof, shall  be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws that might otherwise
govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof, except as
otherwise expressly provided in the  Commitment Letter; provided further that
the references in this _Section 11.10_ to any Financing Source and its
Financing Source Related Parties shall be  to such Financing Source in its
capacity as a provider or arranger of the Financing and not in any other
capacity.

 


 

 

 

93    

11.11 _Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Any legal suit, action or proceeding arising
out of or in connection with any Relevant Matter shall  be instituted first
in, and each party hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction and venue
of, the Court of Chancery within New Castle County in the State of Delaware
(and any appellate court thereof located within such county) and to the 
extent such Court of Chancery (or appellate court thereof located within such
county) lacks jurisdiction over the matter, the federal courts of the United
States of America located within New Castle County in the State of Delaware,
and each  party irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such
courts in any such suit, action or proceeding. Service of process, summons,
notice or other document by mail to such party's address set forth herein
shall be effective service of  process for any suit, action or other
proceeding brought in any such court. The parties irrevocably and
unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any suit, action
or any proceeding in such courts and irrevocably waive and  agree not to
plead or claim in any such court that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of the
Company (on  behalf of itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries),
Buyer (on behalf of itself and on behalf of each of its Subsidiaries) and
Security Representative (on behalf of itself and the Company Shareholders and
other Indemnifying Parties)  agrees (for the avoidance of doubt, without
affecting the provisions of _Section 11.17_ ) that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or  in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Source or any Financing Source
Related Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute  arising out of or
relating in any way to the Financing or the performance thereof, in any forum
other than the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York Federal or, if that court does not have subject matter  jurisdiction,
the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (and appellate
courts thereof).

 


 

   

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND ANY ACTION,  PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO
(A) ANY RELEVANT MATTER OR (B) ANY ACTION, CAUSE OF ACTION, CLAIM, CROSS-CLAIM
OR THIRD-PARTY CLAIM OF ANY KIND OR DESCRIPTION, WHETHER IN  LAW OR IN
EQUITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR IN TORT OR OTHERWISE, AGAINST ANY FINANCING
SOURCE OR ANY FINANCING SOURCE RELATED PARTY IN ANY WAY RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING
ANY  DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE FINANCING OR THE
PERFORMANCE THEREOF; PROVIDED HOWEVER, THAT THE REFERENCES IN THIS _SECTION
11.12_ TO ANY FINANCING SOURCE AND ITS FINANCING  SOURCE RELATED PARTIES
SHALL BE TO SUCH FINANCING SOURCE IN ITS CAPACITY AS A PROVIDER OR ARRANGER OF
THE FINANCING AND NOT IN ANY OTHER CAPACITY.

 


 

 

 

94    

11.13 _USA Patriot Act Compliance_. To help the government fight the funding
of terrorism and money laundering activities, federal  law requires all
financial institutions to obtain, verify and record information that
identifies each person who opens an account. For a non-natural Person such as
a business entity, a charity, a trust or other legal entity the Escrow Agent 
will ask for documentation to verify its formation and existence as a legal
entity. The Escrow Agent may also ask to see financial statements, licenses,
identification and authorization documents from natural persons claiming
authority to  represent the entity or other relevant documentation. The
parties each agree to provide all such information and documentation as to
themselves as requested by Escrow Agent to ensure compliance with federal law.

 


 

   

11.14 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, _Annex A_ hereto, the Exhibits and
Schedules hereto, the Disclosure Schedule, the  Related Agreements, and the
documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
referenced herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties hereto
with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersede  all prior
agreements and understandings both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter of this Agreement, and are not intended to
confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except that (x)
the  Indemnified Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of _Article
IX_ and (y) the Financing Sources and the Financing Source Related Parties
shall be express third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to rely
on, the proviso  in the first sentence of _Section 11.5_ (and the reference
thereto in _Section 11.6_ ), the proviso in _Section 11.10_ the last sentence
of _Section 11.11_ , _Section 11.12_ , _Section 11.17_ and this
_Section      11.14_.

 


 

   

11.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same  agreement
and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by
each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that
all parties need not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of a fully
