Time

 



      
 

 



 

(collectively, the " _Company Common Stock_ " and, each, a " _Share_ "),
including all Restricted Shares, but excluding Shares to be cancelled pursuant
to _Section 2.1(b)_, shall be converted automatically into the right to
receive $49.38 per Share in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest. All Shares that have been converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 2.1(a)_ shall be
automatically cancelled upon the conversion thereof and shall cease to exist,
and the holders of certificates that immediately before the Effective Time
represented such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares other than the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
this _Section 2.1(a)_ upon the surrender of such certificates in accordance
with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

 



 

(b) _Parent- and Merger-Sub-Owned Shares_. Each Share that is owned directly
by Parent or Merger Sub immediately before the Effective Time (the "
_Cancelled Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange for such cancellation.

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, no
par value, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, no par value per share, of the
Surviving Corporation. From and after the Effective Time, all certificates
representing the common stock of Merger Sub shall be deemed for all purposes
to represent the number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation
into which they were converted in accordance with the immediately preceding
sentence.

 



 

(d) _Adjustments to Merger Consideration_. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any reclassification, stock split,
reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock
occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date hereof
and before the Effective Time.

 



 

2.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC
(or, if American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC is unavailable, with a
U.S. bank or trust company that shall be appointed by Parent (and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company) to act as a paying agent hereunder) (the "
_Paying Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of the Shares, cash in
U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration in exchange
for all of the Shares outstanding immediately before the Effective Time (other
than the Cancelled Shares), payable upon due surrender of the certificates
that immediately before the Effective Time represented Shares ("
_Certificates_ ") (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
noncertificated Shares represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ")
pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the third Business Day following the Closing Date, the
Surviving Corporation shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder
of record of Shares whose Shares were converted into the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.1_, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates
shall pass, only upon delivery of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may
mutually agree) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry
Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration.

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably required
by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates (or effective affidavits
of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
from the Exchange Fund in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product of (x) the number of Shares represented by such holders properly
surrendered Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or
Book-Entry Shares and (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment upon due surrender of the Certificate
may be paid to such a transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such
Shares is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required
to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. The Merger Consideration,
paid in full with respect to any Share in accordance with the terms hereof,
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to such Share.

 



 

(iii) Each of the Paying Agent, the Company, Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Subsidiaries or agents, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable under this Agreement such
amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect
to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or
withheld, such deducted or withheld amounts (A) shall be remitted by the
applicable entity to the appropriate Governmental Entity within the period
required under applicable Law and (B) shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

 



       
 

 



 

(c) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares that were outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation or Parent for transfer, the holder of Certificates
shall be given a copy of the letter of transmittal referred to in _Section
2.2(b)_ and instructed to comply with the instructions in that letter of
transmittal in order to receive the cash to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to this _Article II_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed
to the former holders of Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any former holders
of Shares who have not surrendered their Shares in accordance with this
_Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for
payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon, upon due surrender of their Shares.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for any
amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation
pursuant to _Section 2.2(d)_.

 



 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. In the case of any Certificate that has been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Paying Agent or Parent, the posting by such person of a bond
in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a check in the amount of the number
of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied
by the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon.

 



 

2.3 _Company Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) Immediately before the Effective Time, each share of Company Common Stock
granted subject to time-based, performance or other vesting or lapse
restrictions pursuant to any Company Stock Plan (as defined in _Section
2.3(b)_) (each, a " _Restricted Share_ "), that is outstanding and subject to
such restrictions immediately before the Effective Time shall automatically
vest and any performance conditions shall be deemed to have been satisfied in
full such that the recipient shall be entitled to 100% of the shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such performance share award, and the
Companys reacquisition right with respect to

 



      
 

 



 

each Restricted Share shall lapse, and the holder thereof shall, subject to
this _Article II_, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with
respect to each such Restricted Share.

 



 

(b) The Company shall take such action as shall be required:

 



 

(i) to cause the vesting of any unvested options to purchase Company Common
Stock (" _Company Stock Options_ ") granted under any stock option plans or
other equity-related plans of the Company (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ") to
be accelerated in full effective immediately before the Effective Time; and

 



 

(ii) to cause each outstanding Company Stock Option to represent as of the
Effective Time solely the right to receive, in accordance with this _Section
2.3_ and subject to _Section 2.2(b)(iii)_, a lump sum cash payment in the
amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any, with respect to
such Company Stock Option and to no longer represent the right to purchase
Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company, Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any other person or any other consideration.

 



 

(c) Each holder of a Company Stock Option cancelled pursuant to _Section
2.3(b)(ii)_ shall receive from Parent or the Surviving Corporation, in respect
and in consideration of each such Company Stock Option, as soon as practicable
following the Effective Time (but in any event not later than three Business
Days), an amount (net of applicable Taxes) equal to the product of (i) the
excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration per Share over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock
Option, multiplied by (ii) the total number of Shares subject to such Company
Stock Option (whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any interest
thereon (the " _Option Consideration_ "). In the event that the exercise price
of any Company Stock Option is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled, without any
consideration being payable in respect thereof, and have no further force or
effect.

 



 

(d) Following the execution of this Agreement, (i) if and as required by the
Company Stock Plans, the Company shall mail to each person who is a holder of
Company Stock Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment for
such Company Stock Options pursuant to this _Section 2.3_ and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Stock Options and
(ii) the Company shall take all actions necessary or appropriate to terminate
the Company Stock Plans as of the Effective Time (including any necessary or
appropriate action of the Company Board). Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, at all times from and after the Effective Time
maintain sufficient liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of
Company Stock Options pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

the underlying causes of such change or failure may, if they are not otherwise

account in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred); (v) any hurricane, tropical storm, flood, forest fire, earthquake
or other similar natural disaster; (vi) the execution, announcement,
performance and existence of this Agreement, including any actual or potential

were or shall be made; or omit to state any material fact necessary to correct

under the Securities Act.

 



 

(d) The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures required by Rule

files or submits under the Exchange Act, is accumulated and communicated to
the Companys management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. Since November 30, 2011, subject to any applicable grace periods,
the Company and each of its officers and directors have been in compliance in

or to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is obligated to contribute
or has any liability (such plans, programs, agreements, arrangements and
commitments, collectively, the " _Company Benefit Plans_ "). Other than the
Companys Subsidiaries, there are no other entities that together with the
Company would be treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code (each such entity, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ").

 



 

(b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, the Company has made available
to Parent and Merger Sub true, complete and correct copies of the following
(as applicable): (i) the written document evidencing such Company Benefit
Plan; (ii) any summary plan description and summaries of material
modification; (iii) any related trust agreements, insurance contracts or
documents of any other funding arrangements; (iv) all amendments,
modifications or supplements to any such document; (v) the most recent
actuarial report and financial statements, if any are required by applicable
Law; (vi) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan intended to be "qualified"
under Section 401(a) of the Code, the most recent determination letter from

IRS, including all schedules thereto; and (viii) any notices to or from the
IRS or any office or representative of the Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity relating to any compliance issues in respect of any such
Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(c) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan, except as would not be
reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect and except as
set forth on _Section 3.12(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule:

 



 

(i) each Company Benefit Plan is being and has been administered in all
material respects in accordance with ERISA, the Code and all other applicable
Laws and in all material respects in accordance with its governing documents;

 



 

(ii) no claim, lawsuit, arbitration or other action has been threatened,
asserted, instituted or, to the Companys knowledge, is anticipated against
any of the Company Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits and
appeals of such claims), any trustee or fiduciaries thereof, the Company
(including any Subsidiary thereof), any director, officer or employee thereof,
or any of the assets of any trust of any of the Company Benefit Plans;

 



 

(iii) all contributions, premiums and other payments required to be made with
respect to any Company Benefit Plan have been made on or before their due
dates under applicable Law and the terms of such Company Benefit Plan; and

 



 

(iv) all obligations of the Company, each Subsidiary and ERISA Affiliate and
each fiduciary under each Company Benefit Plan, whether arising by operation
of law or by contract, required to be performed under Section 4980B of the
Code, as amended, and Sections 601 through 609 of ERISA, or similar state Law
(" _COBRA_ "), including such obligations that may arise by virtue of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, have been or will be timely
performed in all material respects.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan that is intended to be "qualified" under Section
401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the IRS
to such effect and to the knowledge of the Company no condition exists that
could reasonably be expected to result in the revocation of any such letter.

 



 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV of ERISA and the
minimum funding standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA
has failed to meet such minimum funding standards or otherwise failed to
materially comply with Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA. The
Company has not incurred any material liability to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation (other than Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation
premiums, which have been paid when due) or otherwise under Title IV of ERISA
or under the Code that has not been satisfied in full.

 



 

(f) No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning of
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
or ERISA Affiliates has within the last six years (i) contributed to or had an
obligation to contribute to any multiemployer plan or (ii) incurred any
withdrawal liability from any multiemployer plan. Except as set forth on
_Section 3.12(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the fair market value
of the assets held under each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to Title IV
of ERISA is sufficient so as to permit a "standard termination" of each such
plan under Section 4041(b) of ERISA without the need to make any additional
contributions to such plan. With respect to each Company Benefit Plan subject
to Title IV of ERISA, the adjusted funding target attainment percentage
(within the meaning of Section 436 of the Code) for the plan year of the plan
that includes the date of this Agreement, as certified by the plans actuary,
is not less than 80%.

 



 

(g) Except with respect to the Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Section
3.12(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the execution or delivery
of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, (i)
result in any payment or benefit becoming due or payable, or required to be
provided, to any current, former or retired director, executive officer,
employee, consultant, independent contractor or other service provider of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates, (ii) increase the
amount or value of any benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required
to be provided to any such director, employee or independent contractor, (iii)
result in the acceleration of the time of payment, vesting or funding of any
such benefit or compensation or (iv) result in any amount failing to be
deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or be subject to any excise
tax imposed under Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(h) Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, neither the Company, any other "disqualified person" (as
defined in Section 4975 of the Code), any "party-in-interest" (as defined in
Section 3(14) of ERISA) and, to the knowledge of the Company, any trustee or
administrator of any Company Benefit Plan, has engaged in a nonexempt
"prohibited transaction," as defined in Section 4975 of the Code and Section
406 of ERISA, in each case, such as could reasonably be expected to give rise
to any material tax or penalty under Section 4975 of the Code or Section 406
of ERISA.

 



      
 

 



 

(i) Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect and except as set forth on _Section 3.12(i)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, no payment made or to be made in respect of any employee
or former employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would reasonably
be expected to be nondeductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

 



 

(j) Except as would not be reasonably expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect, (i) no Company Benefit Plan that provides deferred
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code has failed to either comply
with the requirements of Sections 409A(a)(2), (3), or (4) of the Code or be
operated in accordance with such requirements for the entire period; (ii) no
Company Benefit Plan has been funded in a manner described in Section 409A(b)
of the Code; and (iii) no Company Benefit Plan provides for the gross-up of
any person with respect to any failure to comply with Section 409A of the
Code.

Schedule, neither the Company nor its Subsidiaries (i) provides health or
welfare benefits for any retired or former employee or (ii) is obligated to
provide health or welfare benefits to any active employees after their
retirement or other termination of service, unless required to do so under
COBRA.

Company for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement a

Company or one of its Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and, to the knowledge
of the Company, any counterparty thereto, and is in full force and effect
except where the failure to be in full force and effect would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Companys knowledge, any other party to
any Company Material Contract is in violation of or in default under (nor does
there exist any condition that, upon the passage of time or the giving of
notice or both, would cause such a violation of or default under) any Company
Material Contract, which violation or default would reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

assets under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any Company
Material Contract.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into any
transaction after November 30, 2011 that would be subject to disclosure
pursuant to Item 404 of Regulation S-K that has not been disclosed in the

assets, free and clear of all mortgages, security interests, pledges, liens,

and marketable title in fee simple to all Owned Real Property and (ii) good
and marketable leasehold title to all Leased Real Property, in each case, free
and clear of all Liens except Permitted Liens. Except as has not had and would

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All leases of Leased Real
Property and all amendments and modifications thereto are in full force and
effect, and there exists no material default under any such lease by the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any other party thereto, nor has any event
occurred that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
material default thereunder by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any
other party thereto, except as, individually or in the aggregate, has not had

Period, the Company Board has considered in good faith any and all changes to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby offered by Parent (or
other proposals made by Parent), and has determined, after consultation

 



      
 

 



 

with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Superior
Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal even if such changes
or other proposals were to be given effect, _provided_ , that, if any material
amendment or revision is made to the Acquisition Proposal that the Company
Board has determined to be a Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required
to deliver a new written notice to Parent with respect to each successive such

communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) that has the substantive effect of
withholding, withdrawing, modifying or qualifying in any manner adverse to the
Company Recommendation shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to
be a Change of Recommendation unless the Company Board expressly publicly
reaffirms the Company Recommendation within three Business Days following any

presentations in connection with seeking any regulatory approval, exemption or
other authorization from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including all required
Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger.
Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to facilitate
obtaining any final order or orders approving such transactions, consistent
with this Agreement and/or to remove any impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company will use reasonable
best efforts to furnish all information in connection with the approvals of or
filings with any Governmental Entity and will promptly cooperate with and
furnish information in connection with any such requirements imposed upon
Parent or any of its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby. Parent and the Company shall request early
termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and use their
reasonable best efforts to cause the expiration or termination of any
applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act (the " _HSR Clearance_ "), and
shall supply to the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (" _Antitrust Division_ ") or the United States Federal Trade
Commission (" _FTC_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information or documents that may be requested pursuant to any Law or by the
Antitrust Division or the FTC.

 



 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 5.7_, each of Parent and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, Injunction or other order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that would restrain, prevent or
delay the Closing on or before the End Date.

 



 

(d) In furtherance and not limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this _Section 5.7_, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust Law so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as possible (and in any event no later
than the End Date).

 



 

(e) Parent and the Company shall cooperate and consult with each other in
connection with the making of all filings, notifications, communications,
submissions and any other material actions pursuant to this _Section 5.7_,
and, subject to applicable legal limitations and the instructions of any
Governmental Entity, Parent and the Company shall keep each other apprised on
a current basis of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
transactions contemplated thereby, including promptly furnishing the other
with copies of notices or other material communications received by Parent and
the Company, as the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect
to such transactions. Subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange of
information, Parent and the Company shall permit counsel for the other Party
reasonable opportunity to review in advance, and consider in good faith the
views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed notifications or
filings and any written communications or submissions, and with respect to any
such notification, filing, written communication or submission, any documents
submitted therewith to any Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the businesses of Parent, or proposals from third parties with respect
thereto, (ii) as necessary to

 



      
 

 



 

comply with contractual agreements and (iii) as necessary to address
reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns. Parent and the Company agree
not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person
or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the proposed
transactions unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this _Section 5.7_, " _reasonable best efforts_ " shall
include Parent proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of assets of Parent or the Company and otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing would limit Parents freedom
of action with respect to, or its ability to operate and/or retain, assets of
Parent or the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement
will require, or be deemed to require, Parent to take any action described in
this _Section 5.7(f)_ that would reasonably be expected to result in a "
_Material Adverse Effect on the Transaction_." " _Material Adverse Effect on
the Transaction_ " means a material reduction in the reasonably anticipated
economic benefits to Parent of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
measured over a commercially reasonable period.

 



 

(g) Except as otherwise permitted under this Agreement, neither Parent nor
Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Affiliates not to) take or
agree to take any action that would be reasonably likely to prevent or
materially delay the Closing.

 



 

5.8 _Public Disclosure_. Except as may be required by Law or New York Stock
Exchange rules, the press release announcing the execution of this Agreement
shall be issued only in such form as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company and Parent. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall each use
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other Parties before issuing
any other press release or otherwise making any public statement with respect
to the Merger or this Agreement (including if such public statement is
required by applicable Law or New York Stock Exchange rules). The restrictions
set forth in this _Section 5.8_ shall not apply to any communication made by
the Company regarding an Acquisition Proposal or the withholding, withdrawal
or modification of the approval or Company Recommendation with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.9 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) For a period of 18 months following the Closing Date (the " _Continuation
Period_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, provide to each individual
who, immediately before the Effective Time is an employee (including
individuals who are on a leave of absence but whose employment has not
terminated) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Covered
Employee_ "), while employed by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates after the Closing Date, (i) no
less than the same base salary or hourly wage rate provided to such Covered
Employee immediately before the Effective Time, (ii) no less than the same
short-term (annual or more frequent) bonus or commission opportunity provided
to such Covered Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (iii) other
compensation and benefits (excluding equity and equity-based awards) that are
no less favorable

 



      
 

 



 

for all Covered Employees in the aggregate as those provided to such Covered
Employees in the aggregate under the Companys and its Subsidiaries
compensation and benefit plans, programs, policies, agreements and
arrangements in effect immediately before the Effective Time. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth herein, after the Effective Time, nothing
herein shall preclude the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
from terminating the employment of any Covered Employee.

 



 

(b) Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and each of their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, honor all Company Benefit Plans
(including for the avoidance of doubt all severance, change-in-control and
similar plans and agreements) in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or termination
thereof that may be permitted by such Company Benefit Plans to the extent not
in violation of any requirements hereunder; _provided_ , _however_ , that
nothing herein shall prevent the amendment or termination of any specific
plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement, or interfere with Parents,
the Surviving Corporations or any of their respective Subsidiaries or
Affiliates rights or obligations to make such changes as are necessary to
comply with applicable Law. Parent acknowledges and agrees that the
consummation of the Merger will constitute a "Change in Control" under the
Company Benefit Plans and agreements listed in _Section 5.9(b)_ (Change-in-
Control and Severance Agreements) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. During
the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide each Covered Employee who
suffers a termination of employment under circumstances that would have given
the Covered Employee a right to severance payments and benefits under the
Companys severance policy in effect immediately before the Effective Time or,
if applicable, under the other severance arrangements under which the Covered
Employee would have received severance payments and benefits before the
Effective Time and identified on _Section 5.9(c)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (the " _Company Severance Plan_ ") with severance payments and
benefits no less favorable than those that would have been provided to such
Covered Employee under the Company Severance Plan (subject to applicable
eligibility conditions).

 



 

(c) For all purposes under (i) all employee benefit plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates
providing benefits to any Covered Employee after the Effective Time, other
than the Company Benefit Plans (the " _New Plans_ "), each Covered Employee
shall receive full credit for all purposes (including eligibility, vesting and
benefit accrual but not for benefit accrual purposes under any New Plan that
is a defined benefit plan) for such Covered Employees years of service with
the Company and its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time (including
predecessor or acquired entities or any other entities for which the Company
and its Subsidiaries have given credit for prior service) to the same extent
as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit
for such service under any similar or comparable Company Benefit Plan, or with
respect to any New Plan for which there is no similar or comparable Company
Benefit Plan, to the same extent as such service would be recognized if it had
been performed as an employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates (in each case except to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits) and (ii) the Company Benefit
Plans, each Covered Employee shall receive full credit for all purposes
(including eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) for such Covered
Employees years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries before the
Effective Time (including predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company and its Subsidiaries have given credit for
prior service), to the

 



      
 

 



 

same extent as such Covered Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time,
to credit for such service under such Company Benefit Plan (in each case
except to the extent such credit would result in a duplication of benefits).
In addition, where applicable, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing: (i) at the Effective Time, each Covered Employee immediately shall
be eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in each New Plan
applicable to the Covered Employees as of the Effective Time to the extent
such waiting time was satisfied under a similar or comparable Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee participated immediately before the
Effective Time (such plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "); (ii) Parent
shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions or limitations and actively-
at-work requirements of each New Plan applicable to the Covered Employees at
the Effective Time to be waived or satisfied for such Covered Employee and his
or her covered dependents to the extent waived or satisfied under a similar or
comparable Old Plan as of the Effective Time; (iii) Parent shall cause all
eligible expenses incurred by each Covered Employee and his or her covered
dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the
date such Covered Employees participation in the New Plan begins (if such
date is within 18 months after the Closing Date) to be taken into account
under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Covered Employees and
his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts
had been paid in accordance with such New Plan; and (iv) in all cases, all
amounts contributed as of the Closing Date by any Covered Employee to any Old
Plan that is a Code Section 125 cafeteria plan or health savings account
arrangement shall remain credited to such Covered Employees account under the
applicable plan or arrangement following the Closing Date, subject to the
terms and conditions of the applicable plan or arrangement.

 



 

(d) With respect to any accrued but unused vacation or paid time off to which
any Covered Employee is entitled pursuant to the vacation or paid time off
policy applicable to such Covered Employee immediately before the Effective
Time (the " _Vacation Policy_ "), Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to, (i)
allow such Covered Employee to use such accrued vacation or paid time off
(subject to the terms of the applicable vacation plan or policy, including any
maximums that may prohibit the Covered Employee from accruing any new vacation
or paid time off until such prior time is used) and (ii) if any Covered
Employees employment terminates during the Continuation Period under
circumstances entitling the Covered Employee to severance pay under the
Company Severance Plan, pay the Covered Employee, in cash, an amount equal to
the value of the accrued vacation or paid time off.

 



 

(e) Prior to the Closing but only after receipt of the Requisite Shareholder
Approval and the satisfaction of the condition to closing set forth in
_Section 6.1(c)_ (but earlier upon mutual agreement of the Parties), the
Company shall cooperate with Parents reasonable requests to (i) arrange and
conduct for employees of the Company, an open enrollment period for any New
Plans and employee orientation sessions (with such sessions to be held at
times reasonably agreed to by Parent and the Company), and (ii) meet with
employees of the Company (either individually or in groups) during breaks,
outside of scheduled work hours or as otherwise agreed to by Parent and the
Company.

 



 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 5.9_, whether express or implied, shall confer
upon any current or former employee of the Company, Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of

 



      
 

 



 

their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, any rights (including for sake of
clarity, any third party beneficiary rights) or remedies including any right
to employment or continued employment for any specified period, of any nature
or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.9_. No provision of
this _Section 5.9_ is intended to modify, amend or create any employee
benefit plan of the Company, Parent, Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 



 

(g) With respect to awards of Restricted Shares that the Company would have
granted on or after October 1, 2013, in the ordinary course of business in the
absence of the restrictions contained in _Section 5.1(b)_ of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) The Compensation Committee of the Company Board shall make in the ordinary
course the determinations of time-vesting awards and the performance-vesting
awards it would grant to employees of the Company for fiscal year 2014 (each
such award, a " _Company Contingent Award_ "); _provided_ , that such Company
Contingent Awards (A) may not exceed 245,000 shares of Company Common Stock in
the aggregate and (B) must be distributed among the different levels of
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries approximately in the same
proportions as awards of Restricted Shares have been distributed among the
different levels of employees of the Company in the last three fiscal years;
and

 



 

(ii) Within five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
to be granted to any Covered Employee that continues to be employed by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries on the date of grant an award of restricted shares
of Parent common stock (each, a " _Parent Award_ ") equal to the product of
(A) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company
Contingent Award for such Covered Employee, multiplied by the quotient of (I)
the closing price of a share of Company Common Stock on the New York Stock
Exchange on the last trading day prior to the Closing Date, divided by (II)
the average of the closing prices of a share of Parent common stock on the New
York Stock Exchange for the ten trading days prior to the Closing Date,
rounded up to the nearest whole share of Parent common stock; _provided_ ,
that (aa) the vesting period for such Parent Awards shall, for each Covered
Employee, be the same as the vesting period applicable to restricted stock
awards made to similarly situated employees of the Parent or its Subsidiaries
and in any event shall not provide for less favorable vesting provisions than
equal annual installment vesting beginning on the first anniversary of the
grant date over a period not longer than five years and (bb) such Parent
Awards shall be subject to the standard terms and conditions and documentation
applicable to restricted stock awards granted by Parent to employees of Parent
or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

5.10 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative (a " _Claim_ "),
including any such Claim in which any individual who is now, or has been at
any time before the date of this Agreement, or

 



      
 

 



 

who becomes before the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of
another person (the " _Indemnified Parties_ "), is, or is threatened to be,
made a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out
of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries before the Effective Time
or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the
Parties shall cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to defend
against and respond thereto. All rights to indemnification, including
advancement of expenses, and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time now existing in favor of
any Indemnified Party as provided in any applicable articles of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents), and any existing
indemnification agreements set forth on _Section 5.10(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed
or otherwise modified after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or
omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time, it being understood that
nothing in this sentence shall require any amendment to the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, and provide advancement of reasonable expenses to, each Indemnified
Party against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
Claim based in whole or in part on or arising in whole or in part out of the
fact that such person is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company, and pertaining to any matter existing or
occurring, or any acts or omissions occurring, at or before the Effective
Time, whether asserted or claimed before, or at or after, the Effective Time
(including matters, acts or omissions occurring in connection with the
approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby).

 



 

(c) Parent shall cause the individuals serving as officers and directors of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time
to be covered for a period of six years from the Effective Time by the
directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company or its Subsidiaries ( _provided_ , that Parent may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and
conditions that are not less advantageous to such officers and directors than
such policy) with respect to acts or omissions occurring before the Effective
Time that were committed by such officers and directors in their capacity as
such; _provided_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to expend
annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries for such insurance (the "
_Insurance Amount_ "), and _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is unable to maintain such policy (or such substitute
policy) as a result of the preceding proviso, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the
Insurance Amount. At the Companys option, the Company may purchase before the
Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail policy" on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to matters existing or occurring at or before the
Effective Time,

 



      
 

 



 

covering without limitation the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
that the annual premium therefor would not be in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium paid before the Effective Time. If such prepaid "tail policy"
has been obtained by the Company before the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
such policy to be maintained in full force and effect, for its full term, and
cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by the persons referred to in this
_Section 5.10_ in connection with their enforcement of their rights provided
in this _Section 5.10_.

 



 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses for acts or omissions occurring at
or before the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed before, at or after
the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or former directors,
officers or employees, as the case may be, of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles of incorporation or
bylaws or other organization documents or in any agreement shall survive the
Merger and shall continue in full force and effect. The provisions of this
_Section 5.10_ are intended to be in addition to the rights otherwise
available to the current officers and directors of the Company by Law,
charter, statute, bylaw or agreement, and shall operate for the benefit of,
and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
their Representatives. The obligations set forth in this _Section 5.10_ shall
not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in any manner that adversely
affects any Indemnified Party, or any person who is a beneficiary under the
policies referred to in this _Section 5.10_ and their heirs and
Representatives, without the prior written consent of such affected
Indemnified Party or other person.

 



 

(f) If the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their successors or
assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any other person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation
or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation
or Parent, as the case may be, shall make or cause to be made, proper
provisions so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be set forth in this _Section
5.10_.

 



 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their respective directors,
officers or other employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.10_ is not before or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

(h) The provisions of this _Section 5.10_ shall survive the Effective Time
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

 



 

5.11 _Notice of Certain Events_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall promptly advise the other of any change or event (a) having or
reasonably expected to have a

 



      
 

 



 

Company Material Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect on it, as
the case may be, or (b) that it believes would or would be reasonably likely
to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
_Section 5.11_ will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder to the Party receiving such notice or the conditions to such Partys
obligation to consummate the Merger.

 



 

5.12 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration_. Before the
Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New
York Stock Exchange and SEC to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Common Stock from the New York Stock Exchange and the
deregistration of the Common Stock under the Exchange Act as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more than 10 days
after the Closing Date.

 



 

5.13 _Control of Operations_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall give
Parent or Merger Sub, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct
the Companys operations before the Effective Time. Before the Effective Time,
the Company shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, complete control and supervision over its operations.

 



 

5.14 _Section 16 Matters_. Before the Effective Time, the Parties will each
take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or appropriate to cause any
disposition of shares of Company Common Stock or conversion of any derivative
securities in respect of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. The Company agrees to
promptly furnish to Parent all requisite information necessary for Parent to
take the actions contemplated by this _Section 5.14_.

 



 

5.15 _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to provide to
Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole expense, all cooperation reasonably
requested by Parent that is necessary in connection with obtaining financing
in connection with the Merger (so long as such cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries), including (a) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub such financial
and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably
requested by Parent, (b) participating in a reasonable number of meetings, due
diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with rating agencies in
connection with obtaining financing in connection with the Merger, (c)
assisting Parent in the preparation of customary offering memoranda, bank
information memoranda, authorization letters, confirmations and undertakings,
rating agency presentations and lender presentations relating to obtaining
financing in connection with the Merger, (d) providing and executing such
customary documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent related to
financing in connection with the Merger, (e) using reasonable best efforts to
satisfy the conditions precedent set forth in any definitive documentation
relating to financing in connection with the Merger to the extent the
satisfaction of such conditions requires the cooperation of or is within the
control of the Company, (f) using reasonable best efforts to cooperate with
the financing sources due diligence investigation, to the extent customary
and reasonable and not

 



       
 

 



 

unreasonably interfering with the business of the Company and (g) using
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters and
legal opinions reasonably requested by Parent and customary for such
financings, including issuing any customary representations letters to KPMG
LLP. Anything in this _Section 5.15_ to the contrary notwithstanding, until
the Effective Time occurs, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries,
nor any of their respective officers or directors, as the case may be, shall
(i) be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee, (ii) enter into
any definitive agreement or have any liability or any obligation under any
certificate, document, instrument, credit agreement or any related document or
any other agreement or document related to the financing in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) unless promptly
reimbursed by Parent, be required to incur any other expenses in connection
with such financing or (iv) be required to take any action in his/her capacity
as a director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such
financing. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs (including
reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or their respective Representatives in connection with their respective
obligations pursuant to, and in accordance with, this _Section 5.15_, and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives from and against any and all damages, losses,
costs, liabilities or expenses suffered or incurred by any of them in
connection with the arrangement of Parents financing and any information used
in connection therewith (other than information provided by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries) and all other actions taken by the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section
5.15_.

any representation or warranty of the Company or a failure to perform a

(h) _Parent or Merger Sub Breach_. By the Company, if there has been a breach
or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of Parent or Merger Sub or a
failure to perform a covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub

Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_).

 



 

The Party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to any clause of this
_Section 7.1_ (other than clause (a)) shall give written notice of such

shall survive any termination of this Agreement and (ii) neither the Company
nor Parent shall be relieved or released from liability for willful breach of
this Agreement or for fraud under applicable Law. Nothing shall limit or

7.1_.

 



 

7.3 _Fees and Expenses_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 7.3_, and except with respect to

whether or not the Merger is consummated.

 



 

(b) The Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee in the amount of
Seventy-Five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ")
in immediately available funds if:

 



      
 

 



 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)_,
_7.1(d)_ or _7.1(g)_ ; and (B)(1) before such termination, an Acquisition

publicly proposed or publicly disclosed; and (2) within 12 months after such
termination, the Company enters into a definitive written agreement relating
to an Acquisition Proposal or consummates a transaction contemplated by an

take action to convene the Company Shareholder Meeting and (B) within 12
months after such receipt of such Acquisition Proposal, the Company enters

The Company Termination Fee must be paid no later than two Business Days
following the event that triggers such payment described in _Section
7.3(b)(i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_. In the event that Parent shall
receive full payment of the Company Termination Fee the receipt of such amount
shall be deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates against the Company and its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective former, current or future equity
holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents,
Representatives, general or limited partners, managers, management companies,
members, shareholders, Affiliates or assignees and any and all former, current
or future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
shareholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all
former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees,
successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, " _Company
Related Parties_ "), and no Company Related Party shall have any other
liability or obligation for any or all losses or damages suffered or incurred
by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Parties in connection with
this Agreement (and the termination hereof) or any matter forming the basis
for such termination, and none of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective
Affiliates or any other Parent Related Party shall be entitled to bring or
maintain any other claim, action or proceeding against the Company, any of its
Affiliates or any other Company Related Party arising out of this Agreement,
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis
for such termination. For the avoidance of doubt (A) under no circumstances
will Parent or Merger Sub be entitled to amounts in excess of the amount of
the Company Termination Fee and (B) while Parent and Merger Sub may pursue
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 8.10_ and
the payment of the Company Termination Fee under _Section 7.3(b)_, under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in a Closing and any portion
of the Company Termination Fee. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Company be required to pay the

 



       
 

 



 

Company Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company
Termination Fee may be payable under more than one provision of this Agreement
at the same or at different times and the occurrence of different events.

 



 

(c) _Parent Termination Fee_. Parent shall pay the Company a termination fee
of Two Hundred Million Dollars ($200,000,000) (the " _Regulatory Termination
Fee_ ") if this Agreement is terminated as follows:

 



 

if (i) either Party shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)_ or _7.1(c)_ , (ii) as of the date of such termination the HSR
Clearance shall not have occurred or any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order (in each case that relates to antitrust Laws) that prevents, prohibits
or delays the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby exists or
is in effect, (iii) immediately before such termination, the conditions set
forth in _Sections 6.1(a)_ , _6.2(a)_ , _6.2(b)_ and _6.2(d)_ shall have
been satisfied and (iv) the Company shall have performed in all material
respects the obligations, and complied in all material respects with the
agreements and covenants, required to be performed by or complied with by it
under this Agreement prior to such termination, then Parent shall pay the
Regulatory Termination Fee to the Company by wire transfer of same-day funds
within two Business Days following such termination. For the avoidance of
doubt, Parent has an obligation to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee
notwithstanding that a Governmental Entity has required that Parent and/or the
Company (or any of their Subsidiaries) take one or more actions to obtain HSR
Clearance that would, if taken, constitute a Material Adverse Effect on the
Transaction.

 



 

In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the Regulatory
Termination Fee, the receipt of the Regulatory Termination Fee, together with
any indemnification or reimbursement owed pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_, shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and shareholders against Parent and Merger Sub
and each of their respective former, current or future equity holders,
controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or
limited partners, managers, management companies, members, shareholders,
Affiliates, Representatives or assignees and any and all former, current or
future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees,
agents, general or limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
shareholders, Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all
former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees,
successors or assigns of any of the foregoing, (each, a " _Parent Related
Party_ ," and collectively, the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") and no Parent
Related Party shall have any other liability or obligation for any or all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by the Company or any other Company
Related Party in connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof),
the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or any
matter forming the basis for such termination, and neither the Company nor any
other Company Related Party shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other
claim, action or proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent
Related Party arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or any matters forming the basis for such termination. For
the avoidance of doubt (1) under no circumstances will the Company be entitled
to amounts in excess of the amount of the Regulatory Termination Fee (and any
payment pursuant to _Section 7.3(d)_) and (2) while the Company may pursue
both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 8.10_ and
the payment of the Regulatory

 



      
 

 



 

Termination Fee under this _Section 7.3_, under no circumstances shall the
Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance that results in a Closing and any portion of the Regulatory
Termination Fee. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall
Parent be required to pay the Regulatory Termination Fee on more than one
occasion, whether or not the Regulatory Termination Fee may be payable under
more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at different times
and the occurrence of different events..

 



 

(d) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent, as the case may be, fails to
timely pay any amount due pursuant to this _Section 7.3_, and, in order to
obtain the payment, the Company or Parent, as the case may be, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the other Party for the payment set
forth in this _Section 7.3_, such paying Party shall pay the other Party or
Parties, as applicable, its reasonable and documented costs and expenses
(including reasonable and documented attorneys fees) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in
_The Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made through the date such payment was actually received. Other than an
order of specific performance in accordance with _Section 8.10_, and the fees
and expenses described in this _Section 7.3_, payment of the Regulatory
Termination Fee or the Company Termination Fee, as applicable, shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties in connection with any
termination of this Agreement.

 



 

7.4 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties, by action taken
or authorized by their respective boards of directors, at any time before or
after approval of the matters presented in connection with the Merger by the
shareholders of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that after any approval
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the shareholders of the
Company, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any
amendment of this Agreement (other than as contemplated by this Agreement)
that (a) alters or changes the amount or the form of the Merger Consideration
to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of Company Common Stock,
if such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any
security of the Company, (b) alters or changes any term of the articles of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, if such alteration or change would
adversely affect the holders of any security of the Company, (c) alters or
changes any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement if such alteration
or change would adversely affect the holders of any securities of the Company
or (d) by applicable Law otherwise requiring the further approval of such
shareholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties.

 



 

7.5 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Effective Time, the Parties,
by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to
the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of
the obligations or other acts of any other Party, (b) waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this
Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party, but such extension or waiver or

 



      
 

 



 

failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement
or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to,
any subsequent or other failure.

beneficiaries) and (ii) as provided in _Section 5.10_ (with respect to which
the Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries), this Agreement is
not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or remedies upon
any person other than the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, to create any agreement of employment with any person or to
otherwise create any third-party beneficiary hereto. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties in
accordance with _Section 7.5_ without notice or liability to any other
person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the Parties of risks associated
with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the Parties.
Consequently, persons other than the Parties may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

(c) No provision in this Agreement modifies or amends or creates any employee
benefit plan, program or document (" _Benefit Plan_ ") unless this Agreement
explicitly states that the provision "amends" or "creates" that Benefit Plan,
and no third party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of this
Agreement on the grounds that it is an amendment to, or a creation of, a
Benefit Plan, unless that provision explicitly states that such enforcement
rights are being conferred. This provision shall not prevent the Parties to
this Agreement from enforcing any provision of this Agreement. If a person not
entitled to enforce this Agreement brings a lawsuit or other action to enforce
any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to, or creation of a Benefit
Plan, and that provision is construed to be such an amendment or creation
despite not being explicitly designated as one in this Agreement, that
provision shall lapse retroactively, thereby precluding it from having any
effect.

 



 

(d) The Company hereby acknowledges and agrees that no Financing Source has
any liability or obligation, whether based in tort, contract or otherwise and
whether arising at law or at equity, to the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby or any financing in connection therewith. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Financing Source_ " means each person that
provides or commits to provide financing to Parent or any of its Affiliates in

 



      
 

 



 

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
respective Affiliates and Representatives of any such person. Without limiting
the foregoing, Company agrees that it will not bring any action, suit or
proceeding against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby in any forum other than any state or
federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York and any
appellate court from any thereof. The Financing Sources shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this section and _Section 8.8_ and no amendment of this
section or _Section 8.8_ shall be effective unless in writing and signed by
each party to any debt commitment letter issued in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

8.10 _Enforcement_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly
conferred upon a person will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of
any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such person, and
the exercise by a person of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of
any other remedy.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the Parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (i) the Party seeking such remedy has an adequate
remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 



 

8.11 _Disclosure Schedules_. The Company Disclosure Schedules and the Parent
Disclosure Schedules shall each be arranged in Sections corresponding to the
numbered Sections contained in this Agreement. The disclosure in any such
Section, whether related to representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements, shall qualify the corresponding Section of this Agreement. The
disclosure in any Section of this Agreement in _Article III_ or _Article IV_
shall qualify each other Section in _Article III_ or _Article IV_ to the
extent that it is reasonably apparent that such information is relevant to
such other Sections. The inclusion of any information in the Company
Disclosure Schedules or the Parent Disclosure Schedules, or in any update
thereto, shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed,
is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the ordinary course
of business.
