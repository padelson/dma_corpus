 **BACKGROUND**

 



 

WHEREAS, the parties wish to provide for a business combination transaction in
which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, (i) the Company would effect a merger pursuant to which either (A)
MergerSub will be merged with and into the Company, with the Company surviving

and into MergerSub, with MergerSub surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent, and (ii) OP MergerSub will be merged with and into the Operating
Partnership, with the Operating Partnership surviving as a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent; and

 



 

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of the Company, Parent and

Section 1.8. _Tax Treatment_. In the event that a Reverse Triangular Merger is

purchase by Parent of all of the outstanding

 



      
 

 



 

shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and OP Units, the
latter of which shall be treated as a sale of OP Units by each transferor of

the Parent as transferee of such OP Units and (b) shall prepare and file their
applicable Tax Returns based on such treatment. In the event that Forward
Triangular Merger is consummated, the parties hereto (i) intend that for

such treatment.

the right to receive the Per Share Consideration and all such OP Units, when

Merger in the same manner as provided in _Section 2.1(a)_ for other shares of
Company Common Stock.

 



 

(b) Effective immediately before the Effective Time, all vesting and other
restrictions applicable to outstanding long-term incentive plan units of

adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary and

Units or other capital stock or interest of the Company, the Operating
Partnership, the Surviving Company or the Surviving Partnership to any Person
pursuant to or in settlement of awards outstanding under the Company Incentive
Plans, including the Company Restricted Stock, and the LTIP Units.

 



 

Section 2.4. _Exchange and Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust
company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the "
_Paying Agent_ ") for the payment and delivery of the Per Share Consideration
and the Per Share Preferred Consideration, as applicable. On or before the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent cash
in an amount equal to (i) the aggregate Per Share Consideration into which the
shares of Company Common Stock and OP Units have been converted in accordance
with _Sections 2.1(a)_ and _2.2(a)_ , (ii) the aggregate Per Share Preferred
Consideration into which the Series A Preferred Stock have been converted in
accordance with _Section 2.1(d)_. The cash deposited with the Paying Agent
pursuant to this _Section 2.4(a)_ shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_." The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than
to fund payments due pursuant to _Sections 2.1(a)_ , _2.1(d)_ , _2.2(a)_ , or
_2.6_ , except as provided in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time, whether represented by stock certificates (the "
_Company Certificates_ ") or in book entry form, whose shares were converted
into the right to receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(a) _or the Per Share Preferred Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.1(d)_, (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify
the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held
by such holder and shall be in customary form), and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the shares of Company Common Stock or the
Company Preferred Stock in exchange for the Per Share Consideration or Per
Share Preferred Consideration, as applicable. Upon delivery to the Paying
Agent of such letter of transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, any
Company Certificate representing the shares held by such holder and such other
documents specified in the instructions for use referred to above as the
Paying Agent or Parent reasonably shall require, the shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock described therein shall be deemed surrendered
for cancellation and payment and the holder identified in such letter shall be
entitled promptly to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to promptly pay, the Per Share Consideration or Per Share
Preferred Consideration, as applicable, and the shares so surrendered shall be
cancelled. If a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock has occurred but has not been registered in the
transfer records of the Company, the Per Share Consideration or Per Share
Preferred Consideration applicable to those shares may be paid to the
transferee if the letter of transmittal is delivered in accordance with this
_Section 2.4(b)_, along with any Company Certificates representing such
shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, and
all documents and endorsements required to

 



      
 

 



 

evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock
transfer taxes have been paid. If any Company Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
(which affidavit shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Parent), the Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for the shares represented by
such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the Per Share Consideration
or Per Share Preferred Consideration applicable to the shares of Company
Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, represented by such
Company Certificate deliverable in respect thereof determined in accordance
with this _Article II_; _provided_ , that Parent or the Paying Agent may, in
its discretion, require the delivery of a reasonable indemnity or bond against
any claim that may be made against the Surviving Company with respect to such
Company Certificate or ownership thereof. Until surrendered as provided in
this _Section 2.4_, each share of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred
Stock shall be deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender the Per Share Consideration or Per
Share Preferred Consideration, as applicable. No interest will be paid or
accrue on any amounts payable upon surrender of any shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock.

 



 

(c) Not later than the fifth Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of an OP Unit
immediately prior to the OP Effective Time, whose OP Units were converted into
the right to receive the Per Share Consideration pursuant to _Section
2.2(a)_, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify the number of OP
Units held by such holder and shall be in customary form), and (ii)
instructions for use in effecting the delivery thereof in exchange for the Per
Share Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Agreement. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of such letter of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and upon surrender of such other
documents as may be reasonably required by the Paying Agent, the OP Units
described therein shall be deemed surrendered for cancellation and payment and
the holder identified in such letter of transmittal shall be entitled promptly
to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to
promptly pay, the Per Share Consideration. In the event of a permitted
transfer of ownership of any OP Unit which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Operating Partnership, the Per Share Consideration may be paid
to a transferee if the letter of transmittal is delivered in accordance with
this _Section 2.4(c)_ and is accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer
taxes have been paid. No interest will be paid or accrue on any amount payable
in respect of any OP Unit.

 



 

(d) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis; _provided_ , that no such investment or
losses thereon shall affect the Per Share Consideration or Per Share Preferred
Consideration, as applicable, payable to holders of Company Common Stock,
Series A Preferred Stock or OP Units entitled to receive such consideration,
and Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying Agent for the
benefit of holders of Company Common Stock, Company Preferred Stock and OP
Units in the amount of any such losses to the extent necessary for payment of
the Per Share Consideration or Per Share Preferred Consideration, as
applicable. Any interest or other income resulting from such investments shall
be paid to Parent, upon demand.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.5. _Termination of Payment Fund; Escheat_. Following the date that
is one year after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to Parent
upon demand all cash and any documents in its possession relating to the
transactions described in this Agreement, and the Paying Agents duties shall
terminate. Thereafter, any former holders of Company Common Stock, Series A
Preferred Stock or OP Units who have not previously received the Per Share
Consideration or Per Share Preferred Consideration, as applicable, to which
they are entitled under this Agreement shall look solely to Parent or to the
Surviving Company or Surviving Partnership, as applicable, for payment of such
consideration and any related amounts due to them under this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership shall be liable to a former holder of
Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock or of OP Units for any amounts
required to be delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws.

 



 

Section 2.6. _Tax Withholding_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Company, and the
Surviving Partnership shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former
holder of shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, OP Units,
or LTIP Units, such amounts as Parent, the Surviving Company or Surviving
Partnership are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code or any other provision of federal, state, local or
foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent, the
Surviving Company or Surviving Partnership, such withheld amounts (i) shall be
remitted promptly by Parent, the Surviving Company or Surviving Partnership,
as applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the former
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Preferred Stock, OP
Units, or LTIP Units in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Company or Surviving Partnership.

 



 

Section 2.7. _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares of
Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any
shares of Company Common Stock or Series A Preferred Stock are presented to
the Surviving Company, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Per Share
Consideration or Per Share Preferred Consideration in accordance with this
_Article II_. No transfers of OP Units shall be permitted after the OP
Effective Time.

 



 

Section 2.8. _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that, and only to the extent
permitted by _Section 5.1_, the Company changes (or establishes a record date
for changing) the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Series A
Preferred Stock, as applicable, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective
Time as a result of a stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
subdivision, reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, at any time during the period from
the date hereof to the Effective Time, then the Per Share Consideration or the
Per Share Preferred Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted, taking into
account the record and payment or effective dates, as the case may be, for
such transaction.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 2.9. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers of the Surviving Company and the general partner of the Surviving
Partnership will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of the Company, MergerSub, or the Operating Partnership any deeds,
bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and
on behalf of any of them, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company and the Surviving
Partnership any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Company or the Surviving Partnership as a result of, or in connection with,
the Mergers.

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 
AND THE OPERATING PARTNERSHIP**

 



 

Except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent at or prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item on the
Company Disclosure Schedule with respect to one Section of this _Article III_
shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other Sections of this _Article
III_ if the relevance of such item to such other Sections is reasonably
apparent on the face of such disclosure (it being understood that to be so
apparent it is not required that such other Sections be cross-referenced), or
as expressly disclosed in any forms, reports or documents filed by the Company
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")

and after January 1, 2011 to two (2) Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement (except for disclosure contained in any risk factors or "forward-

(a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Maryland and has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or leased
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Operating Partnership is a limited partnership duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has
the requisite organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The
Operating Partnership is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in

owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 



 

(c) Each Company Subsidiary (other than the Operating Partnership) that has
any material assets or operations is duly organized, validly existing and in
good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, and has the requisite organizational power
and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted. Each Company Subsidiary (other than the
Operating Partnership) is duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in
good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties
owned, operated or leased by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures

Effect.

 



 

(d) _Section 3.1(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true and
complete list of the Company Subsidiaries, together with (i) the jurisdiction
of incorporation or organization, as the case may be, of each Company
Subsidiary and (ii) the type of and percentage of interest held, directly or
indirectly, by the Company in such Company Subsidiary. All of the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each Company
Subsidiary have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. The Company is, directly or indirectly, the record and
beneficial owner of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each of the Company Subsidiaries and the Company owns all
such capital stock and other equity interests free and clear of any Liens
(other than Permitted Liens) or limitations on voting rights, and free of any
preemptive rights or any other limitation or restriction (including any
limitation or restriction on the right to vote, sell, transfer or otherwise
dispose of the stock or other ownership interests).

 



 

(e) None of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary directly or indirectly owns any interest or investment (whether
equity or debt) in any Person (other than in the Operating Partnership or in
any other Company Subsidiaries and other than investments in short-term
investment securities or securities of a publicly traded company held for
investment by the Company or any of its subsidiaries and consisting of less
than 3% of the outstanding capital stock of such company).

 



 

Section 3.2. _Organizational Documents_. The Company and the Operating
Partnership have made available to Parent complete and correct copies of (i)
the Companys charter (the " _Charter_ ") and Bylaws, and (ii) the Operating
Partnerships Certificate of Limited Partnership (the " _OP Certificate_ ")
and the Operating Partnership Agreement, each as in effect on the date hereof.

 



 

Section 3.3. _Capital Structure_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 200,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _Company Preferred Stock_ "), of which 2,990,000 shares
of Company Preferred

 



      
 

 



 

Stock have been classified and designated as 8.500% Series A Cumulative
Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, having a liquidation preference of
$25.00 per share (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_" and, together with the
Company Common Stock, the " _Company Stock_ "). At the close of business on
December 22, 2011, (i) 51,133,730 shares of Company Common Stock were issued
and outstanding, including 521,610 shares of Company Restricted Stock that at
that date were subject to restrictions imposed in connection with restricted
stock grants made under the Companys 2005 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan (the
" _Company 2005 Incentive Plan_ ") or the Companys 2010 Long Term Incentive
Compensation Plan (the " _Company 2010 Incentive Plan_ ", and together with
the Company 2005 Incentive Plan, the " _Company Incentive Plans_ "), (ii) no
shares of Company Common Stock were held by the Company in treasury, (iii)
2,940,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding, and
(iv) 7,494,793 shares of Company Common Stock were available for issuance upon
redemption of units of limited partnership interest in the Operating
Partnership (each an " _OP Unit_ "), including OP Units issuable upon
conversion of LTIP Units. Such issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock
have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and
nonassessable. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter on which
holders of shares of Company Stock may vote. _Section 3.3(a) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true and complete list setting forth, as of
the date hereof, all outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock, the names
of the holders thereof, the date each such share of Company Restricted Stock
was granted, any vesting schedule with respect to the outstanding shares of
Company Restricted Stock and whether the holder of Company Restricted Stock
timely made an election under Section 83(b) of the Code to include in income
the value of the Company Restricted Stock on the date such Company Restricted
Stock was granted to the holder. Each share of Company Restricted Stock was
granted in compliance with all applicable Laws and all of the terms and
conditions of the Company Incentive Plans pursuant to which it was issued.

 



 

(b) The Operating Partnership is authorized under the Operating Partnership
Agreement to issue three classes of units of limited partnership interest,
which are the OP Units, LTIP Units, and the Series A Preferred Partnership
Units (each, a " _Series A Preferred Partnership Unit_"). At the close of

outstanding, (ii) 361,890 LTIP Units were issued and outstanding, and (iii)

general partner of the Operating Partnership is CS Business Trust I, a
Maryland business trust which is a Company Subsidiary that is wholly-owned by
the Company. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each OP Unit will be
redeemable for not more than one share of Company Common Stock. _Section
3.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true and complete list
setting forth, as of the date hereof, all outstanding LTIP Units, the names of
the holders thereof, the date each such LTIP Unit was granted, any vesting
schedule with respect to the outstanding LTIP Units. Each LTIP Unit was

Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of (i) any Law
applicable to the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary is bound (except for Laws with

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary nor any director, officer, agent, employee or Affiliate of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is aware of any action, or any allegation of
any action, or has taken any action, directly or indirectly, (i) that would
constitute a violation in any material respect by such Persons of the Foreign

thereunder the (" _FCPA_ "), including making use of the mails or any means or
instrumentality of

office, in contravention of the FCPA, or (ii) that would constitute an offer
to pay, a promise to pay or a payment of money or anything else of value, or
an authorization of such offer, promise or payment, directly or indirectly, to
any employee, agent or representative of another company or entity in the

in order to induce such Person to act against the interest of his or her
employer or principal.

 



 

Section 3.7. _SEC Filings; Financial Statements_.

 



 

(a) The Company has filed with the SEC all forms, reports, and documents
required to be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, since January 1, 2009 (collectively, the " _Company SEC
Filings_ "). Each Company SEC Filing, as amended or supplemented, if
applicable, (i) as of its date, or, if amended or supplemented, as of the date
of the most recent amendment or supplement thereto, complied as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed (or became
effective in the case of registration statements), or, if amended or
supplemented, as of the date of the most recent amendment or supplement
thereto, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, neither the
Operating Partnership nor any other Company Subsidiary is separately subject
to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. To the knowledge
of the Company, there are no material unresolved comments received from the
SEC staff with respect to the Company SEC Filings on or prior to the date
hereof. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Filings filed
on or prior to the date hereof is subject to ongoing SEC review or
investigation.

 



 

(b) Each of the consolidated financial statements contained in the Company SEC
Filings (as amended, supplemented or restated, if applicable, prior to the
date hereof) was prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States (" _GAAP_ ") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated (except as indicated in the notes thereto),
and each such consolidated financial statement presented fairly, in all
material respects, the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the
respective dates thereof and for the respective periods indicated therein
(subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly financial statements, to normal
year-end adjustments).

 



 

(c) There are no material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely
affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data. The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls
and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company required
to be included in reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its
consolidated subsidiaries, is

 



      
 

 



 

made known to the Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer by others within those entities, particularly during the
periods in which the periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are
being prepared, and, to the knowledge of the Company, such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to information required
to be included in the Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange
Act. Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, none of the
Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary has made
any prohibited loans to any director or executive officer of the Company (as
defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act). The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with (i) the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and (ii) the rules and regulations of the NYSE that are applicable to the
Company.

 



 

(d) None of the Company or its consolidated subsidiaries has any material
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) that would be required to be reflected or reserved
against on a balance sheet prepared in accordance with GAAP, except for
liabilities or obligations (i) incurred in connection with the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated hereby, including the Erdman Sale, (ii)
reflected on or reserved against in the Companys consolidated balance sheet,
as of September 30, 2011, included in the Companys consolidated financial
statements, or (iii) incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice since September 30, 2011.

 



 

(e) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar contract (including any contract or arrangement relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company and any Company
Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any
structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on
the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item
303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Securities Act), where the result, purpose or
effect of such contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any Company Subsidiary
in the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries published financial statements
or any Company SEC Filings.

 



 

(f) A schedule of the outstanding Indebtedness of the Company, the Operating
Partnership and the Company Subsidiaries, other than outstanding checks, as of
the dates set forth therein is set forth in _Section 3.7(f) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_.

 



 

Section 3.8. _Disclosure Documents_.

 



 

(a) The information to be supplied by the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the proxy statement to be furnished to the
holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger (the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") will not, at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the
holders of Company Common Stock (the date on which the Proxy Statement is so
mailed, the " _Proxy Mail Date_ ") or at the time of the Company Stockholder
Approval, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The representations and warranties contained in this _Section 3.8_ will
not apply to statements or omissions included in the Proxy Statement based
upon information supplied to the Company by or on behalf of any Purchaser
Party.

 



 

Section 3.9. _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2010,
except as contemplated by or as disclosed pursuant to this Agreement, (i) the
Company has conducted its business in all material respects in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) there has not been
(x) any Company Material Adverse Effect or any effect, event, development or
circumstance that, individually or in the aggregate with all other effects,
events, developments and changes, has had or would reasonably be expected to
result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, or (y) any action taken by the
Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary through the
date of this Agreement that, if taken during the period from the date of this
Agreement through the Effective Time, would constitute a breach of _Sections
5.1(c)(i)_, _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(v)_ , _(vii)_ , _(viii)_ , _(ix)_ , _(x)_ ,
_(xi)_ , _(xii)_ , or _(xvi)(A)_ , _(xvi)(B)_ , _(xvi)(C)_ , _(xvi)(E)_ ,

Section 3.10. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Section 3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a true
and complete list of each material Company Benefit Plan and separately
identifies each Erdman Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Plan that could
be subject to Code Section 409A. " _Company Benefit Plan_ " means any
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") other than a "multi-
employer plan" (as described in ERISA Section 3(37)), and any other material
plan, program, policy or agreement (whether written or oral) providing
compensation or other benefits to any current or former trustee, director,
officer, or employee of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other
Company Subsidiary (or to any dependent or beneficiary thereof), which are
maintained, sponsored or contributed to (or with respect to which any
obligation to contribute has been undertaken) by the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary, or under which the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary has any material
obligation or liability, contingent or otherwise, including all individual
employment, severance, consulting, change of control, retention, or similar
arrangements and incentive, bonus, deferred compensation, cafeteria, medical,
disability, stock purchase or equity based compensation plans, policies or
programs. The Company has provided or made available to the Parent or its
counsel with respect to each and every Company Benefit Plan (other than a
multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) (a " _Multiemployer
Plan_ ")) a true and complete copy of all plan documents, if any, including
related trust agreements, funding arrangements, and insurance contracts and
all amendments thereto; and, to the extent applicable, (i) the most recent
determination letter, if any, received by the Company, the Operating
Partnership, or any other Company Subsidiary from the IRS regarding the Tax-
qualified status of such Company Benefit Plan; (ii) the most recent financial
statements for such Company Benefit Plan; (iii) the most recent actuarial

(b) Each Company Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) has been
established, administered, and funded in all material respects in accordance
with its terms, the terms of any applicable collective bargaining agreement
and all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code. The Company and any
applicable Company Subsidiary have timely satisfied all contribution
requirements set forth in any applicable collective bargaining agreement
related to any applicable Company Benefit Plan, except for circumstances that
will not result in any material liability to the Company or any applicable
Company Subsidiary. There has been no amendment to, announcement by the
Company, the Operating Partnership, or any Company Subsidiary relating to, or
change in employee participation or coverage under, any Company Benefit Plan
which would increase materially the expense of maintaining such plan above the
level of the expense incurred therefor for the most recent fiscal year.

 



 

(c) Each Company Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) which is
intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has either received a
favorable determination letter from the United States Internal Revenue Service
(the " _IRS_ ") as to its qualified status or may rely upon an opinion letter
for a prototype plan and, to the Companys knowledge, no fact or event has
occurred that would adversely affect the qualified status of any such Company
Benefit Plan. To the Companys knowledge, none of the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary has engaged in a non-exempt
prohibited transaction (within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code) with respect to any Company Benefit Plan that could result
in material liability to the Company, the Operating Partnership and the other
Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No material suit, administrative
proceeding, action or other litigation has been brought, or to the knowledge
of the Company, is threatened against or with respect to any such Company
Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan), including any audit or inquiry
by the IRS or United States Department of Labor (other than routine benefits
claims).

 



 

(d) (i) No Company Benefit Plan is, and none of the Company, the Operating
Partnership, any Company Subsidiaries or any corporation, trade, business, or
entity under common control with the Company, the Operating Partnership or any
other Company Subsidiary within the meaning of Section 414(b), (c), (m), or
(o) of the Code or Section 4001 of ERISA (each, an " _ERISA Affiliate_ ")
maintains, contributes to, or participates in, or has ever during the past six
(6) years maintained, contributed to, or participated in, or otherwise has any
obligation or liability in connection with, a Multiemployer Plan, a "multiple
employer welfare arrangement" (as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA), a
"multiple employer plan" (as defined in Section 413(c) of the Code) or a
pension plan subject to Section 412 or 4971of the Code or Section 302 or Title
IV of ERISA. (ii) None of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other
Company Subsidiary has any liability under Title IV of ERISA, and no condition
exists that presents a material risk to the Company, the Operating Partnership
or any other Company Subsidiary of incurring or being subject to a material
liability under Title IV of ERISA. (iii) With respect to any Multiemployer
Plan contributed to by the Company, the Operating Partnership, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate, none of the Company, the Operating
Partnership, any other Company Subsidiary, or any ERISA Affiliate has incurred
any withdrawal liability under Title IV of ERISA which remains unsatisfied.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) No Company Benefit Plan provides any post-employment medical or life
insurance benefits, other than coverage mandated by Part 6 of Title I of ERISA
or Code Section 4980B or similar state law.

 



 

(f) (i) None of the Surviving Company or any of its respective subsidiaries
will be required to make any material payment to any employee in connection
with any Company Benefit Plan solely as a result of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. (ii) Neither the execution and
delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (either alone or in combination with another event)
(a) result in the payment of any amount that would, individually or in
combination with any other such payment, not be deductible as a result of
Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code; (b) result in any current or
former employee, or director of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any
Company Subsidiary being entitled to severance pay or any increase in
severance pay upon any termination of employment (whether before or after the
date of this Agreement); (c) limit or restrict the right of the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any Company Subsidiary to merge, amend or terminate
any Company Benefit Plan; or (d) accelerate the time of payment or vesting, or
result in any payment or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of any
compensation or benefits under, or increase the amount of compensation or
benefits due under, any Company Benefit Plan.

 



 

(g) There are no material funded benefit obligations of the Company, the
Operating Partnership or the other Company Subsidiaries under a Company
Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan) for which contributions have
not been made or properly accrued and there are no material unfunded benefit
obligations under a Company Benefit Plan (other than any Multiemployer Plan)
that have not been accounted for by reserves or otherwise reflected as may be
required in the consolidated financial statements in the Company SEC Filings.

 



 

(h) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby will cause Parent or its Affiliates to
assume or incur any liabilities under, or with respect to, the Erdman Benefit
Plans.

 



 

Section 3.11. _Labor and Other Employment Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

and conditions of employment, workers compensation, occupational safety,
plant closings, collective bargaining, employment discrimination, civil

Disclosure Schedule_, as of the date of this Agreement, neither the Company,
the Operating Partnership nor any Company Subsidiary is involved (either as
principal, general contractor, subcontractor, construction manager, design-
builder, service provider, advisor or otherwise) in any Project which has not
been substantially completed, either with respect to any Company Property or
otherwise.

 



 

(s) To the knowledge of the Company, (i) each Company Property is in good
operating condition and repair and is structurally sound and free of latent or
patent structural, mechanical or other significant defects (excluding ordinary
course wear and tear and repairs and alterations provided for in the Companys
budgets which have been disclosed to Parent), (ii) no Company Property has
suffered any uninsured casualty or other damage that has not been repaired or
is not contemplated to be repaired with funds allocated for such purpose in
the Companys budgets which have been disclosed to Parent, and (iii) each
Company Property is otherwise adequate in all material respects for its
current use, operation and occupancy, except, in each of cases (i), (ii) and
(iii), where any failure would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 3.17. _Taxes_.

 



 

(a) The Company, the Operating Partnership and each other Company Subsidiary
has timely filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity all Tax Returns
required to be filed, taking into account any extensions of time within which
to file such Tax Returns, and all such Tax Returns were complete and correct,
subject in each case to such exceptions as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
All Taxes due and owing by the Company, the Operating Partnership and each
other Company Subsidiary (whether or not shown on any Tax Return) have been
paid, other than those which, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The Company (i) for all taxable years commencing with the Companys
taxable year ended December 31, 2005 through December 31, 2010, has been
subject to taxation as a real estate investment trust within the meaning of
Section 856 of the Code (a " _REIT_ ") and has satisfied all requirements to
qualify as a REIT for such years; (ii) has operated since January 1, 2011 to
the date hereof in a manner consistent with the requirements for qualification
and taxation as a REIT; and (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a
manner as to qualify as a REIT for its taxable year that will end with the
Merger. No Company Subsidiary is a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, other than a corporation that qualifies as a "qualified REIT
subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(i)(2) of the Code, or as a
"taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l) of the Code.

 



 

(c) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect: (i) there are no audits,
investigations by any Governmental Entity or other proceedings pending with
regard to any material Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary; (ii) no deficiency for Taxes of
the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary has
been claimed, proposed or assessed in writing or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, by any Governmental Entity, which deficiency has not yet
been settled,

 



      
 

 



 

except for such deficiencies which are being contested in good faith; (iii)
none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary
has waived any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to any
extension of time with respect to any Tax assessment or deficiency for any
open tax year; (iv) none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of
the other Company Subsidiaries has entered into any "closing agreement" as
described in Section 7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar
provision of state, local or foreign income Tax Law); and (v) no power of
attorney with respect to any Tax matter is currently in force with respect to
the Company, the Operating Partnership or any of the other Company
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) The Operating Partnership and each other Company Subsidiary that is a
partnership, joint venture, or limited liability company and which has not
elected to be a "taxable REIT subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 856(l)
of the Code has been since its formation treated for U.S. federal income tax
purposes as a partnership or disregarded entity, as the case may be, and not
as a corporation or an association taxable as a corporation.

 



 

(e) None of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary holds any asset the disposition of which would be subject to rules
similar to Section 1374 of the Code.

 



 

(f) Since its inception, (i) each of the Company, the Operating Partnership

Taxes under Section 860(c) or 4981 of the Code which have not been previously
paid, and (ii) none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other
Company Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes that have
become due and that have not been previously paid other than in the ordinary
course of business or Taxes arising out of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. To the knowledge of the Company, none of the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary has engaged in any
transaction that would give rise to "redetermined rents, redetermined
deductions and excess interest" described in Section 857(b)(7) of the Code.

 



 

(g) The Company, the Operating Partnership and the other Company Subsidiaries
have complied, in all material respects, with all applicable Laws, rules and
regulations relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including
withholding of Taxes pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 1445, 1446 and 3402 of
the Code or similar provisions under any foreign Laws) and have duly and
timely withheld and have paid over to the appropriate taxing authorities all
material amounts required to be so withheld and paid over on or prior to the
due date thereof under all applicable Laws.

 



 

(h) To the knowledge of the Company, no claim has been made in writing by a
taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that the
Company, the Operating Partnership or any such other Company Subsidiary is or
may be subject to taxation by that jurisdiction.

 



 

(i) None of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary (i) is or has ever been a member of an affiliated group (other than
a group the common parent of which is a directly or indirectly wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company or the Operating Partnership) filing a consolidated
federal income tax return, and (ii) has any

 



      
 

 



 

liability for the Taxes of another Person other than the Company, the
Operating Partnership and the other Company Subsidiaries under Treasury
Regulation 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law),
as a transferee or successor or by contract.

 



 

(j) The Tax Protection Agreements listed in _Section 3.17(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule_ are the only such agreements in force at the date of this
Agreement, and, as of the date of this Agreement, no Person has raised in
writing, or to the knowledge of the Company threatened to raise, a material
claim against the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary for any breach of any Tax Protection Agreements. True, correct and
complete copies of all such Tax Protection Agreements have been made available
to Parent. As used herein, " _Tax Protection Agreements_ " means any written
agreement to which the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other Company
Subsidiary is a party pursuant to which: (i) any liability to holders of OP
Units relating to Taxes may arise, whether or not as a result of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in
connection with the deferral of income Taxes of a holder of OP Units, the
Company, the Operating Partnership or the other Company Subsidiaries have
agreed to (A) maintain a minimum level of Indebtedness or continue any
particular Indebtedness, (B) retain or not dispose of assets for a period of
time that has not since expired, (C) make or refrain from making Tax
elections, and/or (D) only dispose of assets in a particular manner; and/or
(iii) limited partners of the Operating Partnership have guaranteed
Indebtedness of the Operating Partnership.

 



 

(k) There are no Tax Liens upon any property or assets of the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary except Liens for Taxes
not yet due and payable or that are being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate reserves have been established.

 



 

(l) None of the Company, the Operating Partnership and each other Company
Subsidiary has any permanent establishment in any country other than its
country of organization.

 



 

(m) Each of the Company, the Operating Partnership and the other Company
Subsidiaries (i) believes it has substantial authority for or (ii) has
disclosed on its Tax Returns all positions taken on such Tax Returns that
could give rise to a substantial understatement of Tax within the meaning of
Section 6662 of the Code or any similar provision of applicable state Laws,
and is in possession of supporting documentation as may be required with
respect to any such disclosure. The Company, the Operating Partnership and the
other Company Subsidiaries have not participated in any transaction that could
give rise to a disclosure obligation as a "listed transaction" under Section
6011 of the Code and the regulations thereunder or any similar provision under
applicable Laws.

of the Company and the Operating Partnership with respect to Tax matters.

for any or all Company Properties or that are otherwise material

 



      
 

 



 

to the operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole. Except for those matters that have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, at the date of this
Agreement, there is no claim for coverage by the Company, the Operating
Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary pending under any of the Insurance
Policies that has been denied or disputed by the insurer. Except for those
matters that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, all premiums payable under all Insurance
Policies have been paid, each of the Company, the Operating Partnership and
the other Company Subsidiaries has otherwise complied in all material respects
with the terms and conditions of all the Insurance Policies, and, as of the
date of this Agreement, none of the Company, the Operating Partnership or the
other Company Subsidiaries has received written notice from any insurance
carrier suspending, revoking or canceling (or threatening to take such action)
any material Insurance Policy, which has not been replaced on substantially
similar terms prior to the date of such suspension, revocation or
cancellation. To the knowledge of the Company, such Insurance Policies are
valid and enforceable in accordance with their terms and are in full force and
effect.

 **ARTICLE IV**

 



 

 **REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER PARTIES**

 



 

Except as expressly disclosed in any forms, reports or documents filed by
Parent with the SEC under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act from and
after January 1, 2011 to two (2) Business Days prior to the date of this
Agreement (except for disclosure contained in any risk factors or "forward-
looking statements" specifically identified in such forms, reports or
documents as such), each Purchaser Party jointly and severally represents and
warrants to the Company and the Operating Partnership as follows:

 



 

Section 4.1. _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries_.

 



 

(a) Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware and has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Parent is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or leased
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) MergerSub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Maryland and has the requisite
organizational power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. MergerSub is duly
qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or leased
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the
Closing, MergerSub may form a wholly-owned subsidiary that is a limited
liability company, which may be assigned the rights and assume the obligations
of MergerSub contained in this Agreement, and MergerSub may merge with and
into such limited liability company (with the limited liability company
surviving the merger). Thereafter, all references to "MergerSub" shall be
deemed to be references to such limited liability company and all provisions
applicable to MergerSub shall be deemed to be applicable to such limited
liability company _mutatis mutandis_ to take into account that MergerSub is a
limited liability company instead of a corporation.

 



 

(c) OP MergerSub is a limited liability company duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware, and has
the requisite

and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. OP MergerSub is
duly qualified or licensed to do business, and is in good standing, in each
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, operated or leased
by it or the nature of its business makes such qualification, licensing or
good standing necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.2. _Organizational Documents_. Parent, MergerSub and OP MergerSub
have made available to the Company complete and correct copies of (i) Parents
Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Parent Charter_ ") and Parents Bylaws

") and MergerSubs Bylaws (the " _MergerSub Bylaws_ "), and (iii) OP

contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary
corporate or partnership action, and no other corporate or partnership
proceedings on the part of any Purchaser Party are necessary to authorize this
Agreement or the Merger or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by each Purchaser
Party and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Company
and the Operating Partnership, constitutes a legally valid and binding

Purchaser Party in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, preference,
fraudulent transfer, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or affecting
the rights and remedies of creditors and by general principles of equity
regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or
at Law.

 



 

Section 4.4. _No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 



 

(a) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Purchaser Party does
not, and the performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby by each Purchaser Party will

Parent Bylaws, the MergerSub Charter, the MergerSub Bylaws, the OP MergerSub
Certificate, the OP MergerSub Partnership Agreement or any equivalent
organizational documents of any other Parent Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that
all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits described in _Section
4.4(b)_ have been obtained, all filings and notifications described in
_Section 4.4(b)_ have been made and any waiting periods thereunder have
terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to Parent,

property or asset of Parent, MergerSub, OP MergerSub or any other Parent
Subsidiary is bound, or (iii) require any consent, approval or notice under,

triggering of any payments pursuant to, or constitute a change of control or
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or give to others any right of termination, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property or asset
of Parent, MergerSub, OP MergerSub or any other Parent Subsidiary pursuant to,
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, license,
permit or other legally binding obligation to which Parent, MergerSub, OP
MergerSub or any other Parent Subsidiary is a party, except, as to clauses
(ii) and (iii), respectively, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences which would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each Purchaser Party does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by each Purchaser Party will not,

for record of the Merger Filing, as required by the MGCL, and the Partnership
Merger Filing, as required by the DRULPA and (ii) where failure to obtain such
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

Section 4.5. _Disclosure Documents_.

 



 

(a) The information to be supplied by or on behalf of Parent for inclusion or
incorporation in the Proxy Statement (as supplemented and amended) will not,
at the time the Proxy Statement is first mailed to the Companys stockholders,
at the time of the Company Stockholder Approval, contain any untrue statement
of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

Party, threatened by any third party or before any Governmental Entity, nor,
to the knowledge of each Purchaser Party, is there any investigation pending
by any Governmental Entity, in each case against Parent, MergerSub, OP
MergerSub or any other Parent Subsidiary, and none of Parent, MergerSub, OP
MergerSub or any other Parent Subsidiary is subject to any outstanding
judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any Governmental Entity, in
each case, that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be

subsidiaries, if any, to use its reasonable best efforts to take all actions
and to do all things necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Laws to consummate the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, but subject to
Parents right to extend the Closing pursuant to the proviso set forth in the
first sentence of _Section 1.4_, including using its reasonable efforts to

parties hereto shall furnish to each other party such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing. The parties shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to resist, contest or defend any suit, claim, action
or proceeding (including administrative or judicial actions and proceedings)
challenging the Mergers or the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep each other reasonably apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other written communications received by the Company or Parent, as
the case may be, or any of their respective subsidiaries, from any
Governmental Entity and/or third party with respect to such transactions, and,
to the extent practicable under the circumstances, shall provide the other
party and its counsel with the opportunity to participate in any meeting with
any Governmental Entity in respect of any filing, investigation or other

Section 5.3. _Preparation of Proxy Statement_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable, and in no event later than twenty (20)
Business Days following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare
and file the Proxy Statement with the SEC. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as
promptly as practicable. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the holders of Company Common Stock as promptly as practicable, but
in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the earlier of (i)
clearance by the SEC of the Proxy Statement and (ii) the conclusion of any SEC
review of the Proxy Statement (the " _SEC Approval_ ").

 



 

(b) The Company will advise Parent, as promptly as practicable after it
receives notice hereof, of any request by the SEC to amend the Proxy Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. If, at any time before the Effective Time, either
Parent or the Company discovers or determines that any information relating to
that party or its Affiliates should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to the Proxy Statement in order to comply with applicable Law or in order that
any such document would not include any material misstatement of a material
fact or omit to state

 



      
 

 



 

any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not material, the party making that
discovery or determination shall notify the other and, to the extent required
by Law, the parties shall cause an appropriate amendment or supplement
addressing such information to be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the
extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company. All
filings by the Company with the SEC in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Proxy Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto and all mailings to the Companys stockholders in
connection with the Merger and transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be subject to the reasonable prior review and comment of Parent.

 



 

Section 5.4. _Meeting of Stockholders_. The Company shall, in accordance with
applicable Law and its Charter and Bylaws, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, duly call and give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the
holders of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") (but
in no event shall such meeting be held later than forty-five (45) days
following the effectiveness of the SEC Approval, except to the extent the
meeting is required to be delayed in order to allow the Company, upon the
recommendation of outside legal counsel, to prepare, file and distribute a
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement to the holders of Company
Common Stock to reflect developments occurring after the date the Proxy
Statement is mailed to such holders), and shall hold a vote of the holders of
Company Common Stock, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval. Unless the Companys Board of Directors shall have made an Adverse
Recommendation Change in accordance with this Agreement, the Company shall
include in the Proxy Statement the recommendation of its Board of Directors in
favor of the Company Stockholder Approval (the " _Recommendation_ ") and shall
use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain the Company Stockholder
Approval. At the Company Stockholders Meeting, Parent shall cause all shares
of Company Common Stock then owned by Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries
to be voted in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the
Merger. At any time before the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained,
the Companys Board of Directors may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
only if the Companys Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
taking into account the advice of the Companys outside legal counsel, that
the failure to withdraw or modify the Recommendation would be reasonably
likely to constitute a breach of the duties of the Companys directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law. The Company shall not be required
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting if this Agreement is validly
terminated before the meeting is held.

 



 

Section 5.5. _Public Statements_. Each of the Company, Parent and MergerSub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions

be required by applicable Law or any applicable rules or regulations of any
United States securities exchange, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at
the final discretion of the disclosing party; provided, however, that upon
prior consultation with the other party, each of the parties may make
statements that are not inconsistent with

 



      
 

 



 

previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements made by any
of the parties in compliance with this _Section 5.5_.

 



 

Section 5.6. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

records, and, during such period, shall furnish reasonably promptly to Parent
(i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by the Company, the Operating Partnership or any Company Subsidiary
during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities
Laws, and (ii) all other information (financial or otherwise) concerning its
business, properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Person shall be required by this _Section
5.6_ to provide Parent or its Representatives with (x) access to physical
properties for the purpose of invasive physical testing, or (y) any
information that the Company reasonably believes may not be provided to Parent
by reason of applicable Law which constitutes information protected by
attorney/client privilege, or which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
required to keep confidential by reason of contract, agreement or
understanding with third parties (it being understood that the Company shall,
and shall cause each relevant Company Subsidiary to, use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain any and all consents of such third parties as shall be
necessary to permit such information to be disclosed to Parent and its
Representatives. Neither Parent nor its Representatives, in the exercise of
the rights described in this _Section 5.6_, shall unduly interfere with the
operation of the business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. No
investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ or information provided, made
available or delivered to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ or otherwise
shall affect any representations or warranties of the Company or conditions or
rights of Parent contained in this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Each of the Purchaser Parties will hold, and will cause its respective
Representatives to hold, any non-public information in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, and will otherwise comply with the
terms of the letter agreement between the Company and Parent dated as of
November 18, 2011 (as amended, through the date hereof, and as further amended
from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

 



 

(c) Subject to applicable Law and legal process, the Company and the Operating
Partnership shall and shall cause each of the other Company Subsidiaries and
all of their respective Representatives to hold all non-public information
received concerning the business and affairs of Parent in strict confidence.

cooperate with Parent in connection with, any litigation or claim against the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and/or its directors or officers relating to
the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
provided, however, that no settlement in connection with such

 



      
 

 



 

litigation shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

Section 5.8. _Acquisition Proposals_.

 



 

(a) As used in this Agreement:

 



 

" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer, whether in one
transaction or a series of related transactions (i) for a merger,
consolidation, share or equity interest exchange, dissolution,
recapitalization or other business combination to which the Company, the

"significant subsidiary" (as defined in Rule 1-02 of Regulation S-X, but
substituting 25% for references to 10% therein) is a constituent party, (ii)
for the issuance, sale or other disposition by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary (including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any
similar transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase,
or securities convertible into, such securities) representing 25% or more of
the outstanding voting interests in the Company, the Operating Partnership or
any Company Subsidiary, (iii) for the sale or other disposition, directly or
indirectly, by merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar

Subsidiary) of the Company, the Operating Partnership or the Company
Subsidiaries representing 25% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (iv) tender offer or exchange offer in
which any Person or "group" (as such term is defined under the Exchange Act)
offers to acquire beneficial ownership, or the right to acquire beneficial
ownership, of 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or
(v) transaction which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing transactions, in each case other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or the Erdman Purchase Agreement; and

 



 

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (but replacing references to "25% or more" in the definition of
Acquisition Proposal with "more than 50%") received after the date of this
Agreement that is made by a third party (and not obtained in breach of this
Agreement, including this _Section 5.8_) on terms that the Companys Board of
Directors determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys
outside counsel and financial advisor to be more favorable to the stockholders
of the Company than the Merger taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any proposal by
Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement, and including in each case the
risks, probabilities and timing of consummation) and which the Companys Board
of Directors determines in good faith is reasonably likely to be consummated
and for which financing, if a transaction involving cash consideration
(whether in whole or in part), is then fully committed or reasonably
determined to be available by the Companys Board of Directors and which is
not subject to any condition to consummation based on the availability of
financing.

 



 

(b) (i) Subject to the other provisions of this _Section 5.8_, until the
Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with _Article VII_, none of the Company, the Operating Partnership, or the
other Company Subsidiaries shall, and they shall use reasonable best efforts
to cause their respective officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents,
advisors and other representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or encourage (including by way of
providing non-public

 



      
 

 



 

information) the submission of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiries,
proposals or offers that reasonably may be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect
thereto or otherwise cooperate with or assist or participate in, or facilitate
any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations, or (ii) approve,
adopt or recommend, or propose to approve, adopt or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, letter of intent, agreement in
principle, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or share
exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar agreement providing for
or relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or enter into any agreement or
agreement in principle requiring the Company or the Operating Partnership to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Mergers or breach its obligations
hereunder, or propose or agree to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, none of the Company, the
Operating Partnership, or the other Company Subsidiaries shall, and they shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause their respective officers, directors,
employees, consultants, agents, advisors and other representatives not to,
directly or indirectly, terminate, amend or modify, or fail to enforce, or
grant any waiver under, any standstill or similar agreement with any Person
(other than Parent), except where contractually obligated to do so in
accordance with the terms of any standstill or similar agreement to which any
of them is a party as of the date hereof. The Company and the Operating

representative of any of the foregoing to, (A) immediately cease any
discussions, negotiations, or communications with any party with respect to
any Acquisition Proposal, and (B) promptly request that all Persons with which

Subsidiaries, or any Representatives thereof.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
until the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, if the Company has
received from a third party an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this _Section 5.8_ and that the Companys
Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside counsel and financial advisor) constitutes or is reasonably
likely to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may (A) furnish
information with respect to the Company, the Operating Partnership and the
other Company Subsidiaries to the Person making the Acquisition Proposal
(pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement substantially similar to
and not less favorable to the Company, in the aggregate, than the
Confidentiality Agreement, it being understood that such confidentiality
agreement need not prohibit the submission of Acquisition Proposals or
amendments thereto to the Company in accordance with this _Section 5.8_); and
(B) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person regarding the
Acquisition Proposal; provided, that the Company shall (x) promptly notify
Parent (within twenty-four (24) hours) in writing (1) of any such
determination by the Companys Board of Directors that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal
and that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to lead to a
breach of the duties of the Companys directors to the Companys stockholders
under applicable Law (2) of any such furnishing of information, and (y)
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company, the
Operating Partnership or any other Company Subsidiary that is provided to any
Person pursuant to this _Section 5.8(c)_ and was not previously provided to
Parent promptly following any delivery of such information to such Person. Any

 



      
 

 



 

public disclosure or announcement by the Company relating to an Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change by the
Company, unless the Board of Directors of the Company affirms that it is not
modifying or changing in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger in such disclosure.

 



 

(d) The Company promptly shall (and in no event less than twenty-four (24)
hours following the Companys initial receipt of any Acquisition Proposal)
notify Parent of its receipt of any Acquisition Proposal and shall, in any
such notice to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal. In addition, the Company shall promptly (but in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours after the receipt thereof) provide to
Parent copies of any written documentation material to understanding such
Acquisition Proposal (" _Other Acquisition Documentation_ ") which is received
by the Company from the Person (or from any representatives or agents of such
Person) making such Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall not, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, take any action to exempt any Person
from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in any applicable
Laws or to otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or terminate,
waive, amend or modify any provision of any existing confidentiality to which
it or any Company Subsidiary is a party, and the Company shall use reasonable
best efforts to, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries, to use reasonable
best efforts to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement (provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required to take, or
be prohibited from taking, any action otherwise prohibited by this sentence if
and only, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith,
after considering the advice of outside legal counsel, that taking such or
action or failing to take such action, as the case may be, would be reasonably
likely to result in a breach of the duties of the Companys directors to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law). The Company shall provide to
Parent within twenty-four (24) hours after receipt thereof all copies of any
additional Other Acquisition Documentation received by the Company from the
Person (or from any representatives or agents of such Person) making such
Acquisition Proposal. The Board of Directors of the Company shall promptly
consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or
the Merger proposed by Parent in response to any Acquisition Proposal.
Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current
basis of the status of and material terms and conditions (including any
changes to the material terms and conditions) of any such Acquisition
Proposal.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if, at any
time before obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives
an unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach
of this _Section 5.8_ and that the Companys Board of Directors determines in
good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and
financial advisor) constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company may terminate
this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal if its Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the duties of the Companys
directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
that concurrently with such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee
payable pursuant to _Section 7.2(b)_ (but subject to the provisions of
_Section 7.2(e)_); and _provided,_ _further,_ that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.8(e)_

 



      
 

 



 

unless the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a " _Termination
Notice_ ") to Parent, at least three (3) Business Days in advance of taking
such action (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to terminate this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making the Superior
Proposal), and shall be accompanied by a copy of a draft of the definitive
agreement proposed to be entered into with respect to the Superior Proposal,
and (ii) during the Notice Period, the Company shall negotiate in good faith
with Parent (to the extent Parent desires to do so) to make such adjustments
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such that such Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and provided further,
however, that after the expiration of such three (3) Business Day period and
prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.8(e)_,
the Companys Board of Directors shall have confirmed (after taking into
account any such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement)
that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal. In the
event that during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior
Proposal and the Companys Board of Directors in its good faith judgment
determines such revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the
purchase price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision),
the Company shall be required to deliver a new Termination Notice and to
comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.8(e)_ with respect to such
new Termination Notice.

 



 

(f) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i)
taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14e 2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or (ii) making any other
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the case of any disclosure
described in this clause (ii), the Companys Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to make such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the duties of
the Companys directors to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

 



 

Section 5.9. _Expenses and Fees_. Subject to _Section 7.2_, whether or not
the Mergers are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by
the party incurring such expenses.

 



 

Section 5.10. _Directors  and Officers Exculpation, Indemnification and
Insurance_.

 



 

(a) Parent agrees that it shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company and the
applicable Company Subsidiaries (other than any Erdman Company) to, assume and
perform all rights to exculpation and indemnification in favor of, and all
rights to advancement of expenses to, each Person who at the Effective Time is
a current or former director or officer of the Company or any such Company
Subsidiary, as such rights exist pursuant to the MGCL (in the case of the
Company), the Companys Charter or Bylaws, the organizational documents and
governing Law of any such Company Subsidiary or any written agreement between
any such Person and the Company or any such Company Subsidiary in effect on
the date of this Agreement, for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions occurring in connection with this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), and
such rights shall continue in full force and effect until 180 days after the
expiration of the longest applicable statute of limitation. Parent also agrees
that, from and after the Effective Time, it shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Company to) honor,

 



      
 

 



 

and perform all obligations of, the Company and each Company Subsidiary in
respect of all such rights to exculpation and indemnification and advancement
of expenses, including by paying or otherwise making available (or causing to
be paid or made available) all requisite funds in a timely manner.

 



 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause the
Surviving Company to) maintain in effect for not less than six years from the
Effective Time the insurance coverage provided under the policies of
directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company at the
date of this Agreement, under the policies described in _Section 5.10_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedule attached hereto; provided, that Parent or the
Surviving Company may substitute therefor one or more policies issued by one
or more carriers with an equal or greater credit rating from A.M. Best Company
(or a comparable rating agency) as relevant carriers that are being replaced,
which substitute policies shall provide at least the same coverage as that
under the policies being replaced on terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous to such Persons, but only if such substitution does not result in
any lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; and provided, further, that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Company shall be required to pay an annual premium for such coverage in excess
of 225% of the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the date of
this Agreement; and if Parent or the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this _Section 5.10_, it shall obtain as much comparable
insurance as possible for an annual premium equal to such maximum amount.
Parents obligations under this paragraph may be satisfied by the purchase of
a "tail" insurance policy that provides the coverage described above.

 



 

Section 5.11. _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall honor, and cause the
Surviving Company to honor, each Company Benefit Plan listed on _Section
3.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ that is not an Erdman Benefit Plan
and any related funding arrangements of any such Company Benefit Plan in
accordance with its terms. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Parent shall honor, and cause the Surviving Company to honor, all rights to
vacation, personal and sick days accrued by employees of the Acquired
Companies under the Company Benefit Plans and reflected in the records of the
Company through and including the Effective Time. Until the date that is
twelve (12) months after the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, and cause
the Surviving Company to provide, pension, welfare and fringe benefits (other
than incentive compensation, equity-based compensation, defined benefit
pension benefits and retiree medical benefits) to the employees of the
Acquired Companies that are in the aggregate no less favorable than the
pension, welfare and fringe benefits (other than incentive compensation,
equity-based compensation, defined benefit pension benefits and retiree
medical benefits) that, at the election of Parent, are provided (x) to such
employees pursuant to Company Benefit Plans on the date of this Agreement or
(y) by Parent to its similarly situated employees. Nothing herein shall
require Parent to continue any particular Company Benefit Plan or prevent the
Parent from terminating (or causing the termination of) the employment of any
employee of the Acquired Companies at any time after the Closing Date for any
reason (or no reason).

 



 

(b) With respect to any employee benefit plans in which any employees of the
Acquired Companies first become eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time, and in

 



      
 

 



 

which the employees of the Acquired Companies did not generally participate
before the Effective Time, Parent shall, to the extent applicable: (i) waive
all pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the employees of the
Acquired Companies under any such new plans in which such employees may be
eligible to participate after the Effective Time, except to the extent such
pre-existing conditions, exclusions or waiting periods would apply under the
analogous Company Benefit Plan; (ii) provide each employee of the Acquired
Companies with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs (to the same extent such
credit was given under the analogous Company Benefit Plan before the Effective
Time) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible to participate
after the Effective Time; (iii) recognize all service of such employees for
all purposes (including purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
entitlement to benefits and benefit accrual (other than under any defined
benefit plan)) in any such new plan in which such employees may be eligible to
participate after the Effective Time; and (iv) with respect to flexible
spending accounts, provide each employee of the Acquired Companies with a
credit for any salary reduction contributions made thereto and a debit for any
expenses incurred thereunder with respect to the plan year in which the
Effective Time occurs; provided, that the foregoing shall not require
duplication of benefits.

 



 

(c) Prior to making any written or oral communications to the directors,
officers or employees of the Company, the Operating Partnership or any other
Company Subsidiary pertaining to compensation or benefit matters that are
affected by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall
provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication, and Parent shall
have a reasonable period of time to review and comment on the communication,
and Parent and the Company shall cooperate in providing any such mutually
agreeable communication; _provided_ , that the Erdman Companies shall not be
required to provide to Parent for review any communications from any of the
Erdman Companies to officers and employees of the Erdman Companies that relate
solely to the compensation and benefits obligations of the Erdman Companies.

 



 

(d) If requested by Parent prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
Operating Partnership or a Company Subsidiary, as applicable, shall adopt
resolutions, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, and take
(or cause to be taken) all other actions reasonably determined by Parent to be
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective immediately at least one day
prior to the Closing Date (the " _ERISA Effective Date_ "), any Company
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and
containing a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (a
" _401(k) Plan_"). Prior to the ERISA Effective Date, the Company shall
provide Parent with executed copies of all resolutions authorizing such
termination and amending any such 401(k) Plan commensurate with its
termination to the extent necessary to comply with all applicable Laws. The
Company, the Operating Partnership and the other Company Subsidiaries shall
also take such other actions in furtherance of the termination of each 401(k)
Plan as Parent may reasonably request, including such actions as Parent may
require prior to the Effective Time to support Parent obtaining a
determination letter with respect to the termination of each 401(k) Plan
following the ERISA Effective Date.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies shall adopt such
resolutions and take such other actions as are necessary and sufficient to
provide that, subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the current or
former trustees, directors, officers, or employees of the Erdman Companies (or
any dependent or beneficiary thereof) shall not be eligible to participate in
the Company Benefit Plans (other than any Erdman Benefit Plan) on or after the
Closing Date. Prior to the Effective Time, the Acquired Companies shall
provide Parent with copies of all such resolutions. The Acquired Companies
shall also take such other actions in furtherance of the foregoing as Parent
may reasonably request. The Company, the Operating Partnership and any Company
Subsidiary shall cooperate in mutual good faith with Parent to effectuate the
transition of employees and Company Benefit Plans as mutually agreed upon
between such parties.

 



 

(f) This _Section 5.11_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit
of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section 5.11_,
expressed or implied, is intended to confer upon any other Person any rights
or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section
5.11_. Without limiting the foregoing, no provision of this _Section 5.11_
shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any current or former
employee, director or consultant of the Company in respect of continued
employment or service (or resumed employment or service). Nothing contained in
this _Section 5.11_, express or implied, is intended to constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or shall
prohibit the Parent from amending, suspending, or terminating any such Company
Benefit Plan at any time in accordance with its terms.

 



 

Section 5.12. _Certain Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) None of Parent, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership, or their
respective Affiliates shall take any action from and after the Effective Time
that is inconsistent with the Companys or Parents qualification as a REIT
within the meaning of Section 856 of the Code before the Effective Time. After
the Effective Time, Parent, the Surviving Company, the Surviving Partnership
and their respective Affiliates will take all necessary and desirable actions
to preserve the Companys and Parents qualification as a REIT for all periods
before the Effective Time.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of and shall duly and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed
with any Governmental Entity, including any Tax Returns regarding any
conveyance or transfer taxes that may become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall pay all real
property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value-added stock transfer
and stamp taxes, all transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any
similar taxes that become payable in connection with the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement without any deduction or
withholding from the Per Share Consideration.

 



 

Section 5.13. _Section 16 Matters_. Before the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any dispositions of

resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

by each individual who is or would be subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to such transactions to have
the benefit of the exemptions available pursuant to 16b-3 under the Exchange
Act.

 



 

Section 5.14. _Erdman Purchase Agreement; Erdman Proceeds_.

Companies to, use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Erdman
Closing to occur prior to the Closing in accordance with the terms of the
Erdman Purchase Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall not, and shall cause the Erdman Seller and the Erdman
Companies not to, agree to or effect any amendment or modification to, or any
waiver under, or any termination of or assign any of their respective rights
under the Erdman Purchase Agreement or any agreement, document or instrument
contemplated thereby or executed in connection therewith without the prior
written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

 



 

(c) The Company shall cause any Company Subsidiary (including the Erdman
Seller and any Erdman Company) which receives any of the Erdman Proceeds to
directly or indirectly pay dividends to the Company and the Operating
Partnership in an amount equal to the Erdman Proceeds, if any, so received,
promptly (and in no event later than one (1) Business Day) after the receipt
thereof.

 



 

(d) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Company and the Operating
Partnership shall declare and pay cash dividends to the holders of the Company

amount equal to the Erdman Proceeds, if any (the " _Erdman Dividend_ ").

by written notice from Parent to the Company not less than two Business Days

the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent and its
Affiliates shall have the right to communicate and negotiate with, on behalf
of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (1) any lenders of the Company
and/or the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Indebtedness of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (2) any counterparties to joint venture
or partnership agreements and/or (3) any lessors under Ground Leases (a) to
obtain any consent of such parties, if required, in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) to amend, waive, modify,
restate or renegotiate the existing terms of any Indebtedness of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries or any such Ground Lease or joint venture or
partnership agreement, including with respect to any prepayment or similar
penalties or acceleration of Indebtedness that could result by virtue of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and/or with respect to any rights
of first offer or equity conversion rights that may benefit any such parties;
_provided_ , that the effectiveness of any amendment, modification,
restatement, agreement or arrangement

 



      
 

 



 

with such parties contemplated under clause (b) above shall be conditioned on
the consummation of the Mergers or the approval of the Company; _provided,
further,_ that (i) Parent and its Affiliates shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the communications and negotiations with any such parties, which
shall include providing the Company with drafts of any proposed arrangements
or agreements with such parties on a reasonably current basis, and (ii) to the
extent practicable, representatives of the Company shall be invited to attend
and observe any such negotiations, meetings or conference calls with such
parties ( _provided_ that attendance at any such negotiation, meeting or on
any such conference calls by any such representative of the Company shall not
be a pre-condition to the commencement or continuation of any such
negotiation, meeting or conference call). The Company shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent in connection with the foregoing as and to the extent
requested by Parent.

 



 

Section 5.17. _Estoppels_. Within twenty (20) days after the date of this

specified in such notice from Parent an estoppel certificate in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit A-2_. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries shall have any further obligation in respect of such estoppel
certificates, and receipt of such certificates shall not be a condition to any
partys obligations hereunder.

 



 

Section 5.18. _Specified Agreements_. At the request, and in accordance with
the reasonable instructions, of Parent at any time and from time to time prior
to the Closing, the Operating Partnership shall carry out and comply with the

 **ARTICLE VII**

 



 

 **TERMINATION**

may be abandoned at any time before the Effective Time, whether before or
after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval:

 



 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent; or

 



 

(b) by either the Company or Parent, if:

 



 

(i) the Closing has not occurred on or before June 29, 2012 (the "
_Termination Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available to any party
whose breach of any provision of this Agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, or materially contributed to, the failure to hold the Closing on
or before the Termination Date (for this purpose, breach by any Purchaser
Party shall be attributed to Parent); or

 



 

(ii) if any Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling
or taken any other action permanently enjoining, restraining or otherwise
prohibiting either of the Mergers or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and non-appealable; provided, that neither party may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 7.1(b)(ii)_ unless that
party first shall have used its reasonable best efforts to prevent the entry
of and/or to procure the removal, reversal, dissolution, setting aside or
invalidation of any such order, decree, ruling or other action; or

 



 

(iii) the Company Stockholders Meeting shall have been duly held and the votes
cast at the Company Stockholders Meeting (including any adjournment thereof)

provided, however, that the

 



      
 

 



 

right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_ shall not
be available to the Company where the failure to obtain the Company
Stockholder Approval is caused by any action or failure to act of the Company
that constitutes a material breach of this Agreement; or

 



 

(c) by the Company:

 



 

(i) in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.8(e)_, provided, however,

their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, other than the obligations
under the provisions of _Section 5.6(b)_, _Section 5.9_, this _Section 7.2_
and _Article VIII_, all of which shall survive any termination of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that nothing contained in this _Section 7.2(a)_ shall
relieve any party from liability arising out of any knowing or intentional
breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set

be the exclusive remedy available to the Purchaser Parties and their
Affiliates (other than in respect of any knowing or intentional breach of this
Agreement).

 



 

(b) The Company agrees that:

 



 

(i) if this Agreement is terminated (A) by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_, or (B) by Parent pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, the Company

to the authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution,
delivery and

 



      
 

 



 

performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in an
amount equal to $5,000,000 (the " _Company Expense Reimbursement_ ").

 



 

(ii) if this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, the Company shall, within two Business Days after such
termination, pay to Parent the Company Expense Reimbursement; _provided_ that
if, (x) prior to such termination an Acquisition Proposal by a third party has
been publicly disclosed or announced (or has otherwise become publicly known)
and (y) within one year after any such termination of this Agreement the
Company shall consummate, or enter into a definitive agreement providing for,
a transaction relating to any Acquisition Proposal (but replacing references
to "25% or more" in the definition of Acquisition Proposal with "more than
50%"), including a tender offer or exchange offer (each an " _Alternative
Transaction_ "), recommend an Alternative Transaction to its stockholders or

each case, need not have been the Alternative Transaction that shall have been
publicly disclosed or announced or publicly made known prior to termination
hereof, the Company shall pay to Parent (in addition to the Company Expense
Reimbursement) the Company Termination Fee immediately upon the date upon
which the Company enters into any agreement relating to the Alternative
Transaction, _provided_ , that any transaction solely in which equity
securities are issued by the Company for cash in a _bona_ _fide_ capital
raising transaction shall not constitute an Alternative Transaction. For the
avoidance of doubt, no Company Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant under
this _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_ until an agreement in respect of an Alternative
Transaction is entered into;

 



 

(iii) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_, where the breach of the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, either
individually or in the aggregate, would result in, if occurring or continuing
on the Closing Date, the failure of the conditions set forth in _Section
6.2(a)_ or _(b)_ to be satisfied, the Company shall, within two Business Days
after such termination, pay to Parent the Company Expense Reimbursement;
_provided, however_ , that (x) if prior to such termination an Acquisition
Proposal by a third party has been publicly disclosed or announced (or has
otherwise become publicly known) and (y) within one year after any such
termination of this Agreement the Company shall consummate an Alternative
Transaction, recommend an Alternative Transaction to its stockholders or enter
into any agreement relating to any Alternative Transaction, which, in each
case, need not have been the Alternative Transaction that shall have been
publicly disclosed or announced or publicly made known prior to termination
hereof, the Company shall pay the Company Termination Fee (in addition to the
Company Expense Reimbursement) to Parent immediately upon the date upon which
the Company enters into any agreement relating to the Alternative Transaction;
_provided_ , that any transaction solely in which equity securities are issued
by the Company for cash in a bona fide capital raising transaction shall not
constitute an Alternative Transaction; and

 



 

(iv) if this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(iii)_ or _Section 7.1(d)(iv)_, the Company shall, within two Business
Days after such termination, pay to Parent the Company Expense Reimbursement.

 



 

(c) Parent agrees that if this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Sections 7.1(c)(ii)_ or _7.1(c)(iii)_ (but in the case of a termination
pursuant to _Section_

 



      
 

 



 

 _7.1(c)(ii)_ , the breach of the representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, or the inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, shall have
contributed materially to the failure of the Closing to have occurred), then
Parent shall (x) pay Company as liquidated damages an amount equal to
$15,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination Fee_ ") within two Business Days after
such termination and (y) reimburse the Company for all of its reasonable out-
of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any of
its Affiliates in connection with or related to the authorization,
preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, in an amount equal
to $5,000,000.

 



 

(d) The Company Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee (each a "
_Termination Fee_ ") shall be paid as directed by the party entitled to
receive it (Parent or the Company, as applicable) by wire transfer of
immediately available funds. Under no circumstances shall a party be required
to pay a Termination Fee earlier than one full Business Day after such party
receives appropriate wire transfer instructions from the party entitled to
payment. Under no circumstances shall a party be required to pay more than one
Termination Fee.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, the amount of the
Termination Fee (each a " _Termination Payment_ ") payable to the Company (the
" _Recipient_ ") pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ in any taxable year of the
Recipient shall not exceed the sum (calculated for the Recipients taxable
year in which such amount is received) of (A) the amount that it is determined
should not be gross income to the Recipient for purposes of the requirements
of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, with such determination to be set
forth in an opinion of outside tax counsel to the Recipient plus (B) such
additional amount that it is estimated can be paid to the Recipient in such
taxable year without creating a risk that the payment would cause the
Recipient to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code, determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute
income described in Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (" _Qualifying
Income_ "), which determination shall be made by independent tax accountants
to the Recipient, plus (C) if the Recipient receives a letter from outside tax
counsel to the Recipient indicating that the Recipient has received a ruling
from the IRS holding that the Recipients receipt of the applicable
Termination Payment either would constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income of the Recipient for purposes of Sections 856(c)(2)
and (3) of the Code, the remaining balance of such Termination Payment. Any
amount of any Termination Payment that remains unpaid as of the end of a
taxable year shall be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable
year, subject to the foregoing limitation of this paragraph, provided that no
such payment need be made after the fifth anniversary of the date of
termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Recipient shall cease to
qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, the entire unpaid balance
of any Termination Payment shall be payable immediately.
