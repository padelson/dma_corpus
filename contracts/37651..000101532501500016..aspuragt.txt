conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, Buyer (or such wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Buyer as the Buyer may identify prior to the Closing Date)

attributable to periods from and after the Closing Date or are reflected
on the Closing Balance Sheet;  \t\t(d) all obligations and liabilities of
the Sellers under the Leases (as that term is defined in Section 5.9(b))

collectively called the "Assumed Indebtedness"); and  \t\t(g) all other
liabilities and obligations of the Sellers relating to the Business set forth
on the Schedules attached hereto (as such schedules may be amended, with
the consent of the Buyer, prior to the Closing Date) to the extent such
obligations and liabilities are attributable to periods from and after the
Closing Date or are reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet.  \t1.4

this Agreement or any of the schedules attached hereto, Buyer shall not

(i) arising from the offsite disposal of Hazardous Substances generated or

of Colbert County, Alabama;     \t\t\t\t\t\t4   \t\t(i) all
liabilities of Parent or the Sellers arising from or related to any "employee
benefit plan" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA;  \t\t(j)
all liabilities of the Sellers for all claims, costs and assessments under
worker\'s compensation laws that are made or incurred by any of the Employees
(as that term is defined in Section 5.17(a)) after the Closing Date but
made with respect to injuries incurred by the Employees prior to the Closing
Date; and  \t\t(k) all liabilities of the Sellers for all "welfare benefit
claims," costs and assessments under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA) which provides medical, health, disability, accident,

post- employment benefits or retiree medical, health, disability, accident,
life insurance or other such benefits and claims under a "cafeteria plan" as
defined in Section 125(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
that are made or incurred by any of the Employees prior to the Closing Date
but that are payable to any of the Employees on or after the Closing
Date. For purposes of this Section 1.4, "Income Tax" shall mean any federal,
state, county, local or foreign income, franchise, alternative minimum, add-
on minimum or other Tax measured by net income, together with all interest,
penalties or additions to Tax or other assessments imposed with respect
thereto (including any transferee or secondary liability for any Income Tax
and any liability with respect thereto arising as a result of being
(or ceasing to be) a member of any affiliated, consolidated, combined or
unitary group (or being included, or required to be included, in any Tax
Return relating thereto), as well as any liability under any tax sharing
agreement with respect thereto)  \t1.5 \tNonassignable Contracts; Minority
Stock Interests.  \t\t(a) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to the
contrary, no contracts, properties, rights or other assets of Sellers shall
be deemed to be sold, transferred or assigned to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement if the attempted sale, transfer or assignment thereof to Buyer
without the consent or approval of another party or governmental entity would
be ineffective or would constitute a breach of contract or a violation of
any law or regulation or would in any other way materially and adversely
affect the rights of Sellers (or Buyer as transferee or assignee) and such
consent or approval is not obtained on or prior to the Closing Date (the
"Unobtained Consents"). In such case, to the extent reasonably possible: (A)
the beneficial interest in or to such contracts, properties or other assets
(collectively, the "Beneficial Rights") shall in any event pass as of the
Closing Date to Buyer under this Agreement, and (B) pending such consent or
approval, Buyer shall assume or discharge the liabilities of Sellers under
such Beneficial Rights as agent for Sellers, and Sellers shall act
as Buyer\'s agent in receipt of any benefits, rights or interests received
from the Beneficial Rights. Buyer and Sellers shall use reasonable best
efforts (and bear their respective costs) without payment of any material
fees, penalties or other amounts to any third party to obtain or secure any
and all consents or approvals that may be necessary to effect the legal and
valid sale, transfer or assignment of contracts, properties, rights or other
assets underlying the Beneficial Rights. Buyer and Sellers shall make or
complete such transfers as soon as reasonably practicable and cooperate with
each other in any other reasonable arrangement to which the Buyer has
consented and which is designed to provide for Buyer the Beneficial Rights
including    \t\t\t\t\t\t5   enforcement at the cost and for the
account of Buyer of any and all rights of Sellers against the other
party thereto, and to provide for the discharge by Buyer of any liability
under such contracts, properties or other assets.  \t\t(b) In the event that
it appears likely that on or after the Closing Date there will be any
material Unobtained Consent, at the election of Buyer and upon notification
by the Buyer to the Sellers, the Sellers and Parent will cause
the shareholders of the Sellers (the "Contract Sellers") that are the owners
or holders of the interests in or to the contracts, properties or other
assets to which the Unobtained Consent relates to transfer the stock of such
Contract Sellers to the Buyer for no additional consideration.  \t\t(c) At
the request of the Buyer, the portion of the stock of DeKalb Stone, Inc.
owned by any of the Sellers shall be transferred to the Buyer in lieu of the
Acquired Assets that are owned by DeKalb Stone, Inc.  \t1.6 \tPurchase
Price for Acquired Assets.  \t\t(a) Purchase Price. The aggregate
purchase price to be paid to Sellers for the Acquired Assets will be equal
to $150,000,000.00, less (a) $15,000,000.00 to be deposited in escrow
pursuant to the terms of Section 1.6(b) below (the "Escrow Deposit"), and (b)
the amount of the Assumed Indebtedness based on the payoff values set forth
on Schedule 1.3(f) (the "Purchase Price"). The Purchase Price shall
be adjusted pursuant to subsection (c) below.  \t\t(b) Escrow Arrangement.
At the Closing, the Escrow Deposit shall be deposited with an escrow agent
that is mutually agreeable to the Buyer and the Sellers (the
"Escrow Agent"), under an Escrow Agreement in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement"). The Buyer and
the Sellers agree that the Escrow Deposit shall be disbursed in accordance
with the Escrow Agreement and in accordance with the provisions set forth in
Schedule 1.6(b) attached hereto.  \t\t(c) Determination of Certain Purchase
Price Adjustments.  \t\t\t(i) Within five (5) business days prior to
the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall jointly and in good faith prepare
an estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in subsection (ii)
below) (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet") based on the Sellers\' books
and records and other information then available, to determine Estimated
Closing Working Capital and Buyer shall be given access to such books and
records and other information and the opportunity to consult with the Sellers
for purposes of preparing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet. For purposes
hereof, (A) "Estimated Closing Working Capital" means the GAAP book value of
the Sellers\' total cash, accounts receivable, notes receivable and inventory
less the Sellers\' total accounts payable and accrued expenses (other than
the current portion of any intercompany accounts) (any of which amounts may
be a negative number), in each case to the extent that any of such
liabilities constitute Assumed Liabilities, determined from the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date; provided,
however, that if Buyer and the Sellers are unable to agree on any of
the Estimated Closing Working Capital, such disputed amounts
shall be determined based on the amounts set forth on the
Sellers\' balance sheet as of the month-ending
immediately    \t\t\t\t\t\t6   prior to the Closing Date. At the
Closing, the Purchase Price will be either (A) reduced by the amount
$8,275,000.00 exceeds the Estimated Closing Working Capital or (B) increased
by the amount Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds
$8,275,000.00.  \t\t\t(ii) As promptly as practicable but in no event later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer in good faith shall
prepare and will cause its auditors to audit a balance sheet of the Sellers
as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet")
for the purpose of establishing the Actual Closing Working Capital. The
Closing Balance Sheet shall be delivered by Buyer to Sellers no later than
sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. For purposes hereof, "Actual Closing
Working Capital" means the GAAP book value of the Sellers\' total cash,
accounts receivable, notes receivable and inventory less the Sellers\' total
accounts payable and accrued expenses (other than the current portion of any
intercompany accounts) (any of which amounts may be a negative number), in
each case to the extent that any of such liabilities constitute Assumed
Liabilities, determined from the Closing Balance Sheet. The Closing Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the
same principles and methodologies used by Sellers immediately prior to the
Closing Date to the extent such principles and methodologies are in
accordance with GAAP.  \t\t\t(iii) If Actual Closing Working
Capital exceeds Estimated Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall,
within thirty (30) days pay to Sellers the amount of such excess. If Actual
Closing Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing Working Capital,
Sellers shall within thirty (30) days pay to Buyer in immediately available
funds the amount of such shortfall. All amounts owed pursuant to this
subsection (iii) shall include interest, from the Closing Date to the date
of payment, at the Prime Rate (as defined in Section 8.6(g)
below) calculated on the basis of a 365-day year.  \t\t\t(iv) If Sellers
disagree with any item on the Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers shall notify
Buyer in writing of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after
Sellers\' receipt thereof (such notice setting forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement). Buyer shall permit Sellers access
to such work papers relating to the preparation of the Closing Balance Sheet
as may be reasonably necessary to permit Sellers to review in detail the
manner in which the Closing Balance Sheet was prepared. Buyer and Sellers
shall thereafter negotiate in good faith to resolve any such
disagreements; provided, however, that Sellers or Buyer, as the case may
be, shall within thirty (30) days pay to Buyer or Sellers, as the case may
be, the amount determined pursuant to subsection (iii) above which is not
subject to dispute, if any. If Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve any
such disagreements within thirty (30) days, Buyer and Sellers shall jointly
retain KPMG Peat Marwick (the "Auditor").  \t\t\t(v) Buyer and Sellers
shall direct the Auditor to render a determination within thirty (30) days of
its retention and Buyer and Sellers shall use their best efforts to cause
the Auditor to resolve all disagreements over individual line items as soon
as possible. The Auditor shall consider only those items and amounts in the
Closing Balance Sheet which Buyer and Sellers are unable to resolve. The
determination of the Auditor shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and
Sellers. The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be borne one-half

Losses shall not exceed 10% of the Purchase Price; provided, that, the
foregoing shall not apply in respect of any Loss with respect to the breach
by Parent or Sellers of any representation or warranty made by Sellers
in Section 5.2.  \t\t(c) Parent and Sellers will be liable to the Buyer
Group with respect to claims referred to in Section 8.2(a) above only if
Buyer gives Parent or Sellers written notice thereof within 1 year after the
Closing Date, except for claims arising from breaches of the representations
and warranties set forth in Section 5.2 as to which claims may be made at any
time.  \t\t(d) Buyer agrees to indemnify Parent and Sellers and hold Parent
and Sellers harmless from and against any Loss which Parent or Sellers may
suffer, sustain or become subject to, (i) as the result of a breach of any
(A) representation or warranty, or (B) covenant or agreement by Buyer
contained in this Agreement, (ii) for Assumed Liabilities (whether or
not accrued, whether arising before, on or after the Closing
Date, regardless of when asserted), or (iii)    \t\t\t\t\t\t 29   as a
result of Buyer\'s conduct of the Business or use of the Acquired Assets and
or the sale of any product on or after the Closing Date; provided that Buyer
will be liable to Parent or Sellers with respect to claims referred to in
clause (i)(A) in the preceding sentence only if (x) Sellers give Buyer
written notice thereof within 1 year after the Closing Date and (y) only to
the extent that the aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds $1,600,000
and does not exceed 10% of the Purchase Price.  \t\t(e) If a party hereto
seeks indemnification under this Section 8.2, such party (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give written notice to the other party (the
"Indemnifying Party") of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the
claim. In that regard, if any suit, action, claim, liability or obligation
shall be brought or asserted by any third party which, if adversely
determined, would entitle the Indemnified Party to indemnity pursuant to this
Section 8.2, the Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying
Party of the same in writing, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of
such claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying Party, if
it so elects (except that the Indemnifying Party may not so elect without the
Indemnified Party\'s consent unless (i) the Indemnifying Party provides
reasonable evidence to the Indemnified Party of its financial ability to
satisfy its indemnification obligations, (ii) the suit, action,
claim, liability or obligation does not seek to impose any liability
or obligation upon the Indemnified Party other than for money damages, and
(iii) such suit, action, claim, liability or obligation does not relate to
the Indemnified Party\'s relationship with its customers or employees), shall
assume and control the defense thereof (and shall consult with
the Indemnified Party with respect thereto), including the employment of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of
expenses. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume and control the defense,
the Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ counsel separate from
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the expense of the
Indemnified Party unless (y) the employment thereof has been specifically
authorized by the Indemnifying Party in writing or (z) the Indemnifying Party
has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel. The Indemnifying
Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or proceeding,
the defense of which it has elected to assume, which settlement is effected
without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party. If there shall be a
settlement to which the Indemnifying Party consents or a final judgment for
the plaintiff in any action or proceeding, the Indemnifying Party shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and against any loss
or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment.  \t\t(f) The amount
of any Loss subject to indemnification hereunder or of any claim therefor
shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit inuring to Buyer, the Sellers
or any of their Affiliates on account of such Loss and (ii) any insurance
proceeds (net of direct collection expenses) received or receivable by Buyer,
the Sellers and, its Subsidiaries on account of such Loss. If Buyer, the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates receives a Tax Benefit after
an indemnification payment is made, Buyer shall promptly pay to the Sellers
the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent
that such Tax Benefit is realized. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall
mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which
otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the highest
marginal tax rates. Buyer and the Sellers shall seek full recovery under all
insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as    \t\t\t\t\t\t
30   they would if such Loss were not subject to
indemnification hereunder. In the event that an insurance recovery is made
by Buyer, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates with respect to any Loss
for which any such Person has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal
to the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection
expenses) shall be made promptly to the Sellers.  \t\t(g) All
indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated by all parties as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.  \t\t(h) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 8.2, there shall be no recovery for any
Loss by Buyer under this Section 8.2, and the Loss shall not be included in
meeting the stated thresholds hereunder, to the extent such item has been
included in the calculation of Actual Closing Working Capital as determined
pursuant to Section 1.2 hereof.  \t8.3 Exclusive Remedy.  \t\t(a)
Following the Closing, except with respect to claims based upon intentional
misrepresentation, the indemnification provided by Section 8.2 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy to the exclusion of all other remedies
and recourse at law or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated herein, including without limitation, for
any Losses of the Buyer Group or the Sellers Group with respect to any
alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representations
or warranties or any breach or failure in performance of any covenants
or agreements made by Buyer or Sellers in this Agreement or in any Exhibit,
Schedule or Updated Schedule attached hereto or any certificate delivered
hereunder. Except as provided in Section 8.2, no claim shall be brought or
maintained by Buyer or Sellers or their respective successors or permitted
assigns against any officer, director or employee (present or former) of
Sellers, and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them, by
virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or
breach of any of the representations, warranties or covenants of Sellers set
forth or contained in this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder,
except to the extent that the same shall have been the result of fraud
by any such person (and in the event of such fraud, such recourse shall be
brought or granted solely against the person or persons committing such
fraud), and provided that without limiting the foregoing, in no event shall
Buyer, its successors or permitted assigns be entitled to claim or seek
consequential damages or any rescission of the transactions consummated under
this Agreement or other remedy at law or in equity. In no event shall any
officer, director or employee of any of the Sellers have any shared or
vicarious liability for the actions or omissions of any other
person.  \t\t(b) Buyer, the Sellers and their respective successors and
permitted assigns, hereby waive any right to seek contribution or other
recovery from any officer, director or employee (present or former) of any of
the Sellers, that any of them may now or in the future have under any
Environmental Requirements, including, without limitation, the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act,
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean
Air Act, any analogous state law, and any common law providing for any remedy
or right of recovery with respect to environmental matters. Buyer, the
Sellers and their respective successors and permitted assigns, hereby release
all officers, directors or employees (present or former) of any of the
Sellers from any and all such claims,    \t\t\t\t\t\t 31   demands,
and causes of action, that any of them may now or in the future have under
such Environmental Requirements.  \t8.4 Disclosure Generally. If and to the
extent any information required to be furnished in any schedule is contained
in this Agreement or in any Schedule (or Updated Schedule) attached hereto,
such information shall be deemed to be included in all Schedules (or Updated
Schedules) in which the information is required to be included (but only to
the extent such information can reasonably be determined to relate to
the other Schedules). The inclusion of any information in any Schedule (or
Updated Schedule) attached hereto shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment by the Sellers that such information is material to or outside
the ordinary course of the business of the Sellers.  \t8.5 Acknowledgment
by Buyer. THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY SELLERS EXPRESSLY AND
SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SCHEDULES (AND
UPDATED SCHEDULES) ATTACHED HERETO, CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS TO BUYER
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND
BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION,
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE SELLERS, EXCEPT FOR
THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN) ARE
SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLERS.  \t8.6 Arbitration
Procedures.  \t\t(a) The parties hereto agree that the arbitration
procedure set forth below shall be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving and remedying claims for money damages arising out of this
Agreement (the "Disputes"), except as otherwise provided by Section 1.2
above. Nothing in this Section 8.6 shall prohibit a party hereto from
instituting litigation to enforce any Final Determination (as defined
in subsection (e) below) or availing itself of the other remedies set forth
in Sections 9.5(c) and 9.9(d) below. The parties hereto hereby agree and
acknowledge that, except as otherwise provided in this Section 8.6 or in the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as in
effect from time to time, the arbitration procedures and any
Final Determination hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be enforced
pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act of the State of Florida.  \t\t(b)
In the event that any party hereto asserts that there exists a Dispute, such
party shall deliver a written notice to each other party involved therein
specifying the nature of the asserted Dispute and requesting a meeting
to attempt to resolve the same. If no such resolution is reached within ten
(10) business days after such delivery of such notice, the party delivering
such notice of Dispute (the "Disputing Person") may, within forty-five (45)
business days after delivery of such notice, commence arbitration hereunder
by delivering to each other party involved therein a notice of arbitration
(a "Notice of Arbitration"). Such Notice
of    \t\t\t\t\t\t32   Arbitration shall specify the matters as to
which arbitration is sought, the nature of any Dispute, the claims of each
party to the arbitration and shall specify the amount and nature of
any damages, if any, sought to be recovered as a result of any alleged
claim, and any other matters required by the Commercial Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association, as in effect from time to time, to be
included therein, if any.  \t\t(c) Buyer and Sellers shall each select
one independent arbitrator expert in the subject matter of the Dispute (the
arbitrators so selected shall be referred to herein as "Buyer\'s Arbitrator"
and "Sellers\' Arbitrator," respectively). In the event that either party
fails to select an independent arbitrator as set forth herein within twenty
(20) days from delivery of a Notice of Arbitration, then the matter shall be
resolved by the arbitrator selected by the other party. Sellers\' Arbitrator
and Buyer\'s Arbitrator shall select a third independent arbitrator expert in
the subject matter of the dispute, and the three arbitrators so selected
shall resolve the matter according to the procedures set forth in this
Section 8.6. If Sellers\' Arbitrator and Buyer\'s Arbitrator are unable to
agree on a third arbitrator within twenty (20) days after their selection,
Sellers\' Arbitrator and Buyer\'s Arbitrator shall each prepare a list of
three independent arbitrators. Sellers\' Arbitrator and Buyer\'s Arbitrator
shall each have the opportunity to designate as objectionable and eliminate
one arbitrator from the other arbitrator\'s list within seven days after
submission thereof, and the third arbitrator shall then be selected by lot
from the arbitrators remaining on the lists submitted by Sellers\' Arbitrator
and Buyer\'s Arbitrator.  \t\t(d) The arbitrator(s) selected pursuant
to subsection (c) above will determine the allocation of the costs and
expenses of arbitration based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the amount actually
contested by such party. For example, if Buyer submits a claim for $1,000,
and if Sellers contest only $500 of the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the
arbitrator(s) ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of
the $500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will be
allocated 60% (i.e. 300 ? 500) to Sellers and 40% (i.e. 200 ? 500) to
Buyer.  \t\t(e) The arbitration shall be conducted under the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association as in effect from
time to time, except as modified by the agreement of all parties. The
arbitrator(s) shall so conduct the arbitration that a final result,
determination, finding, judgment and/or award (the "Final Determination")
is made or rendered as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the
later of ninety (90) business days after the delivery of the Notice of
Arbitration and ten (10) days following completion of the arbitration. The
Final Determination must be agreed upon and signed by the sole arbitrator or
by at least two of the three arbitrators (as the case may be). The
Final Determination shall be final and binding on all parties and there
shall be no appeal from or reexamination of the Final Determination, except
for fraud, perjury, evident partiality or misconduct by an arbitrator
prejudicing the rights of any party and except to correct manifest clerical
errors.  \t\t(f) Buyer and Sellers may enforce any Final Determination in
any state or federal court having jurisdiction over the Dispute. For the
purpose of any action or proceeding instituted with respect to any Final
Determination, each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the
jurisdiction of such courts, irrevocably consents to the service of process
by registered mail or personal service and hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any   \t\t\t\t\t\t33   objection which
it may have or hereafter have as to personal jurisdiction, the laying of the
venue of any such action or proceeding brought in any such court and any
claim that any such action or proceeding brought in such court has been
brought in any inconvenient forum.  \t\t(g) If any party shall fail to pay
the amount of any damages, if any, assessed against it within ten (10) days
of the delivery to such party of such Final Determination, the unpaid amount
shall bear interest from the date of such delivery at the lesser of(i) the
prime rate, as declared by Citibank, N.A. from time to time (which rate shall
be adjusted on the effective date of each change in such rate) (the "Prime
Rate") plus 300 basis points and (ii) the maximum rate permitted
by applicable usury laws. Interest on any such unpaid amount shall be
compounded semiannually, computed on the basis of a 365-day year and shall be
payable on demand. In addition, such party shall promptly reimburse the other
party for all reasonable costs or expenses of any nature or kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to reasonable attorneys\' fees) incurred
in seeking to collect such damages or to enforce any
Final Determination.  \t\t\t\t\tARTICLE IX  \t\t\t\tADDITIONAL
AGREEMENTS  \t9.1 Tax Matters. The following provisions shall govern the
allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and Sellers for certain tax
matters following the Closing Date:  \t\t(a) Allocation of Purchase Price.
The Parties agree that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the
Sellers (plus other relevant items) will be allocated to the assets of the
Sellers for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting purposes) in
a manner consistent with the fair market values of such assets as determined
by mutual agreement of the parties hereto and set forth in Schedule 9.1(a)
attached hereto. Buyer and Sellers will file all Tax Returns (including
amended returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a manner
consistent with such values.  \t\t(b) Cooperation on Tax
Matters.  \t\t\t(i) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate fully, as and to the
extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing
of Tax Returns of, or which include, the Sellers and any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the other party\'s request) the provision of records and
information which are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or
other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Sellers agree (A) to retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters and pertinent to the Sellers relating to
any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of
the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any
extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all
record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (B)
to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring ,
destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the other party
so requests, the Sellers shall allow the other party to take possession of
such books and records.    \t\t\t\t\t\t 34   \t\t\t\t(ii) Buyer and
Sellers further agree, upon request, to use their best efforts to obtain any
certificate or other document from any governmental authority or any
other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax
that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby).  \t\t(c) Certain Taxes. All transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and
fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this
Agreement, shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer will, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect
to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
Taxes and fees, and, if required by applicable law, Sellers will, and
will cause their affiliates to, join in the execution of any such
Tax Returns and other documentation.  \t9.2 Employee and Employee Benefit
Matters. Effective as of the Closing Date, the employees of the Sellers
(the "Continued Employees") shall cease to be covered under the employee
benefit plans of Sellers and shall participate under the employee benefit
plans, programs and policies established by the Buyer. To the extent
permitted under the Buyer\'s\' employee benefit plans, the Continued
Employees shall be covered under the employee benefit plans without any
exclusion for pre- existing conditions and shall recognize the employees\'
service with Sellers for purposes of vesting and eligibility under
such plans.  \t9.3 Press Releases and Announcements. Prior to the Closing
Date, no press releases related to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, or other announcements to the employees, customers or
suppliers of the Sellers will be issued without the mutual approval of all
parties hereto, except for any public disclosure which any party in good
faith believes is required by law or regulation (in which case the
disclosure shall be prepared jointly by the Sellers and Buyer). After
the Closing Date, no press releases related to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein, or other announcements to the employees,
customers or suppliers of the Sellers will be issued without Buyer\'s consent
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld).  \t9.4 Further Transfers.
Sellers will execute and deliver such further instruments of conveyance and
transfer and take such additional action as Buyer may reasonably request
to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the transfer to Buyer of the
Acquired Assets and any other transactions contemplated hereby.  \t9.5
Investigation and Confidentiality.  \t\t(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer
may make or cause to be made such investigation of the business
and properties of the Sellers as it deems necessary or advisable
to familiarize itself therewith; provided that such investigation shall be
(i) reasonably related to the transactions contemplated thereby and (ii)
conducted in a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the normal
business operations of the Sellers. Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will
cause their officers, directors and employees to permit Buyer, its employees
and authorized representatives and representatives of the
financial institutions which are considering participation in the financing
of this transaction to (i) have full access to the premises, books and
records of the Sellers at reasonable hours, (ii) visit and inspect any of the
properties of the Sellers, and    \t\t\t\t\t\t 35   (iii) discuss the
affairs, finances and accounts of the Sellers with the directors, officers,
key employees of the Sellers.  \t\t(b) If the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are not consummated, Buyer will not disclose or use at any
time any information and materials reasonably designated by Sellers as
confidential (except that confidential information shall not include (i)
information which is publicly available through no fault of Buyer, or (ii)
information already known to Buyer or obtained by Buyer from a third party
not bound by any duty of confidentiality to Sellers), and Buyer and
its representatives will return to Sellers originals of and destroy copies
of all memoranda, notes, plans, records, documentation and other materials
obtained from Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement which Buyer may then possess or have under its control.
Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Sellers
will maintain the confidentiality of all information and materials regarding
Buyer and its affiliates reasonably designated by Buyer as confidential. If
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated, Sellers will
maintain the confidentiality of, and will not use for any purpose,
all proprietary and other non-public information regarding the Sellers
(including, without limitation, any of same included in the Intellectual
Property), except as necessary to file tax returns and other reports to
governmental agencies, and to turn over to Buyer at the Closing copies of all
such materials it has in its possession. In the event that Sellers are
requested or required (by oral question or request for information
or documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any such information,
Sellers will notify Buyer promptly of the request or requirement so that
Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with the
provisions of this Section 9.5. If, in the absence of a protective order or
the receipt of a waiver hereunder, Sellers are, on the advice of counsel,
compelled to disclose any information to any tribunal or else stand liable
for contempt, Sellers may disclose the information to the tribunal; provided,
however, that Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, at the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of
the information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate. This
Section 9.5 shall survive any expiration or termination of this
Agreement.  \t\t(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that in the
event of a breach by any party of any of the provisions of this Section 9.5,
monetary damages will not constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in
the event of any such breach, any non-breaching party and/or their
respective successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights
and remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of law or equity of
competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or injunctive or other
relief in order to enforce or prevent any violations of the provisions
hereof, in each case without the requirement of posting a bond or proving
actual damages.  \t9.6 Expenses. Sellers will pay the cost of the
title commitments required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section
2.1(i), and Buyer shall pay the premiums for any title insurance policies
that Buyer elects to obtain. Sellers and Buyer will each pay one-half of the
costs of any surveys obtained by Sellers in order to obtain the title
commitments required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section
2.1(i). Except as set forth in the preceding sentences of this Section 9.6
and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer and Sellers will pay all
of their   \t\t\t\t\t\t 36   own fees, costs and expenses (including,
without limitation, fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment
bankers, brokers or other representatives and consultants and
appraisal fees, costs and expenses) incurred in connection with
the negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of its obligations
hereunder, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby.  \t9.7 Exclusivity. Except as provided in this Section 9.7 and
subject to the fiduciary duties of the boards of directors of Sellers, until
this Agreement is terminated by its terms, Sellers will not (and Sellers will
not cause or permit any affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent of
the Sellers or their affiliates to), (a) solicit, initiate or encourage the
submission of any proposal or offer from any person or entity (including any
of them) relating to any (i) liquidation, dissolution or recapitalization of,
(ii) merger or consolidation, (iii) acquisition or purchase of assets of or
any equity interest in or (iv) similar transaction or business combination
involving, the Sellers or (b) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, furnish any information with respect to, assist or participate in,
or facilitate in any other manner any effort or attempt by any other Person
to do or seek any of the foregoing. Until this Agreement is terminated
by its terms, Sellers shall notify Buyer immediately if any Person makes any
proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to any of the
foregoing.  \t9.8 Books and Records. Unless otherwise consented to in
writing by Sellers or Buyer (as the case may be), Buyer and Sellers will not,
for a period of seven (7) years following the date hereof, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the books and records of the Sellers acquired by
Buyer hereunder or retained by Sellers without first offering to surrender
to Sellers or Buyer such books and records or any portion thereof of which
Sellers or Buyer may intend to destroy, alter or dispose of. Buyer and
Sellers will allow the other party\'s representatives, attorneys and
accountants access to such books and records, upon reasonable request and
during such party\'s normal business hours, for the purpose of examining and
copying the same in connection with any matter whether or not relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.  \t9.9 Accounts Receivable. In the event that any of the accounts
receivable on the Closing Balance Sheet remain uncollected for more than 120
days following the Closing Date, Buyer at its option may re-assign those
accounts receivable to Sellers, and Sellers shall pay to Buyer the face
amount of such accounts receivable less the amount of any reserves as set
forth on the Closing Balance Sheet.  \t\t\t\t\t ARTICLE
X  \t\t\t\t\tMISCELLANEOUS  \t10.1 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement
may be amended and any provision of this Agreement may be waived, provided
that any such amendment or waiver will be binding upon a party only if such
amendment or waiver is set forth in a writing executed by Buyer and Sellers.

this Agreement will be deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any
part of this Agreement or any rights or obligations of any party under or by
reason of this Agreement.    \t\t\t\t\t\t 37   \t10.2 Notices. All

Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
