						4
<PAGE>

		(i) all liabilities of Parent or the Sellers
arising from or related to any "employee benefit plan" as that
term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA;

		(j) all liabilities of the Sellers for all
claims, costs and assessments under worker's compensation laws
that are made or incurred by any of the Employees (as that term
is defined in Section 5.17(a)) after the Closing Date but made
with respect to injuries incurred by the Employees prior to the
Closing Date; and

		(k) all liabilities of the Sellers for all
"welfare benefit claims," costs and assessments under any

ceasing to be) a member of any affiliated, consolidated,
combined or unitary group (or being included, or required to be

	1.5 	Nonassignable Contracts; Minority Stock Interests.

		(a) Notwithstanding anything set forth herein to
the contrary, no contracts, properties, rights or other assets
of Sellers shall be deemed to be sold, transferred or assigned
to Buyer pursuant to this Agreement if the attempted sale,
transfer or assignment thereof to Buyer without the consent or
approval of another party or governmental entity would be
ineffective or would constitute a breach of contract or a
violation of any law or regulation or would in any other way
materially and adversely affect the rights of Sellers (or Buyer
as transferee or assignee) and such consent or approval is not
obtained on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Unobtained
Consents").  In such case, to the extent reasonably possible:
(A) the beneficial interest in or to such contracts, properties
or other assets (collectively, the "Beneficial Rights") shall in
any event pass as of the Closing Date to Buyer under this
Agreement, and (B) pending such consent or approval, Buyer shall
assume or discharge the liabilities of Sellers under such
Beneficial Rights as agent for Sellers, and Sellers shall act as
Buyer's agent in receipt of any benefits, rights or interests
received from the Beneficial Rights.  Buyer and Sellers shall
use reasonable best efforts (and bear their respective costs)
without payment of any material fees, penalties or other amounts
to any third party to obtain or secure any and all consents or
approvals that may be necessary to effect the legal and valid
sale, transfer or assignment of contracts, properties, rights or
other assets underlying the Beneficial Rights.  Buyer and
Sellers
shall make or complete such transfers as soon as reasonably
practicable and cooperate with each other in any other
reasonable
arrangement to which the Buyer has consented and which is
designed
to provide for Buyer the Beneficial Rights including



						5
<PAGE>

enforcement at the cost and for the account of Buyer
of any and all rights of Sellers against the other party
thereto, and to provide for the discharge by Buyer of any
liability under such contracts, properties or other assets.

		(b) In the event that it appears likely that on
or after the Closing Date there will be any material Unobtained
Consent, at the election of Buyer and upon notification by the
Buyer to the Sellers, the Sellers and Parent will cause the
shareholders of the Sellers (the "Contract Sellers") that are
the owners or holders of the interests in or to the contracts,
properties or other assets to which the Unobtained Consent
relates to transfer the stock of such Contract Sellers to the
Buyer for no additional consideration.

		(c) At the request of the Buyer, the portion of
the stock of DeKalb Stone, Inc. owned by any of the Sellers
shall be transferred to the Buyer in lieu of the Acquired Assets
that are owned by DeKalb Stone, Inc.

	1.6 	Purchase Price for Acquired Assets.

		(a) Purchase Price.  The aggregate purchase
price to be paid to Sellers for the Acquired Assets will be
equal to $150,000,000.00, less (a) $15,000,000.00 to be
deposited in escrow pursuant to the terms of Section 1.6(b)
below (the "Escrow Deposit"), and (b) the amount of the Assumed
Indebtedness based on the payoff values set forth on Schedule
1.3(f) (the "Purchase Price").  The Purchase Price shall be
adjusted pursuant to subsection (c) below.

		(b) Escrow Arrangement.  At the Closing, the
Escrow Deposit shall be deposited with an escrow agent that is
mutually agreeable to the Buyer and the Sellers (the "Escrow
Agent"), under an Escrow Agreement in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Escrow Agreement").  The
Buyer and the Sellers agree that the Escrow Deposit shall be
disbursed in accordance with the Escrow Agreement and in
accordance with the provisions set forth in Schedule 1.6(b)
attached hereto.

		(c) Determination of Certain Purchase Price
Adjustments.

			(i) Within five (5) business days prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall jointly and in good faith
prepare an estimate of the Closing Balance Sheet (as defined in
subsection (ii) below) (the "Estimated Closing Balance Sheet")
based on the Sellers' books and records and other information
then
available, to determine Estimated Closing Working Capital and
Buyer shall be given access to such books and records and other
information and the opportunity to consult with the Sellers for
purposes of preparing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet.  For
purposes hereof, (A) "Estimated Closing Working Capital" means
the
GAAP book value of the Sellers' total cash, accounts receivable,
notes receivable and inventory less the Sellers' total  accounts
payable and  accrued expenses (other than the current portion of
any intercompany accounts) (any of which amounts may be a
negative
number), in each case to the extent that any of such liabilities
constitute Assumed Liabilities, determined from the Estimated
Closing Balance Sheet as of the Closing Date; provided, however,
that if Buyer and the Sellers are unable to agree on any of the
Estimated Closing Working Capital, such disputed amounts shall
be
determined based on the amounts set forth on the Sellers'
balance
sheet as of the month-ending immediately



						6
<PAGE>

prior to the Closing Date.  At the Closing, the Purchase Price
will be either (A) reduced by the amount $8,275,000.00 exceeds
the
Estimated Closing Working Capital or (B) increased by the amount
Estimated Closing Working Capital exceeds $8,275,000.00.

			(ii) As promptly as practicable but in no
event later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
in good faith shall prepare and will cause its auditors to audit
a balance sheet of the Sellers as of the close of business on
the Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet") for the purpose
of establishing the Actual Closing Working Capital.  The Closing
Balance Sheet shall be delivered by Buyer to Sellers no later
than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date.  For purposes
hereof, "Actual Closing Working Capital" means the GAAP book
value of the Sellers' total cash, accounts receivable, notes
receivable and inventory less the Sellers' total  accounts
payable and accrued expenses (other than the current portion of
any intercompany accounts) (any of which amounts may be a
negative number), in each case to the extent that any of such
liabilities constitute Assumed Liabilities, determined from the
Closing Balance Sheet.  The Closing Balance Sheet and the
Estimated Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared using the same
principles and methodologies used by Sellers immediately prior
to the Closing Date to the extent such principles and
methodologies are in accordance with GAAP.

			(iii) If Actual Closing Working Capital
exceeds Estimated Closing Working Capital, Buyer shall, within
thirty (30) days pay to Sellers the amount of such excess.  If
Actual Closing Working Capital is less than Estimated Closing
Working Capital, Sellers shall within thirty (30) days pay to
Buyer in immediately available funds the amount of such
shortfall.  All amounts owed pursuant to this subsection (iii)
shall include interest, from the Closing Date to the date of
payment, at the Prime Rate (as defined in Section 8.6(g) below)
calculated on the basis of a 365-day year.

			(iv) If Sellers disagree with any item on
the Closing Balance Sheet, Sellers shall notify Buyer in writing
of such disagreement within thirty (30) days after Sellers'
receipt thereof (such notice setting forth in reasonable detail
the basis for such disagreement).  Buyer shall permit Sellers
access to such work papers relating to the preparation of the
Closing Balance Sheet as may be reasonably necessary to permit
Sellers to review in detail the manner in which the Closing
Balance Sheet was prepared.  Buyer and Sellers shall thereafter
negotiate in good faith to resolve any such disagreements;
provided, however, that Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall within thirty (30) days pay to Buyer or Sellers, as the
case may be, the amount determined pursuant to subsection (iii)
above which is not subject to dispute, if any.  If Buyer and
Sellers are unable to resolve any such disagreements within
thirty (30) days, Buyer and Sellers shall jointly retain KPMG
Peat Marwick (the "Auditor").

			(v) Buyer and Sellers shall direct the
Auditor to render a determination within thirty (30) days of its
retention and Buyer and Sellers shall use their best efforts to
cause the Auditor to resolve all disagreements over individual
line items as soon as possible.  The Auditor shall consider only
those items and amounts in the Closing Balance Sheet which Buyer
and Sellers are unable to resolve.  The determination of the
Auditor shall be conclusive and binding upon Buyer and Sellers.
The fees and expenses of the Auditor shall be borne one-half by
Buyer and one-half by Sellers.

thereof within 1 year after the Closing Date, except for claims
arising from breaches of the representations and warranties set

		(d) Buyer agrees to indemnify Parent and Sellers
and hold Parent and Sellers harmless from and against any Loss
which Parent or Sellers may suffer, sustain or become subject
to, (i) as the result of a breach of any (A) representation or
warranty, or (B) covenant or agreement by Buyer contained in

		(e) If a party hereto seeks indemnification
under this Section 8.2, such party (the "Indemnified Party")
shall give written notice to the other party (the "Indemnifying
Party") of the facts and circumstances giving rise to the claim.
In that regard, if any suit, action, claim, liability or
obligation shall be brought or asserted by any third party
which, if adversely determined, would entitle the Indemnified
Party to indemnity pursuant to this Section 8.2, the Indemnified
Party shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party of the same
in writing, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such
claim and the facts pertaining thereto and the Indemnifying
Party, if it so elects (except that the Indemnifying Party may
not so elect without the Indemnified Party's consent unless (i)
the Indemnifying Party provides reasonable evidence to the
Indemnified Party of its financial ability to satisfy its
indemnification obligations, (ii) the suit, action, claim,
liability or obligation does not seek to impose any liability or
obligation upon the Indemnified Party other than for money

obligation does not relate to the Indemnified Party's
relationship with its customers or employees), shall assume and
control the defense thereof (and shall consult with the
Indemnified Party with respect thereto), including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified
Party and the payment of expenses. If the Indemnifying Party
elects to assume and control the defense, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right to employ counsel separate from counsel
employed by the Indemnifying Party in any such action and to
participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of
such counsel employed by the Indemnified Party shall be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party unless (y) the employment
thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying
Party in writing or (z) the Indemnifying Party has failed to
assume the defense and employ counsel. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any settlement of any action or
proceeding, the defense of which it has elected to assume, which
settlement is effected without the written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. If there shall be a settlement to which the
Indemnifying Party consents or a final judgment for the
plaintiff in any action or proceeding, the Indemnifying Party
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Indemnified Party from and
against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or
judgment.

		(f) The amount of any Loss subject to
indemnification hereunder or of any claim therefor shall be
calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit inuring to Buyer, the
Sellers or any of their Affiliates on account of such Loss and
(ii) any insurance proceeds (net of direct collection expenses)
received or receivable by Buyer, the Sellers and, its
Subsidiaries on account of such Loss. If Buyer, the Sellers or
any of their Affiliates receives a Tax Benefit after an
indemnification payment is made, Buyer shall promptly pay to the
Sellers the amount of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as
and to the extent that such Tax Benefit is realized.  For
purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall mean any refund of Taxes
paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which otherwise would
have been paid, in each case computed at the highest marginal
tax rates. Buyer and the Sellers shall seek full recovery under
all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent as



						 30
<PAGE>

they would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification
hereunder.  In the event that an insurance recovery is made by
Buyer, the Sellers or any of their Affiliates with respect to
any Loss for which any such Person has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the
recovery (net of all direct collection expenses) shall be made
promptly to the Sellers.

		(g) All indemnification payments made hereunder
shall be treated by all parties as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

		(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Section 8.2, there shall be no recovery for
any Loss by Buyer under this Section 8.2, and the Loss shall not
be included in meeting the stated thresholds hereunder, to the
extent such item has been included in the calculation of Actual
Closing Working Capital as determined pursuant to Section 1.2
hereof.

	8.3 Exclusive Remedy.

		(a) Following the Closing, except with respect
to claims based upon intentional misrepresentation, the
indemnification provided by Section 8.2 shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy to the exclusion of all other remedies and
recourse at law or otherwise under or in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated herein, including
without limitation, for any Losses of the Buyer Group or the
Sellers Group with respect to any alleged misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representations or warranties
or any breach or failure in performance of any covenants or
agreements made by Buyer or Sellers in this Agreement or in any
Exhibit, Schedule or Updated Schedule attached hereto or any
certificate delivered hereunder.  Except as provided in Section
8.2, no claim shall be brought or maintained by Buyer or Sellers
or their respective successors or permitted assigns against any
officer, director or employee (present or former) of Sellers,
and no recourse shall be brought or granted against any of them,
by virtue of or based upon any alleged misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations,
warranties or covenants of Sellers set forth or contained in
this Agreement or any certificate delivered hereunder, except to
the extent that the same shall have been the result of fraud by
any such person (and in the event of such fraud, such recourse
shall be brought or granted solely against the person or persons
committing such fraud), and provided that without limiting the
foregoing, in no event shall Buyer, its successors or permitted
assigns be entitled to claim or seek consequential damages or
any rescission of the transactions consummated under this
Agreement or other remedy at law or in equity.  In no event
shall any officer, director or employee of any of the Sellers
have any shared or vicarious liability for the actions or
omissions of any other person.

		(b) Buyer, the Sellers and their respective successors
and permitted assigns, hereby waive any right to seek
contribution or other recovery from any officer, director or
employee (present or former) of any of the Sellers, that any of
them may now or in the future have under any Environmental
Requirements, including, without limitation, the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, the
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the
Clean Air Act, any analogous state law, and any common law
providing for any remedy or right of recovery with respect to
environmental matters.  Buyer, the Sellers and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, hereby release all officers,
directors or employees (present or former) of any of the Sellers
from any and all such claims,



						 31
<PAGE>

demands, and causes of action, that any of them may now or in
the future have under such Environmental Requirements.

	8.4 Disclosure Generally.  If and to the extent any
information required to be furnished in any schedule is
contained in this Agreement or in any Schedule (or Updated
Schedule) attached hereto, such information shall be deemed to
be included in all Schedules (or Updated Schedules) in which the
information is required to be included (but only to the extent
such information can reasonably be determined to relate to the
other Schedules).  The inclusion of any information in any
Schedule (or Updated Schedule) attached hereto shall not be
deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment by the Sellers that
such information is material to or outside the ordinary course
of the business of the Sellers.

	8.5 Acknowledgment by Buyer.  THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES BY SELLERS EXPRESSLY AND SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH IN
THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE SCHEDULES (AND UPDATED SCHEDULES)
ATTACHED HERETO, CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLERS TO BUYER IN
CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND BUYER
UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY RELATING TO THE
FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,
ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE SELLERS, EXCEPT FOR THE
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES SPECIFICALLY SET FORTH HEREIN)
ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY SELLERS.

	8.6 Arbitration Procedures.

		(a) The parties hereto agree that the
arbitration procedure set forth below shall be the sole and
exclusive method for resolving and remedying claims for money
damages arising out of this Agreement (the "Disputes"), except
as otherwise provided by Section 1.2 above. Nothing in this
Section 8.6 shall prohibit a party hereto from instituting
litigation to enforce any Final Determination (as defined in
subsection (e) below) or availing itself of the other remedies
set forth in Sections 9.5(c) and 9.9(d) below.  The parties
hereto hereby agree and acknowledge that, except as otherwise
provided in this Section 8.6 or in the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as in effect from
time to time, the arbitration procedures and any Final
Determination hereunder shall be governed by, and shall be
enforced pursuant to the Uniform Arbitration Act of the State of
Florida.

		(b) In the event that any party hereto asserts
that there exists a Dispute, such party shall deliver a written
notice to each other party involved therein specifying the
nature of the asserted Dispute and requesting a meeting to
attempt to resolve the same. If no such resolution is reached
within ten (10) business days after such delivery of such
notice, the party delivering such notice of Dispute (the
"Disputing Person") may, within forty-five (45) business days
after delivery of such notice, commence arbitration hereunder by
delivering to each other party involved therein a notice of
arbitration (a "Notice of Arbitration").  Such Notice of



						32
<PAGE>

Arbitration shall specify the matters as to which arbitration is
sought, the nature of any Dispute, the claims of each party to
the arbitration and shall specify the amount and nature of any
damages, if any, sought to be recovered as a result of any
alleged claim, and any other matters required by the Commercial
Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, as in
effect from time to time, to be included therein, if any.

		(c) Buyer and Sellers shall each select one
independent arbitrator expert in the subject matter of the
Dispute (the arbitrators so selected shall be referred to herein
as "Buyer's Arbitrator" and "Sellers' Arbitrator,"
respectively). In the event that either party fails to select an
independent arbitrator as set forth herein within twenty (20)
days from delivery of a Notice of Arbitration, then the matter
shall be resolved by the arbitrator selected by the other party.
Sellers' Arbitrator and Buyer's Arbitrator shall select a third
independent arbitrator expert in the subject matter of the
dispute, and the three arbitrators so selected shall resolve the
matter according to the procedures set forth in this Section
8.6.  If Sellers' Arbitrator and Buyer's Arbitrator are unable
to agree on a third arbitrator within twenty (20) days after
their selection, Sellers' Arbitrator and Buyer's Arbitrator
shall each prepare a list of three independent arbitrators.
Sellers' Arbitrator and Buyer's Arbitrator shall each have the
opportunity to designate as objectionable and eliminate one
arbitrator from the other arbitrator's list within seven days
after submission thereof, and the third arbitrator shall then be
selected by lot from the arbitrators remaining on the lists
submitted by Sellers' Arbitrator and Buyer's Arbitrator.

		(d) The arbitrator(s) selected pursuant to
subsection (c) above will determine the allocation of the costs
and expenses of arbitration based upon the percentage which the
portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears
to the amount actually contested by such party. For example, if
Buyer submits a claim for $1,000, and if Sellers contest only
$500 of the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the arbitrator(s)
ultimately resolves the dispute by awarding Buyer $300 of the
$500 contested, then the costs and expenses of arbitration will
be allocated 60% (i.e. 300 ? 500) to Sellers and 40% (i.e. 200 ?
500) to Buyer.

		(e) The arbitration shall be conducted under the
Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
Association as in effect from time to time, except as modified
by the agreement of all parties. The arbitrator(s) shall so
conduct the arbitration that a final result, determination,
finding, judgment and/or award (the "Final Determination") is
made or rendered as soon as practicable, but in no event later
than the later of ninety (90) business days after the delivery
of the Notice of Arbitration and ten (10) days following
completion of the arbitration. The Final Determination must be
agreed upon and signed by the sole arbitrator or by at least two
of the three arbitrators (as the case may be). The Final
Determination shall be final and binding on all parties and
there shall be no appeal from or reexamination of the Final
Determination, except for fraud, perjury, evident partiality or
misconduct by an arbitrator prejudicing the rights of any party
and except to correct manifest clerical errors.

		(f) Buyer and Sellers may enforce any Final
Determination in any state or federal court having jurisdiction
over the Dispute.  For the purpose of any action or proceeding
instituted with respect to any Final Determination, each party
hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of such
courts, irrevocably consents to the service of process by
registered mail or personal service and hereby irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any


						33
<PAGE>

objection which it may have or hereafter have as to personal
jurisdiction, the laying of the venue of any such action or
proceeding brought in any such court and any claim that any such
action or proceeding brought in such court has been brought in
any inconvenient forum.

		(g) If any party shall fail to pay the amount of
any damages, if any, assessed against it within ten (10) days of
the delivery to such party of such Final Determination, the
unpaid amount shall bear interest from the date of such delivery
at the lesser of(i) the prime rate, as declared by Citibank,
N.A. from time to time (which rate shall be adjusted on the
effective date of each change in such rate) (the "Prime Rate")
plus 300 basis points and (ii) the maximum rate permitted by
applicable usury laws. Interest on any such unpaid amount shall
be compounded semiannually, computed on the basis of a 365-day
year and shall be payable on demand. In addition, such party
shall promptly reimburse the other party for all reasonable
costs or expenses of any nature or kind whatsoever (including
but not limited to reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in
seeking to collect such damages or to enforce any Final
Determination.

					ARTICLE IX

				ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

	9.1 Tax Matters.  The following provisions shall
govern the allocation of responsibility as between Buyer and
Sellers for certain tax matters following the Closing Date:

		(a) Allocation of Purchase Price.  The Parties
agree that the Purchase Price and the liabilities of the Sellers
(plus other relevant items) will be allocated to the assets of
the Sellers for all purposes (including Tax and financial
accounting purposes) in a manner consistent with the fair market
values of such assets as determined by mutual agreement of the
parties hereto and set forth in Schedule 9.1(a) attached hereto.
Buyer and Sellers will file all Tax Returns (including amended
returns and claims for refund) and information reports in a
manner consistent with such values.

		(b) Cooperation on Tax Matters.

			(i) Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate
fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other
party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns of, or which
include, the Sellers and any audit, litigation or other
proceeding with respect to Taxes.  Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the
provision of records and information which are reasonably
relevant to any such audit, litigation or other proceeding and
making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.  The Sellers agree (A) to retain all books
and records with respect to Tax matters and pertinent to the
Sellers relating to any taxable period beginning before the
Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations
(and, to the extent notified by Buyer, any extensions thereof)
of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record
retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and
(B) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring , destroying or discarding any such books and
records and, if the other party so requests, the Sellers shall
allow the other party to take possession of such books and
records.



						 34
<PAGE>

				(ii) Buyer and Sellers further agree, upon
request, to use their best efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any governmental authority or any other
Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed (including, but not limited to, with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

		(c) Certain Taxes.  All transfer, documentary,
sales, use, stamp, registration and other such Taxes and fees
(including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection
with this Agreement, shall be paid by Buyer when due, and Buyer
will, at its own expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and
other documentation with respect to all such transfer,
documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other Taxes and
fees, and, if required by applicable law, Sellers will, and will
cause their affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax
Returns and other documentation.

	9.2 Employee and Employee Benefit Matters.  Effective
as of the Closing Date, the employees of the Sellers (the
"Continued Employees") shall cease to be covered under the
employee benefit plans of Sellers and shall participate under
the employee benefit plans, programs and policies established by
the Buyer.  To the extent permitted under the Buyer's' employee
benefit plans, the Continued Employees shall be covered under
the employee benefit plans without any exclusion for pre-
existing conditions and shall recognize the employees' service
with Sellers for purposes of vesting and eligibility under such
plans.

	9.3 Press Releases and Announcements.  Prior to the
Closing Date, no press releases related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, or other announcements to
the employees, customers or suppliers of the Sellers will be
issued without the mutual approval of all parties hereto, except
for any public disclosure which any party in good faith believes
is required by law or regulation (in which case the disclosure
shall be prepared jointly by the Sellers and Buyer). After the
Closing Date, no press releases related to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated herein, or other announcements to
the employees, customers or suppliers of the Sellers will be
issued without Buyer's consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld).

	9.4 Further Transfers.  Sellers will execute and
deliver such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and
take such additional action as Buyer may reasonably request to
effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the transfer to Buyer of
the Acquired Assets and any other transactions contemplated
hereby.

	9.5 Investigation and Confidentiality.

		(a) Prior to the Closing Date, Buyer may make or
cause to be made such investigation of the business and
properties of the Sellers as it deems necessary or advisable to
familiarize itself therewith; provided that such investigation
shall be (i) reasonably related to the transactions contemplated
thereby and (ii) conducted in a manner as not to interfere
unreasonably with the normal business operations of the Sellers.
Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers will cause their officers,
directors and employees to permit Buyer, its employees and
authorized representatives and representatives of the financial
institutions which are considering participation in the
financing of this transaction to (i) have full access to the
premises, books and records of the Sellers at reasonable hours,
(ii) visit and inspect any of the properties of the Sellers, and



						 35
<PAGE>

(iii) discuss the affairs, finances and accounts of the Sellers
with the directors, officers, key employees of the Sellers.

		(b) If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are not consummated, Buyer will not disclose or use at
any time any information and materials reasonably designated by
Sellers as confidential (except that confidential information
shall not include (i) information which is publicly available
through no fault of Buyer, or (ii) information already known to
Buyer or obtained by Buyer from a third party not bound by any
duty of confidentiality to Sellers), and Buyer and its
representatives will return to Sellers originals of and destroy
copies of all memoranda, notes, plans, records, documentation
and other materials obtained from Sellers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement which Buyer may then
possess or have under its control. Whether or not the
transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, Sellers will
maintain the confidentiality of all information and materials
regarding Buyer and its affiliates reasonably designated by
Buyer as confidential. If the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated, Sellers will maintain the
confidentiality of, and will not use for any purpose, all
proprietary and other non-public information regarding the
Sellers (including, without limitation, any of same included in
the Intellectual Property), except as necessary to file tax
returns and other reports to governmental agencies, and to turn
over to Buyer at the Closing copies of all such materials it has
in its possession. In the event that Sellers are requested or
required (by oral question or request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena,
civil investigative demand, or similar process) to disclose any
such information, Sellers will notify Buyer promptly of the
request or requirement so that Buyer may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with the provisions of this
Section 9.5.  If, in the absence of a protective order or the
receipt of a waiver hereunder, Sellers are, on the advice of
counsel, compelled to disclose any information to any tribunal
or else stand liable for contempt, Sellers may disclose the
information to the tribunal; provided, however, that Sellers
shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at
the request of Buyer, an order or other assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded to such portion of the
information required to be disclosed as Buyer shall designate.
This Section 9.5 shall survive any expiration or termination of
this Agreement.

		(c) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that in the event of a breach by any party of any of the
provisions of this Section 9.5, monetary damages will not
constitute a sufficient remedy. Consequently, in the event of
any such breach, any non-breaching party and/or their respective
successors or assigns may, in addition to other rights and
remedies existing in their favor, apply to any court of law or
equity of competent jurisdiction for specific performance and/or
injunctive or other relief in order to enforce or prevent any
violations of the provisions hereof, in each case without the
requirement of posting a bond or proving actual damages.

	9.6 Expenses.  Sellers will pay the cost of the title
commitments required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to
Section 2.1(i), and Buyer shall pay the premiums for any title
insurance policies that Buyer elects to obtain.  Sellers and
Buyer will each pay one-half of the costs of any surveys
obtained by Sellers in order to obtain the title commitments
required to be delivered to Buyer pursuant to Section 2.1(i).
Except as set forth in the preceding sentences of this
Section 9.6 and as otherwise provided in this Agreement, Buyer
and Sellers will pay all of their


						 36
<PAGE>

own fees, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment bankers,
brokers or other representatives and consultants and appraisal
fees, costs and expenses) incurred in connection with the
negotiation of this Agreement, the performance of its
obligations hereunder, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

	9.7 Exclusivity.  Except as provided in this Section
9.7 and subject to the fiduciary duties of the boards of
directors of Sellers, until this Agreement is terminated by its
terms, Sellers will not (and Sellers will not cause or permit
any affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent of the
Sellers or their affiliates to), (a) solicit, initiate or
encourage the submission of any proposal or offer from any
person or entity (including any of them) relating to any (i)
liquidation, dissolution or recapitalization of, (ii) merger or
consolidation, (iii) acquisition or purchase of assets of or any
equity interest in or (iv) similar transaction or business
combination involving, the Sellers or (b) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish any information
with respect to, assist or participate in, or facilitate in any
other manner any effort or attempt by any other Person to do or
seek any of the foregoing. Until this Agreement is terminated by
its terms, Sellers shall notify Buyer immediately if any Person
makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to
any of the foregoing.

	9.8 Books and Records.  Unless otherwise consented to
in writing by Sellers or Buyer (as the case may be), Buyer and
Sellers will not, for a period of seven (7) years following the
date hereof, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any of the
books and records of the Sellers acquired by Buyer hereunder or
retained by Sellers without first offering to surrender to
Sellers or Buyer such books and records or any portion thereof
of which Sellers or Buyer may intend to destroy, alter or
dispose of. Buyer and Sellers will allow the other party's
representatives, attorneys and accountants access to such books
and records, upon reasonable request and during such party's
normal business hours, for the purpose of examining and copying
the same in connection with any matter whether or not relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

	9.9 Accounts Receivable.  In the event that any of
the accounts receivable on the Closing Balance Sheet remain
uncollected for more than 120 days following the Closing Date,
Buyer at its option may re-assign those accounts receivable to
Sellers, and Sellers shall pay to Buyer the face amount of such
accounts receivable less the amount of any reserves as set forth
on the Closing Balance Sheet.
