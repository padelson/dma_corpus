Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares upon
surrender of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with Section
1.8; and

Time and held by a holder who has properly demanded appraisal rights in
respect of such shares, and has not effectively withdrawn such demand, in each
case in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
will not be converted into or represent the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but their holder will instead be entitled to such rights as are
afforded under the DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, unless such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | If any holder of shares of Class A Common Stock who demands
appraisal of such holders shares pursuant to the DGCL fails to perfect or
withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal, at the later
of the Effective Time or upon the occurrence of such event, such holders
Dissenting Shares will be converted into and will represent the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, in accordance with
Section 1.5(b). 
---|---|--- 
 



4 ---|---|---

such Option and (ii) the total number of shares of Class A Common Stock
underlying such Option. All such payments with respect to each Option shall be

5 Effective Time and (B) the last day of the Surviving Corporations first
regular payroll cycle following the Closing). 
---|--- 



     | (c) | _Non-Director Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective
Time, each restricted stock unit granted under a Stock Plan that is not a
Director RSU and that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(each, an " _Unvested RSU_ ") shall be converted to a right to receive a cash
payment equal to the product of (i) the Merger Consideration, without

     | (1) | a letter of transmittal (which will be in customary form and
reviewed by the Company prior to delivery thereof) specifying that delivery

Entry Shares held by such holder will pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent; and

---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8 and
at any time after the Effective Time, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share
held by Public Stockholders (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration allocable to the shares represented by such Certificate or Book-

for Merger Consideration to which such holders may be entitled. 
---|---|---

Section 1.8, only upon: 
---|---|---

destruction by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed; and 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | if required by the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange
Agent, either (A) the posting by such Person of a bond in such amount as the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably require as indemnity against any claim

Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign tax Law with respect to the making of
such payment. Any amounts so deducted and withheld by the Sprint Parties, the

shares of Class A Common Stock, Options or RSUs in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made for all purposes.

holder of such Warrant would have been entitled to receive in the Merger had
the holder thereof exercised such Warrant in full immediately prior to the
Effective Time based on the exercise price set forth in the applicable
Warrant. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall

duties under applicable Law, and (ii) the facts, circumstances, developments,
events or occurrences underlying such intended change (the "Underlying Basis")
were not known to the Special Committee or the Board of Directors of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement or if known, the consequences
of such Underlying Basis shall not have been reasonably foreseeable, (B)
after such determination in clause (A), the Company has notified Sprint in
writing that it intends to make an Adverse Company Board Recommendation (a "

detailed explanation for such Adverse Company Board Recommendation, and (C)
during the five (5) Business Day period commencing upon the Companys delivery

Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement, and nothing
contained herein (unless this Agreement is otherwise terminated in accordance

Subsidiaries, (II) Sprint Regulatory Adverse Effect shall be the level of, and
shall be measured as to, what would be reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and not the level or measure of what would be reasonably likely to
have a material adverse effect on Sprint and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and (III) the effect shall be with respect to Sprint and its
Subsidiaries. Upon the request of Sprint, and only upon the request of
Sprint, the Company shall agree to any and all divestitures of spectrum and

as such divestitures and Restrictions are conditioned on the Closing. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | The Company shall, upon Sprints request and at Sprints
expense, cooperate with Sprint and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things

obligations on the Company prior to Closing) to enter into agreements or take
board actions not contingent on the Closing or that would be effective prior

and its Subsidiaries from and against any and all liabilities, losses,

such conditions, enforce all of its rights under the Sprint-SoftBank Merger
Agreement (or any other definitive agreements related thereto) in an attempt
to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Sprint-SoftBank Merger
Agreement at or prior to the End Date (as it may be extended) of the Sprint-
SoftBank Merger Agreement. Sprint will keep the Company informed on a
reasonable basis and in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
consummate, and the status of, the transactions contemplated by the Sprint-
SoftBank Merger Agreement, and will provide the Company, as promptly as
reasonably practicable upon request, with updates as to the status and timing
of the transactions contemplated by the Sprint-SoftBank 

 



45  Merger Agreement. Sprint will notify the Company promptly and in any event
within twenty-four hours upon having Knowledge (which definition of Knowledge
shall, for purposes of this Section 4.5, not include an obligation of
reasonable inquiry) of any notice of breach or of threatened breach (written
or otherwise) received or delivered by Sprint or any notice of termination or
of threatened termination (written or otherwise) of the Sprint-SoftBank
Merger Agreement received or delivered by Sprint. Subject to Sprint Fiduciary
Duties and applicable Law, Sprint will not amend, modify, supplement or waive
any of the conditions to the Sprint-SoftBank Merger Agreement or any other
material provision of, or remedies under, the Sprint-SoftBank Merger
Agreement, in each case to the extent such amendment, modification, supplement
or waiver could reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the consummation
of the transactions contemplated thereby beyond the End Date (as defined in
the Sprint-SoftBank Merger Agreement) as it may be extended. Subject to the
Sprint Fiduciary duties, Sprint shall not terminate the Sprint-SoftBank Merger
Agreement other than in connection with entering into a Replacement Sprint

otherwise pertaining to the business and affairs, of the Company and (ii) make
available for inspection by Sprint and its counsel, financial advisors,
auditors and other authorized representatives such financial and operating

or pursuant to this Section 4.6, shall affect any representation or warranty
in this Agreement of any Party or any condition to the obligations of any
Party. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Nothing contained in this Section 4.6 shall require the
Company to permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable, good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may
be in-house counsel) of the Company would reasonably be expected to result in
any violation of any Material Contract or Law to which the Company or its
Subsidiaries is subject ( _provided_ that the Company shall in good faith use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain consent to such access or disclosure
under any such Contract) or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to
assert to be undermined with respect to such information and such undermining
of such privilege could in the Companys good faith judgment (after
consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in
any material respect the Companys position in any pending or, what the
Company believes in good faith (after consultation with counsel, which may be
in-house counsel) could be, future litigation. 
---|---|--- 
 



46 Section 4.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. From and after the date of
this Agreement until the Effective Time, each Party shall promptly notify the
other Parties of:

which seeks to prohibit, prevent or materially delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
---|---|--- 

in each case, to the extent such event or circumstance is or becomes known to
the Party required to give such notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 4.7 shall not be deemed to be
an amendment of this Agreement and shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure Schedule or the Sprint
Disclosure Schedule. The notification obligations in this Section 4.7 shall
not constitute an undertaking or covenant for purposes of this Agreement,
including an undertaking or an agreement for purposes of Sections 5.2(b) and
5.3(b).

Section 4.8. _Public Announcements_. The Parties have agreed upon the form and
substance of press releases announcing the execution of this Agreement and the

will permit any of its Affiliates to, issue or cause the publication of any
press release or other public announcement with respect to, or otherwise make
any public statement concerning, this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement without the prior consent (which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld) of the other Parties, except that any Party may,
without the prior consent of any other Party, issue or cause the publication
of any press release or other public announcement to the extent it determines
that so doing is or may be required by Law or by the rules and regulations of
a stock exchange or by its fiduciary duty, or any public filing contemplated
by Sections 4.2 or 4.3. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
restrictions set forth in this Section 4.8 will not apply to any release or
public statement made or proposed to be made by any of the Parties in
connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding this Agreement, the
Merger, the transaction contemplated by this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by the Note Purchase Agreement.

 



47 Section 4.9. _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

 



     | (a) | It is understood and agreed that all rights to
indemnification, expense advancement, and exculpation existing in favor of
each present and former director, officer and employee of the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries as provided in the Companys Certificate of
Incorporation or Bylaws or the charter or organizational documents of the
Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect on the date of
this Agreement, or under any other agreements in effect on the date of this
Agreement (true, correct and complete copies of which have been delivered to
Sprint), will survive the Merger and the Surviving Corporation will, and
Sprint will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) continue in full force
and effect for a period of at least 6 years from the Effective Time (or, if
any relevant claim is asserted or made within such six year period, until
final disposition of such claim) such rights to indemnification and (ii)
perform, in a timely manner, the Surviving Corporations obligation with
respect thereto. Any claims for indemnification pursuant to such agreements
and organizational documents as to which the Surviving Corporation has
received written notice before the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time
will survive, whether or not those claims will have been finally adjudicated
or settled, and no action taken during such period may be deemed to diminish
the obligations set forth in this Section 4.9. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | The Surviving Corporation will maintain in effect for 6
years from the Effective Time the current directors and officers liability
insurance policies applicable to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(except the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of at least
the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less favorable)
providing coverage with respect to matters occurring before the Effective
Time and such policies or endorsements must name as insureds thereunder all
present and former directors, officers and employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, except that in no event will the Surviving Corporation
be required to expend under this Section 4.9(b) more than an amount per year
equal to three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums paid by the
Company for that insurance. If, but for the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, the Surviving Corporation would be required to expend more
than three hundred percent (300%) of current annual premiums, the Surviving
Entity will obtain the maximum amount of that insurance obtainable by
payment of annual premiums equal to three hundred percent (300%) of current
annual premiums. To the extent that a "tail" policy is available that complies
with the foregoing requirements of this Section 4.9(b) with respect to
the coverage, terms, and conditions applicable to all present and former
directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
the Surviving Corporation may satisfy its obligation under this Section 4.9(b)
by obtaining such policy. 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | If the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and will not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of that consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision will be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 4.9. 
---|---|--- 
 



48 Section 4.10. _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Parties shall give the
other the reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of any
stockholder litigation against any Party or their respective directors and
officers, as applicable, relating to this Agreement and the transactions

service with the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective

Continuing Employee participates for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), to the extent past
service was recognized for such Continuing Employees under the comparable
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 4.14(b) shall be construed to require
crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication of benefits, (ii)
service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit pension plan, or

payments and deductibles paid prior to any such change in satisfying any
applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements after such change.

Disclosure Schedule. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Notwithstanding anything in this Section 4.14 to the
contrary, but subject to Section 4.14(a), nothing contained herein, whether
express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment or other modification of
any employee benefit plan of Sprint or its Affiliates, or shall limit the
right of Sprint or its Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any
particular employee benefit plan of Sprint or its Affiliates following the
Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 



     | (f) | The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that all provisions
contained in this Section 4.14 are included for the sole benefit of the
Parties hereto, and that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any
other Person, including any employees or former employees of the Company, any
Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee,
or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with
Sprint or any of its Affiliates. 
---|---|---

earlier termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Sprint

Affiliate, (b) a conversion of Class B Common Stock into Class A Common Stock
or (c) a transfer to the Company pursuant to an election under Section
2.13(j) of the Company Equityholders Agreement, provided that Sprint shall
revoke any such election prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting), sell,
