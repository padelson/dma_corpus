the fee letter referenced above and any engagement letters or fee discount letters related to the Financing, which will not have an adverse impact on the funding of the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter at or prior to
the Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and such Commitment Letter). As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of Parent, and, to the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties thereto, except as limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors&#146; rights generally and by general principles of equity. There are no conditions precedent (including pursuant to any &#147;flex&#148; provisions) related to the funding of the full
amount of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter. Assuming the Financing is funded in accordance with the Commitment Letter, and together with cash on hand at Parent, the Company
and their respective Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient for the payment of the aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to Article II
hereof, the funding of any required refinancings or repayments of any existing Indebtedness of the Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger and the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid
by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with this Agreement and the Financing (the &#147;<U>Required Amount</U>&#148;). As of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, (i)&nbsp;no event has occurred which would
constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default) or result in a failure to satisfy a condition precedent, in each case, on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other
party to the Commitment Letter, under the Commitment Letter, and (ii)&nbsp;Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the
Closing Date. Each of Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees or other fees to the extent required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the
Financing. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;4.21. <U>Brokers</U>. Other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner&nbsp;&amp; Smith Incorporated, neither Parent nor
