v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 15, 2014 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made and entered into by and among ALBEMARLE CORPORATION,
a Virginia corporation (" _Parent_ "), ROCKWOOD HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware
corporation (the " _Company_ "), and ALBEMARLE HOLDINGS CORPORATION, a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"). Parent, Merger Sub and the Company are referred to individually as a "
_Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parties_."

 

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, the Parties intend that, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company,
with the Company surviving the merger as the surviving corporation (the "
_Merger_ ");

WHEREAS, the Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have
each determined it is advisable to engage in the transactions contemplated
hereby; and

 

WHEREAS, Parent, the Company and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements specified herein
in connection with this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and intending to be
legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

 _THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law
of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Sub will cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). As a result of the Merger, the
Surviving Corporation shall become a wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent.

 

Section 1.2. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at the offices of Shearman and Sterling LLP, 599 Lexington Avenue,
New York, New York 10022, at 9:00 a.m. local time, on the second Business Day
following the satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions
that by their nature can only be satisfied on the Closing Date, but subject to
the satisfaction of such conditions or valid waiver by the Party entitled to
waive such conditions), or at such other place, time and date as may be
agreed to by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware the certificate of merger relating
to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "),

 



1  executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL. The Merger
shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or at such
later time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the
Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective
Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, at
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights,
powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all of the
obligations, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub, all as
provided under the DGCL.

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Company
shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law (subject
to Section 5.10).

 

(b) At the Effective Time, the by-laws of Merger Sub shall be the by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation, except the references to Merger Subs name shall
be replaced by references to "Rockwood Holdings, Inc.", until such by-laws are
amended in accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law (subject
to Section 5.10).

 

Section 1.6. _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all actions necessary,
including obtaining and delivering resignations of each of the directors of
the Company (effective as of the Effective Time) so that the directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the
Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the
earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may
be.

ARTICLE II

 

 _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger Sub_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any holder of any Securities of the Company
or Merger Sub:

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or
otherwise) or Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
automatically cancelled and shall 

 



2  cease to exist (other than any shares of Company Common Stock held by any
wholly-owned Company Subsidiary, which shall remain outstanding as shares of
the Surviving Corporation) and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(a), (ii) shares held by any wholly-owned Company
Subsidiary, and (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, Appraisal
Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive (x) $50.65 in cash,
without interest (such amount of cash, the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ "), and
(y) 0.4803 (such ratio, the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable share of Parent Common Stock (and, if applicable, cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with
Section 2.3) (the consideration payable in accordance with this Section
2.1(b), collectively, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) All shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.1 shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of (1) a certificate that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or (2) any such shares of Company
Common Stock held in book entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive (A) the
Merger Consideration and (B) any other amounts expressly provided herein,
without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures set forth in
Section 2.5.

 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.2. _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (i)
the Effective Time or (ii) any termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Article VII, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction, or a stock dividend
thereon shall be declared with a record date within said period, then the Per
Share Cash Amount, the Exchange Ratio and any other similarly dependent items,
as the case may be, shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the
holders of Company Common Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable
for Company Common Stock or Company RSUs that may be settled with Company
Common Stock) the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be construed to permit any
Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or restricted by any
other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.3. _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent 

 



3  Common Stock. All fractional shares of Parent Common Stock which a holder of
Company Common Stock would be otherwise entitled to receive (after taking into
account all shares of Company Common Stock exchanged by such holder) shall be
aggregated and calculations shall be rounded to three decimal places. In lieu
of any such fractional shares, each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to such fractional shares shall be entitled to receive
an amount in cash, without interest, representing such holders proportionate
interest in the net proceeds from the sale of shares of Parent Common Stock
representing all such fractional shares (the " _Excess Shares_ ") by the
Exchange Agent on behalf of all such holders in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.5(a). The amount of cash which each holder of Company
Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock shall be entitled to receive shall be an amount equal to (a) the
net proceeds of such sale(s) of Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent multiplied
by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of fractional
interests to which such holder of shares of Company Common Stock would
otherwise be entitled and the denominator of which is the aggregate number of
Excess Shares. As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional share interests in Parent Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall
make available such amounts, without interest, to the holders of Company
Common Stock entitled to receive such cash following the procedures in
Section 2.5(b).

Section 2.4. _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1 and the holders
of such Appraisal Shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may be
granted to such holders pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise
shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, then
such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to
receive, the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1. The Company
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by
the Company. Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 2.5. _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement (which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company) with a
nationally recognized financial institution designated by Parent and
reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At or
immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company Common
Stock (i) for exchange in accordance with this Article II, through the
Exchange Agent, subject to Section 2.5(b)(ii),

 



4  book-entry shares (or certificates if requested) representing the full
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.1
in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and (ii) cash in
an aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration, and Parent shall, after the Effective Time on the appropriate
payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be provided to the Exchange
Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent
Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (such shares of Parent Common Stock
and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or other
distributions with respect thereto, are hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of such deposit, Parent shall assume that
there will not be any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. The
Exchange Agent shall, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time,
(x) calculate the aggregate number of Excess Shares in accordance with Section
2.3 and (y) sell such Excess Shares on the NYSE, through one or more member
firms of the NYSE, in round lots to the extent practicable. The Exchange
Agent shall pay all commissions, transfer Taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs incurred in connection with such sale(s) of Excess Shares
out of the proceeds of such sale(s) and shall deposit the net proceeds of
such sale(s) in the Exchange Fund to be distributed to the applicable holders
entitled to cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.3.
Except as provided in Section 2.5(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for
any other purpose.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon
as reasonably practicable (but in any event within five (5) Business Days)
after the Closing Date, to each holder of record of a Certificate whose shares
of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a letter of transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such customary provisions as
Parent and the Company may reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) and
(ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate
for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver in exchange therefor as promptly as practicable, (A)
cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number
of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate,
(B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry
form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the
whole number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect
of such Certificate pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (after taking into account all
other Certificates surrendered by such holder pursuant to this Section
2.5(b)(i)), (C) any dividends or other distributions payable in respect of
such whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section
2.5(c)(i) and (D) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
payable pursuant to Section 2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
payment may be made and shares may be issued to a Person 

 



5  other than the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is
registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No
interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to this Article II. In
lieu thereof, each holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose
shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 shall automatically upon the
Effective Time be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
(A) cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the
number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-
Entry Shares, (B) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be
in book-entry form unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the
aggregate, the whole number of shares that such holder has the right to
receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (after
taking into account all other Book-Entry Shares converted by such holder
pursuant to this Section 2.5(b)(ii)), (C) any dividends or other distributions
payable in respect of such whole number of Book-Entry Shares pursuant
to Section 2.5(c)(ii) and (D) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to Section 2.3, and the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock, and no
cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder
pursuant to Section 2.3, until the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to applicable Law, following
surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(A) at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i), the amount of dividends or other distributions
with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to
such shares of Parent Common Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i), and a payment date subsequent
to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(i), payable with respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.

 



6 (ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. There shall be paid to the holder of the shares of
Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with this Article II, without interest, (A) at the time of delivery of such
Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such shares of Parent Common
Stock and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
2.5(b)(ii), and a payment date subsequent to the time of such delivery by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), payable with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock.

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, as promptly as
practicable, in the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have
been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
shares of Company Common Stock (other than the right to receive dividends or
other distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.5(c)). After the
Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Common Stock are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Article II.

 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon its demand therefor, and
any former holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied
with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of its claim for the Merger Consideration, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.5(c).

 

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash payable pursuant to this Agreement delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common
Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be

 



7  made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or
other distributions and any cash in lieu of fractional shares that would be
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.5(c) had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered as provided in this
Article II.

(h) Parent shall direct the Exchange Agent to invest the cash included in the
Exchange Fund in accordance with Parents directions, subject to the terms
and conditions of this Section 2.5(h). Any interest, gains and other income
resulting from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive property of
Parent payable to Parent upon its request, and no part of such interest,
gains and other income shall accrue to the benefit of holders of Company
Common Stock; _provided_ , _however_ , that any investment of such cash shall
in all events be limited to direct short-term obligations of, or short-term
obligations fully guaranteed as to principal and interest by, the U.S.
government, in commercial paper rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys
Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in
certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of
commercial banks with capital exceeding $10 billion (based on the most recent
financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available), and that
no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders
of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Article II. If for any reason
(including losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the
Exchange Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into the Exchange
Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash
required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any former holder of Company Common Stock, a Company Stock
Option or a Company RSU, such amounts as are required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Law. Any amount deducted or withheld
pursuant to this Section 2.5(i) and duly paid over to the applicable Tax
authority shall be treated as having been paid to the holder of such Company
Common Stock, Company Stock Option or Company RSU in respect of which such
deduction or withholding was made.

Section 2.6.  _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

(a) Each option to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stock
Option_ ") granted under any of the Company Stock Incentive Plans that is
outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
or not then vested or exercisable, shall remain outstanding following the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the Company Stock Options shall, by
virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of the Company
or the holders thereof, be assumed by Parent in such manner that Parent (i) is
a corporation "assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section
424(a) applies" within the meaning of Section 424 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder or (ii) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code does
not apply to any such Company Stock Options, would be such a corporation were
Section 424 of the Code applicable to such Company Stock Options. From and
after the Effective Time, all references to the Company in the Company Stock
Incentive 

 



8  Plans and the applicable stock option award agreements issued thereunder
shall be deemed to refer to Parent, which shall have assumed the Company Stock
Incentive Plans as of the Effective Time by virtue of this Agreement and
without any further action. Each Company Stock Option assumed by Parent (each,
a " _Substitute Option_ ") shall be exercisable upon the same terms and
conditions as under the applicable Company Stock Incentive Plan and the
applicable stock option award agreement issued thereunder, except that each
such Substitute Option shall be exercisable for, and represent the right to
acquire, that whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to
the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to the related Company Stock Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (B) the Stock Option Exchange Ratio, and
the exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the
nearest whole cent) shall equal the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Stock Option
by (y) the Stock Option Exchange Ratio; provided, that the exercise price and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to the Substitute Option
shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section
409A of the Code, and, in the case of Company Stock Options that are intended
to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the
Code, consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code. For
purposes of this Agreement, " _Stock Option Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum
of (i) the Exchange Ratio and (ii) the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the
Per Share Cash Amount by (y) the Parent Share Cash Value.

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver, or
cause to be delivered, to each holder of a Substitute Option an appropriate
notice setting forth such holders rights pursuant thereto and such Substitute
Option shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (including
any antidilution provisions, and subject to the adjustments required by
this Section 2.6 after giving effect to the Merger). Parent shall comply with
the terms of all such Substitute Options and use commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure, to the extent required by, and subject to the provisions
of, the Company Stock Plans, that Substitute Options that qualified as
incentive stock options under Section 422 of the Code prior to the Effective
Time continue to qualify as incentive stock options after the Effective Time.
Parent shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise
of Substitute Options pursuant to the terms set forth in this Section 2.6. As
soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to Substitute Options shall be covered by an effective
registration statement on Form S-8 (or any successor form) or another
appropriate form, and Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements for so long as Substitute Options remain outstanding.

 

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each performance-based stock unit
or performance-based market stock unit granted under the Company Stock
Incentive Plans (a " _Company RSU_ ") shall pursuant to the terms of the
applicable award agreement, be converted into the right to receive a cash
payment (the amount of which payment shall be calculated under the applicable
award agreement), which payment shall become vested and be paid in accordance
with the terms of the applicable award agreement, less all applicable
withholding taxes and other authorized deductions; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, for purposes of calculating the "CIC Settlement Amount" under the
applicable award agreement, the "CIC Per Share Price" shall equal the sum of
(x) the Per Share Cash Amount plus (y) the product of the Exchange Ratio
and the Parent Share Cash Value.

(d) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions as are
reasonably necessary in order to effectuate this Section 2.6; _provided_ that
such actions shall be expressly conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger and shall be of no force or effect if this Agreement is terminated or
if the transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned. In addition, all
payments to be made to employees of the Surviving Corporation in respect of
Company RSUs may be made via the Surviving Corporations payroll system.

documents filed or furnished during such period by Parent to the SEC on a
voluntary basis, the " _Parent SEC Documents_ "). No Parent Subsidiary is
subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act or is
otherwise required to make filings with the SEC.

and the Exchange Act, in each case to the extent applicable to such Parent
SEC Documents, and none of the Parent SEC Documents when filed or furnished
(or in the case of a registration statement under the Securities Act, at the
time it was declared effective) contained, or, if not yet filed or furnished,
will contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted (or will
omit) to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) utilized by Parent are
reasonably designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-
financial) required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or
submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that
all such information required to be disclosed is accumulated and communicated
to the management of Parent to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure and to enable the chief executive officer and chief
financial officer of Parent to make the certifications required under the
Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Since the Audited Balance Sheet

financial reporting of Parent, (ii) "material weakness" in the internal
controls over financial reporting of Parent or (iii) fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees of Parent who have a
significant role in the internal controls over financial reporting of Parent.

(i) that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (ii)

extent based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for

prohibited transactions imposed by such Section 4975 of the Code or to any
material liability under Section 502(i) or 502(1) of ERISA.

be in full force and effect that, individually or in the aggregate, have not
had and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Neither Parent nor any of Parent Subsidiaries is in material breach or

amendments to such letter in effect as of the date of this Agreement and a
fully executed copy of the fee letter referenced therein (provided that the
provisions in any such fee letter related solely to fees and the economic
terms of the "market flex" sections thereof agreed to by the parties may be
redacted (none of which redacted provisions relate to, or shall adversely
affect, the availability or conditionality (either by imposing new or
additional conditions or modifying any existing conditions) of the Financing
at the Closing) (such commitment letter and related term sheets, together
with all exhibits, annexes, schedules, amendments and attachments thereto, as
amended or otherwise modified only to the extent permitted by this Agreement,
collectively, the " _Commitment Letter_ "). Pursuant to, and subject to the
terms and conditions of, the Commitment Letter, the lenders thereunder have
committed to provide to Parent the aggregate principal amounts set forth
therein (the provision of such funds

 



38  as set forth therein, the " _Financing_ ") for the purposes set forth in
such Commitment Letter. The Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated
or otherwise modified or waived prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, and the respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter
have not been withdrawn, rescinded, terminated, amended, restated or otherwise
modified in any respect prior to the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. There are no side letters or other Contracts or arrangements or
understandings to which Parent, Merger Sub or any of their Affiliates is a
party related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing (except
for the fee letter referenced above and any engagement letters or fee
discount letters related to the Financing, which will not have an adverse
impact on the funding of the full amount of the Financing pursuant to the
Commitment Letter at or prior to the Closing on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement and such Commitment Letter). As of the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect
and constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, and, to
the Knowledge of Parent, the other parties thereto, enforceable in accordance
with its terms against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the
other parties thereto, except as limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization or similar Laws affecting creditors rights generally and by
general principles of equity. There are no conditions precedent (including
pursuant to any "flex" provisions) related to the funding of the full amount
of the Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly
set forth in the Commitment Letter. Assuming the Financing is funded in
accordance with the Commitment Letter, and together with cash on hand at
Parent, the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, Parent and Merger Sub
will have at and after the Closing funds sufficient for the payment of the
aggregate cash portion of the Merger Consideration and any other amounts
required to be paid pursuant to Article II hereof, the funding of any
required refinancings or repayments of any existing Indebtedness of the
Company or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
the Merger and the payment of all fees and expenses required to be paid by
Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with this
Agreement and the Financing (the " _Required Amount_ "). As of the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, (i) no event has occurred which
would constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse
of time or both would constitute a default) or result in a failure to satisfy
a condition precedent, in each case, on the part of Parent or, to the
Knowledge of Parent, any other party to the Commitment Letter, under the
Commitment Letter, and (ii) Parent does not have any reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the
Financing will not be available to Parent on the Closing Date. Each of Parent
and Merger Sub, as applicable, has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any
and all commitment fees or other fees to the extent required to be paid on or
prior to the date of this Agreement in connection with the Financing.

Section 4.21. _Brokers_. Other than Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith
Incorporated, neither Parent nor Merger Sub has engaged any financial
advisor, broker or finder or incurred any liability for any financial advisory
fee, brokers fee, commission or finders fee in connection with any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 4.22. _Opinion of Financial Advisors_. The Parent Board has received
the opinion from Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, to the
effect that, subject to the assumptions, qualifications and other matters set
forth therein, as of the date thereof, the Merger Consideration to be paid by
Parent pursuant to this Agreement is fair, from a financial point of view, to
Parent.

 



39 Section 4.23. _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly contained in this Article IV, the
Company acknowledges that neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor any Person acting on
their behalf makes any other express or any implied representations or
warranties whatsoever and specifically (but without limiting the generality
of the foregoing) that neither Parent, Merger Sub, nor any Person acting on
their behalf makes any representation or warranty with respect to (i) Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, any of their businesses, operations, assets,

matter relating to Parent or the Parent Subsidiaries or (ii) any
documentation, forecasts, budgets, projections, estimates or other
information provided by Parent or any Person acting on its behalf to the

Section 5.3. _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, (i) Parent
and the Company shall jointly prepare and shall file with the SEC the joint
proxy statement to be sent to the stockholders of Parent relating to the
Parent Stockholders Meeting and to the stockholders of the Company relating to
the Company Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, together with
any amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Joint Proxy Statement_ ") and
(ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the
Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in connection with
the registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Common Stock to be
issued in the Merger. The respective Parties will cause the Joint Proxy
Statement and the Form S-4 to comply as to form in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing
(including by responding to comments of the SEC), to keep the Form S-4
effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby and Parent shall take all actions reasonably
required to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the Parent Stock Issuance. Each of Parent and the Company
shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. Each Party shall notify the
other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC

 



45  and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or
supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for additional
information and shall supply each other with copies of all correspondence
between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its
staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement, the Form
S-4 or the Merger. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond as promptly as practicable to any comments from the SEC or its staff
with respect to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 and to have any such
stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated. No filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and
no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be
made by Parent or the Company, in each case without providing the other Party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that
either such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the
Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties
hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information
shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the stockholders of Parent and the Company.

 

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the
Form S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Company
Stockholders Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , if on a date on which the
Company Stockholders Meeting is scheduled the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the
Company will have the right to make one or more successive postponements or
adjournments of the Company Stockholders Meeting, _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the Company Stockholders Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date
that is more than 30 days after the date for which the Company Stockholders
Meeting was originally scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements
that the Company reasonably determines are required by applicable Law).
Unless the Company Board has made a Company Recommendation Change, the Company
shall include the Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. As
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to mail the Joint Proxy
Statement to the holders of Company Common Stock and to solicit from such
stockholders proxies in respect of the adoption of this Agreement. Unless
this Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, the
obligation of the Company to call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting, to mail the Joint Proxy Statement to the holders
of Company Common Stock and to solicit from such stockholders proxies in
respect of the adoption of this Agreement, shall not be affected by a Company
Recommendation Change.

 

(c) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the Form
S-4, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders
Meeting; _provided_ , _however_ , if on a date on which the Parent
Stockholders Meeting is scheduled Parent has not received proxies representing
a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock to obtain the
Parent Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, Parent will
have the right

 



46  to make one or more successive postponements or adjournments of the Parent
Stockholders Meeting, _provided_ _further_ , that the Parent Stockholders
Meeting is not postponed or adjourned to a date that is more than 30 days
after the date for which the Parent Stockholders Meeting was originally
scheduled (excluding any adjournments or postponements that Parent reasonably
determines are required by applicable Law). Unless the Parent Board has made
a Parent Recommendation Change, Parent shall include such Parent
Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable after
the Form S-4 shall have become effective, Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to mail the Joint Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common
Stock and to solicit from such stockholders proxies in favor of the approval
of the Parent Stock Issuance. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
in accordance with Section 7.1, the obligation of Parent to call, give notice
of, convene and hold the Parent Stockholders Meeting, to mail the Joint Proxy
Statement to the holders of Parent Company Stock and to solicit from such
stockholders proxies in respect of the Parent Stock Issuance, shall not be
affected by a Parent Recommendation Change.

(d) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting
on the same date.

(e) Immediately following execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
Parties, Parent shall adopt this Agreement as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub and, promptly thereafter, deliver to the Company a copy of the written
consent reflecting the adoption of this Agreement by Parent as the sole
stockholder of Merger Sub.

Section 5.4. _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) The Company will and will cause the Company Subsidiaries to (i)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Person or its Representatives (other than
Parent and Merger Sub and their Representatives) conducted prior to the date
of this Agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information
previously furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic
data room access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives
and (iii) promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective
Representatives of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.4. The Company
shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive,
amend or modify any provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality
agreement to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such
agreement; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company may grant a waiver of,
and shall not be obligated to enforce, any such provision (y) to the extent
required to permit a party to submit a Company Acquisition Proposal and (z) if
the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, that the failure to grant such waiver could reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly permitted in accordance with Section 5.4(c)
or Section 5.4(e), neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary will, and
the Company will direct its and their respective Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any
inquiry or the making or announcement of 

 



47  any proposal or offer that constitutes a Company Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate or engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to
any Person any information or data with respect to, or otherwise cooperate
with or knowingly take any other action to facilitate any proposal that
constitutes a Company Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle or Contract relating to or providing for a
Company Acquisition Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred
to in Section 5.4(c)).

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.4(b) or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time before the Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, the
Company may (and the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives at the request of the Company may), in response to an
unsolicited written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a
material breach of Section 5.4(a) or (b), (x) contact any Person or its
Representatives who has made such a Company Acquisition Proposal solely for
the purpose of clarifying such Company Acquisition Proposal and the terms
thereof, (y) furnish information and data to the Person making such Company
Acquisition Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance
with a written confidentiality agreement, containing provisions relating to
confidentiality that are no less restrictive in the aggregate than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that
such confidentiality agreement need not contain "standstill" provisions), or
(z) participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or
its Representatives regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal (and, if
applicable in connection therewith, waive or otherwise modify any
"standstill" or similar agreement); _provided_ that prior to taking any action
described in clauses (y) or (z), the Company Board has determined in good
faith, (i) after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Company Proposal and (ii) after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties
under applicable Law. No confidentiality agreement entered into pursuant to
this Section 5.4(c) may contain any provision that would prevent the Company
from complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to Parent
required pursuant to this Section 5.4. Any non-public information concerning
the Company provided by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Person
entering into a confidentiality agreement pursuant to this Section 5.4(c) that
has not been previously provided to Parent must be provided by the Company to
Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to
such Person.

(d) Promptly after the receipt by the Company of any Company Acquisition
Proposal after the date of this Agreement, and in any case within 48 hours
after receipt thereof by an executive officer of the Company, the Company will
notify Parent of any such Company Acquisition Proposal and the material terms
and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal, including the identity
of the Person making any such Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company will,
in person or by telephone, keep Parent reasonably informed and on a reasonably
current basis of the status (including with respect to any change in price
or other material amendment thereto) of such Company Acquisition Proposal.
The Company will, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide Parent
(and its outside counsel) with copies of all drafts and final versions of
definitive or other agreements including schedules and exhibits thereto
(which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential
information of the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal) relating
to such Company Acquisition Proposal, in each case exchanged between the
Company or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making
such Company Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other
hand.

 



48 (e) Except as provided in this Section 5.4(e), neither the Company Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify (or propose
publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Recommendation or (ii) authorize, approve or recommend (or publicly
propose to authorize, approve or recommend) any Company Acquisition Proposal
(any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), a " _Company
Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if
and only if the Company Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Company Board may (x) effect a Company Recommendation
Change (A) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good faith
constitutes a Superior Company Proposal or (B) other than in response to a
Company Acquisition Proposal and/or (y) terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c)(iii) following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written
Company Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined in good
faith constitutes a Superior Company Proposal. Prior to the Company effecting
a Company Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant
to Section 7.1(c)(iii), (i) the Company shall provide Parent with written
notice advising Parent it intends to effect a Company Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii), as applicable,
and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and (ii) during
the five (5) Business Day period commencing on the Business Day following the
date of such notice (the " _Company Negotiation Period_ "), if requested
by Parent, the Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to
amend the terms of this Agreement (1) in the case of a proposed Company
Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (x)(A) of the second sentence of
this Section 5.4(e) and/or a proposed termination of this Agreement
contemplated in clause (y) of such sentence, such that the Company Acquisition
Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Company Proposal or (2) in the
case of a proposed Company Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (x)(B) of
the second sentence of this Section 5.4(e), in a manner that obviates the need
to effect such Company Recommendation Change. If, based on changes to this
Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent by 11:59 p.m., New York
City time, on the last Business Day of the applicable Company Negotiation
Period, the Company Board determines that it may no longer effect a Company
Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement in compliance with the
second sentence of this Section 5.4(e), the Company shall not effect such
Company Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement. A subsequent
amendment to the amount or form of consideration payable in connection with
the original Company Acquisition Proposal shall require the Company to comply
again with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.4(e) one additional time
prior to effecting any Company Recommendation Change or terminating this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iii); _provided_ , _however_ , that in
connection with the second Company Negotiation Period, if any, references to
five (5) Business Days above shall be deemed to be references to three (3)
Business Days instead. In no event will there be more than two (2) Company
Negotiation Periods and the Company will not be required to deliver more than
two (2) such notices pursuant to this Section 5.4(e) or to comply with any of
the other provisions of the last three sentences of this Section 5.4(e) that
would have otherwise been applicable had the Company delivered additional
notices.

 



49 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in Section 5.3 or this Section 5.4 will prohibit the Company or the
Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, including
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A (or any similar
communication to stockholders) or (ii) making a "stop, look and listen" or
similar communication to stockholders of the type contemplated by Rule
14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to recommend that the
stockholders of the Company tender any securities in connection with any
tender or exchange offer (or otherwise authorize, approve or recommend any
Company Acquisition Proposal) or withhold, withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation, except as permitted by Section 5.4(e).

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Company Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons (other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiary)
relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business that
constitutes 15% or more of the net sales, operating income or total assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (excluding, in
each case, net sales, operating income or assets from discontinued
operations), or 15% or more of the total voting power of the equity Securities
of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated
would result in any Person or group of Persons Beneficially Owning 15% or
more of the total voting power of the equity Securities of the Company, or any
merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
the Company (or any Company Subsidiary or Company Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the net sales, operating income or total assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (excluding, in
each case, net sales, operating income or assets from discontinued
operations)), or any combination of the foregoing; _provided_ that the term
"Company Acquisition Proposal" will not include the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Company
Acquisition Proposal (except that references therein to "15%" shall be
replaced by "50%") made by any Person or group of Persons (other than Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary), which in the good faith judgment of the Company
Board (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial
advisors) would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more
favorable from a financial point of view to the stockholders of the Company
than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement after taking into account
the likelihood and timing of consummation (as compared to the transactions
contemplated hereby) and such other matters that the Company Board
considers relevant, including legal, financial (including the financing terms
of any such Company Acquisition Proposal), regulatory and other aspects of
such Company Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such
Company Acquisition Proposal. 

 



50 Section 5.5. _No Solicitation by Parent_.

 

(a) Parent will and will cause the Parent Subsidiaries to (i) immediately
cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Person or its Representatives (other than the Company
and Merger Sub and their Representatives) conducted prior to the date of this
Agreement with respect to any Parent Acquisition Proposal, (ii) request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished and immediately terminate all physical and electronic data room
access previously granted to any such Person or its Representatives and (iii)
promptly inform its and its Subsidiaries respective Representatives of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 5.5. Parent shall not, and shall cause
each of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any
provision of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and Parent shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may grant a waiver of, and shall not be obligated to
enforce, any such provision (y) to the extent required to permit a party to
submit a Parent Acquisition Proposal and (z) if the Parent Board has
determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that
the failure to grant such waiver could reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(b) Except as otherwise expressly permitted in accordance with Section 5.5(c)
or Section 5.5(e), neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary will, and Parent
will direct its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly (i) solicit or knowingly facilitate or encourage any inquiry or the
making or announcement of any proposal or offer that constitutes a Parent
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate or engage in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information or data with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate with or knowingly take any other action to
facilitate any proposal that constitutes a Parent Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle or Contract
relating to or providing for a Parent Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 5.5(c)).

(c) Notwithstanding Section 5.5(b) or anything else in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time before the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained,
Parent may (and the Parent Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives at the request of Parent may), in response to an unsolicited
written Parent Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a material
breach of Section 5.5(a) or (b), (x) contact any Person or its Representatives
who has made such a Parent Acquisition Proposal solely for the purpose of
clarifying such Parent Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof, (y)
furnish information and data to the Person making such Parent Acquisition
Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a written
confidentiality agreement, containing provisions relating to
confidentiality that are no less restrictive in the aggregate than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that such
confidentiality agreement need not contain "standstill" provisions), or (z)
participate or engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its
Representatives regarding such Parent Acquisition Proposal (and, if applicable
in connection therewith, waive or otherwise modify any "standstill" or similar
agreement); _provided_  that prior to taking any action described in clauses
(y) or (z), the Parent Board has determined in good faith, (i) after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such
Parent Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
result in a Superior Parent Proposal and

 



51  (ii) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take
such action could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law. No confidentiality agreement entered into
pursuant to this Section 5.5(c) may contain any provision that would prevent
Parent from complying with its obligation to provide any disclosure to the
Company required pursuant to this Section 5.5. Any non-public information
concerning Parent provided by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to any Person
entering into a confidentiality agreement pursuant to this Section 5.5(c) that
has not been previously provided to the Company must be provided by Parent to
the Company prior to or substantially concurrently with the time it is
provided to such Person.

(d) Promptly after the receipt by Parent of any Parent Acquisition Proposal
after the date of this Agreement, and in any case within 48 hours after
receipt thereof by an executive officer of Parent, Parent will notify the
Company of any such Parent Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Parent Acquisition Proposal, including the identity of the
Person making any such Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent will, in person or
by telephone, keep the Company reasonably informed and on a reasonably
current basis of the status (including with respect to any change in price or
other material amendment thereto) of such Parent Acquisition Proposal. Parent
will, promptly upon receipt or delivery thereof, provide the Company (and
its outside counsel) with copies of all drafts and final versions of
definitive or other agreements including schedules and exhibits thereto (which
may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect confidential information of
the Person making such Parent Acquisition Proposal) relating to such Parent
Acquisition Proposal, in each case exchanged between Parent or any of its
Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making such Parent
Acquisition Proposal or any of its Representatives, on the other hand.

(e) Except as provided in this Section 5.5(e), neither the Parent Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify (or propose
publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to the Company,
the Parent Recommendation or (ii) authorize, approve or recommend (or publicly
propose to authorize, approve or recommend) any Parent Acquisition Proposal
(any of the actions described in clauses (i) or (ii), a " _Parent
Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, if
and only if the Parent Board has determined in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action could
reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, the Parent Board may effect a Parent Recommendation Change (A)
following receipt of an unsolicited bona fide written Parent Acquisition
Proposal that the Parent Board has determined in good faith constitutes
a Superior Parent Proposal or (B) other than in response to a Company
Acquisition Proposal. Prior to Parent effecting a Parent Recommendation
Change, (i) Parent shall provide the Company with written notice advising the
Company it intends to effect a Parent Recommendation Change and specifying,
in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor and (ii) during the five (5)
Business Day period commencing on the Business Day following the date of such
notice (the " _Parent Negotiation Period_ "), if requested by the Company,
Parent shall engage in good faith negotiations with the Company to amend the
terms of this Agreement (1) in the case of a proposed Parent Recommendation
Change pursuant to clause (A) of the second sentence of this Section 5.5(e),
such that the Parent Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Parent Proposal or (2) in the case of a proposed Parent
Recommendation Change pursuant to clause (B) of the second sentence of this
Section 5.5(e),

 



52  in a manner that obviates the need to effect such Parent Recommendation
Change. If, based on changes to this Agreement that may be offered in writing
by the Company by 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of
the applicable Parent Negotiation Period, the Parent Board determines that it
may no longer effect a Parent Recommendation Change in compliance with the
second sentence of this Section 5.5(e), Parent shall not effect such Parent
Recommendation Change. A subsequent amendment to the amount or form of
consideration payable in connection with the original Parent Acquisition
Proposal shall require Parent to comply again with the procedures set forth in
this Section 5.5(e) one additional time prior to effecting any Parent
Recommendation Change; _provided_ , _however_ , that in connection with the
second Parent Negotiation Period, if any, references to five (5) Business Days
above shall be deemed to be references to three (3) Business Days instead. In
no event will there be more than two (2) Parent Negotiation Periods and Parent
will not be required to deliver more than two (2) such notices pursuant to
this Section 5.5(e) or to comply with any of the other provisions of the last
three sentences of this Section 5.5(e) that would have otherwise been
applicable had Parent delivered additional notices.

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing
contained in Section 5.3 or this Section 5.5 will prohibit Parent or the
Parent Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with respect to a Parent Acquisition Proposal, including taking
and disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position contemplated by
Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act or making a statement
contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A (or any similar communication
to stockholders) or (ii) making a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication to stockholders of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Parent
Board shall be permitted to recommend that the stockholders of Parent tender
any securities in connection with any tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
authorize, approve or recommend any Parent Acquisition Proposal) or withhold,
withdraw or modify the Parent Recommendation, except as permitted by Section
5.5(e).

 

(g) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Parent Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer from any
Person or group of Persons relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of a business that constitutes 15% or more of the net sales,
operating profits or assets of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, or 15% or more of the total voting power of the equity Securities of
Parent, any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result in
any Person or group of Persons Beneficially Owning 15% or more of the total
voting power of the equity Securities of Parent, or any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction involving
Parent (or any Parent Subsidiary or Parent Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the net sales, operating profits or assets of
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or any combination of
the foregoing; _provided_ that the term "Parent Acquisition Proposal" will not
include the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(ii) " _Superior Parent Proposal_ " means any bona fide written
Parent Acquisition Proposal (except that references therein to "15%" shall be
replaced by

 



53  "50%") made by any Person or group of Persons (other than the Company or any
Company Subsidiary), which in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board
(after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors)
would result, if consummated, in a transaction that is more favorable from a
financial point of view to the stockholders of Parent than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement after taking into account the likelihood and
timing of consummation (as compared to the transactions contemplated hereby)
and such other matters that the Parent Board considers relevant, including
legal, financial (including the financing terms of any such
Parent Acquisition Proposal), regulatory and other aspects of such Parent
Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Parent
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Section 5.6. _Publicity_. Except with respect to, or following, any Company
Recommendation Change or Parent Recommendation Change made in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement, and except to the extent disclosed in or
consistent with the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 in accordance with
Section 5.3, Parent and the Company shall consult with each other
before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review any press
release or other public statements with respect to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as such Party may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law
or the rules of the NYSE (or any other securities market).

 

Section 5.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company shall
each give prompt notice to the other Party if any of the following occur
after the date of this Agreement: (i) receipt of any written notice to the
receiving Party from any third Person alleging that the consent or approval of
such third Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such consent could (in
the good faith determination of such Party) reasonably be expected to prevent
or materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) receipt of any notice or
other communication from any Governmental Entity or the NYSE (or any other
securities market) in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or (iii) the occurrence of an event which
would or would be reasonably likely to (A) prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
(B) result in the failure of any condition to the Merger set forth in Article
VI to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice
pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
of the Company or Parent available hereunder and no information delivered
pursuant to this Section 5.7 shall update any section of the Company
Disclosure Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter or shall affect the
representations or warranties of the Parties hereunder and the failure to
comply with this Section 5.7 will not constitute the breach or noncompliance
of a covenant by such Party for determining the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Section 6.2(b) or Section 6.3(b).

 

Section 5.8. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each Party shall afford to the other Party and its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives, during normal business hours
during the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of the
Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement, 

 



54  reasonable access to all its and its Subsidiaries properties, books,
contracts, commitments and records, and to its and its Subsidiaries officers,
employees, accountants, counsel and other Representatives and, during such
period, each Party shall promptly make available to the other Party (i) a copy
of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed or
received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal
securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as the other Party may reasonably request.

 

(b) No investigation by any of the Parties or their respective Representatives
shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of any
other Party set forth herein.

(c) This Section 5.8 shall not require any Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of
such Party is competitively sensitive, would reasonably be expected to result
in any violation of any material Contract or Law to which such Party is a
party or is subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client
privilege) which such Party or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to
assert to be undermined with respect to such information (subject to
reasonable cooperation between the Parties with respect to entering into
appropriate joint defense, community of interest or similar agreements or
arrangements with respect to the preservation of such privileges); _provided_
, that the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to
allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (i) would not (in
the good faith belief of the disclosing Party) reasonably be likely to result
in the violation of any such material Contract or Law or reasonably be likely
to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or
(ii) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the disclosing Party) be
managed through the use of any "clean-room" arrangements agreed between the
Parties pursuant to which non-employee Representatives of the non-disclosing
Party shall be provided access to such information; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that the disclosing Party shall notify the other Party that such disclosures
are reasonably likely to violate the disclosing Partys or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any such material Contract or Law or are reasonably likely
to cause such privilege to be undermined.

 

(d) Unless and until the Closing occurs, the information provided by each
Party pursuant to this Section 5.8 shall be kept confidential by the
recipient thereof in accordance with, and shall otherwise abide by and be
subject to the terms and conditions of, the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Party agrees
that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, prior to the
Effective Time, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.8 for
any competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the Merger.

 

Section 5.9. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements
which may be imposed on such Party or its Subsidiaries 

 



55  with respect to the Merger and, subject to the conditions set forth in
Article VI hereof, to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, as promptly as practicable and (ii) to obtain
(and to cooperate with the other Party to obtain) any consent, authorization,
order, decision or approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity
and any other third Person which is required to be obtained by Parent or the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the
terms and conditions of any such consent, authorization, order or approval.
To the extent necessary in order to accomplish the foregoing and subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 5.9(e), Parent and the Company shall use
their respective reasonable best efforts to jointly propose, negotiate,
commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise,
the sale, divestiture or disposition of, or prohibition or limitation on the
ownership or operation by Parent and the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries of, any portion of the business, properties or assets of Parent,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective, as soon as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, including using
reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind any decision, injunction or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
Parties to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and using
reasonable best efforts to defend any litigation seeking to enjoin, prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or seeking
material damages.

 

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each Party
hereto shall make or cause to be made an appropriate filing pursuant to the
HSR Act and the applicable Competition Laws of the countries and jurisdictions
listed in Section 5.9 of the Parent Disclosure Letter with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable, and to supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act and the Competition Laws of the
countries and jurisdictions listed in Section 5.9 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
other actions consistent with this Section 5.9 necessary to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods, or the receipt of
any decision, order or consent, as the case may be, under the HSR Act
(including any extensions thereof) or any applicable Competition Laws of the
countries and jurisdictions listed in Section 5.9 of the Parent Disclosure
Letter as soon as practicable and (ii) each of the Parent and the Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all action reasonably
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (y) if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, take all action reasonable
to enable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated
as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(d) Each of the Parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing,
submission or

 



56  proceeding with a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any governmental inquiry,
investigation or proceeding initiated by a private party, including producing
any documents or information reasonably requested by the other Party or
Governmental Entity, and (ii) keep the other Party informed in all material
respects and on a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by
such Party from, or given by such Party to, the FTC, the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entity and of any
communication received or given by a private Person in connection with any
governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding, including any inquiry or
proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of this
Section 5.9(d), subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, each Party shall consult and cooperate with the other Party in
connection with any analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief,
argument, opinion or proposal made or submitted in connection with any such
request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding. In
addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity or by Law, in
connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other
legal proceeding, each Party hereto shall permit the authorized
Representatives of the other Party (x) to participate at or in each
substantive meeting, conference, telephone call or other communication with a
representative of a Governmental Entity or private party, as the case may be,
relating to such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal
proceeding and (y) to have reasonable access to and be consulted in connection
with any material document, opinion or proposal made or submitted to any
Governmental Entity or private party, as the case may be, in connection with
any such request, inquiry, investigation, action or other legal proceeding.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing and the obligations set forth in Sections
5.9(a)-(d), neither Parent nor the Company shall be required pursuant to
Section 5.9(a)-(d) to propose, commit to or effect any action that is not
conditioned on the consummation of the Merger or that would reasonably be
expected (after giving effect to any reasonably expected proceeds of any
divestiture, sale of assets or other action required to satisfy the conditions
in Section 6.1(e)) to have a material adverse effect on the business
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

Section 5.10. _Indemnification_.

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will, and
Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, all past and
present directors, officers and employees of the Company and any Company
Subsidiary and all fiduciaries under any Company Benefit Plans (each,
together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a " _Company
Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs, expenses (including attorneys fees
and expenses and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any Proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer,
employee or fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or a
fiduciary under any Company Benefit Plan or is or was serving at the request
of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a director, officer or
employee of any other corporation, limited liability company,

 



57  partnership, joint venture, trust or other business or non-profit enterprise
(including any employee benefit plan) whether asserted or claimed prior to, at
or after the Effective Time (including with respect to the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), and provide advancement of
expenses to the Company Indemnified Parties (within ten (10) days of receipt
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation from a Company Indemnified Party of a
request therefor) and (ii) not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of
any judgment in any Proceeding (in which indemnification could be sought by a
Company Indemnified Party hereunder), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of such Company Indemnified Party
from all liability arising out of such Proceeding or such Company Indemnified
Party otherwise consents in writing.

 

(b) In addition to the obligations set forth in Section 5.10(a), from and
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
honor and maintain in effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time
(i) all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of
each Company Indemnified Party as provided in their respective Constituent
Documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement and (ii) all rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses of each Company Indemnified
Party as provided in any indemnification or other agreement, to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party. Parent further agrees that it
shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries not
to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any of the foregoing provisions in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Company
Indemnified Parties and that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding pending or asserted or
any claim made within such period shall continue until the final disposition
of such Proceeding.

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation will maintain, and Parent will cause to be maintained, in effect
the coverage provided by the policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect as of the Effective
Time by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries from a carrier with the same
or better credit ratings to the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy carrier and with terms,
conditions, retentions and levels of coverage not less favorable to the
insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts, events, acts or omissions that
occurred on or before the Effective Time, _except_ that in no event will
Parent be required to pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of
300% of the Companys current annual premium for its policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the Effective Time (the " _Premium Cap_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that if such insurance can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of
the Premium Cap, Parent will obtain the policy of directors and officers
insurance with the best overall terms, conditions, retentions and levels of
coverage available for an annual premium equal to the Premium Cap. In lieu of
the foregoing, the Company may in its discretion purchase, and Parent may in
its discretion purchase if the Company declines to do so, a "tail" directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy
covering the six-year period from and after the Effective Time from a carrier
with the same or better credit ratings to the Companys existing directors
and officers insurance and fiduciary liability insurance policy carrier and
with terms, conditions, retentions

 



58  and levels of coverage not less favorable to the insured Persons than the
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
coverage currently maintained by the Company with respect to claims arising
from facts, events, acts or omissions that occurred on or before the Effective
Time.

(d) In the event that either Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties, rights and other assets to any Person, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause
proper provision to be made so that such successor or assign shall expressly
assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.10.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.10 shall survive consummation of the
Merger, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each indemnified or insured party (including the Company Indemnified Parties),
his or her heirs, executors and administrators and his or her representatives
and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification, advancement or contribution that any such Person may have by
Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

Section 5.11. _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub will use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the proceeds of the
Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and
effect the Commitment Letter, (ii) negotiate definitive financing agreements
with respect to the Financing on terms and conditions that are not materially
less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms and conditions
contemplated by the Commitment Letter and enter into, on or prior to the
Closing Date, definitive financing agreements with respect to the Financing,
and promptly upon execution thereof provide executed copies of such definitive
agreements to the Company, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis (or obtain the
waiver of) (taking into account the expected timing of the Closing) all
conditions and covenants, and otherwise comply with all terms and conditions,
applicable to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letter and
such definitive agreements within their control, (iv) consummate the
Financing at or prior to Closing, and (v) enforce their rights under the
Commitment Letter. In the event that all conditions to the Commitment Letter
have been satisfied or, upon funding will be satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Financing Sources and the
other Persons providing or committing to provide the Financing to comply with
their obligations under the Commitment Letter and the definitive financing
agreements entered into in connection with the Financing and to fund on or
before the Closing Date the Financing required to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including taking
enforcement action, to cause the Financing Sources and the other Persons
providing or committing to provide the Financing to fund such Financing).
Parent and Merger Sub will keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis of the status of their efforts to arrange the Financing and to satisfy
the conditions thereof, including (A) promptly notifying the Company of (1)
any actual, threatened or alleged material breach or default by any party to
the Commitment 

 



59  Letter or any definitive financing agreement entered into in connection with
the Financing, if such breach or default would reasonably be expected to
affect the timely availability of, or the amount of, the Financing and (2)
the receipt by any of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
Representatives of any notice or other communication from any Financing Source
or any other Person with respect to any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any Commitment Letter or any definitive
financing agreement entered into in connection with the Financing, if such
dispute or disagreement would reasonably be expected to affect the timely
availability of, or amount of, the Financing, and (B) upon the Companys
reasonable request, advising and updating the Company, in a reasonable level
of detail, with respect to the status (and any material developments
concerning such status) and proposed funding date thereunder. Without the
prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub will not agree,
permit, or otherwise consent, to any amendment of, supplement or modification
to, or waiver under, the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing if such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver (x) would reduce the aggregate cash amount of proceeds of the Financing
(including by changing the amount of fees to be paid or original
issue discount of the Financing), (y) would change or impose new or
additional conditions or otherwise expands or amends any of the conditions to
the receipt of the Financing from those set forth in the Commitment Letter on
the date of this Agreement or (z) would otherwise reasonably be expected to
(1) prevent or materially delay the Closing Date or (2) make the timely
funding of the Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Financing less likely to occur, (collectively, the " _Restricted Commitment
Letter Amendments_ "), other than a waiver of any closing conditions by
lender(s) or their agents. Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Commitment
Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or
similar entities that have not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date
of this Agreement, if the addition of such additional parties, individually or
in the aggregate, would not result in the occurrence of a Restricted
Commitment Letter Amendment. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub shall not
permit or consent to any waiver of any remedy under the Commitment Letter or
to any early termination of the Commitment Letter. For purposes of this
Agreement, references to the "Commitment Letter" shall include such documents
as permitted or required by this Section 5.11 to be amended, modified,
supplemented or waived, in each case from and after the date of such
amendment, supplement, modification or waiver.

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of reasonable best efforts by Parent and
Merger Sub to satisfy their obligations under this Section 5.11, any of the
Financing or the Commitment Letter (or any definitive financing agreement
relating thereto) expire or are terminated or otherwise become unavailable
prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason, Parent and Merger
Sub will (i) promptly notify the Company of such expiration, termination or
unavailability and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts promptly to arrange
for alternative financing (which will be in an amount sufficient to pay, when
added to the other resources of Parent and other financing arrangements, the
Required Amount) from other sources on terms and conditions not materially
less favorable, taken as a whole, to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms
and conditions of the Financing contained in the Commitment Letter to replace
the Financing contemplated by such expired or terminated or unavailable
commitments or agreements (" _Alternative Financing_ "). Copies of each
commitment letter and other agreement relating to the Alternative Financing
(the " _Alternative Commitment Letters_ ") shall be promptly provided to the
Company (except for customary engagement letters and fee letters, redacted
copies of which fee letters will be delivered). If applicable, references in
this Agreement to

 



60  "Financing" shall include "Alternative Financing," any reference to the
"Commitment Letter" shall include the "Alternative Commitment Letters" and
any reference to definitive financing agreements related to the Financing
shall include the definitive financing agreements related to the Alternative
Financing.

 

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing is not a condition to the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Financing has not been obtained, Parent and Merger Sub shall continue to
be obligated, prior to any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
7.1 and subject to the fulfillment or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article VI, to complete the Merger and consummate the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

(d) Prior to the Closing, the Company will, and will use reasonable best
efforts to cause the Company Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably requested by
Parent in connection with the arrangement, marketing and consummation of the
Financing ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such requested cooperation does not
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries), including using reasonable best efforts to: (i)
deliver to Parent financial and other pertinent information regarding the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by Parent
and that is customarily required for financings of the type contemplated by
the Commitment Letter, including (A) the financial statements referred to in
paragraph (vii) of Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter and (B) such information
as to enable Parent to prepare the pro forma financial statements referred to
in paragraph (ix) of Exhibit D to the Commitment Letter, in each case,
consistent with the Companys past practices for preparing such information;
(ii) to the extent customarily required for financings of the type
contemplated by the Commitment Letter, make appropriate officers available to
participate in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations, road shows, due
diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies; (iii) provide reasonable
assistance to Parent in the preparation of customary offering documents,
including confidential information memoranda, prospectuses, private placement
memoranda, offering memoranda and bank confidential information memoranda and
road show materials, rating agency materials and other similar documents
necessary in connection with the Financing and providing reasonable and
customary representations and authorization letters related thereto; (iv) if
reasonably requested in writing by a Financing Source, furnish to
such Financing Source all information regarding the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries that is required in connection with the Financing by U.S.
regulatory authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money
laundering rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act; (v) assist
Parent in obtaining corporate, corporate family, credit, facility and
securities ratings from rating agencies; (vi) assist Parent in obtaining (A)
customary consents (including consents with respect to inclusion of the
Companys financial statements and any audit opinions in respect thereof in
any prospectus or offering memorandum or similar documents for any portion of
the Financing) and (B) customary comfort letters of the Companys independent
accountants (including "negative assurance" comfort), including by executing
and delivering any customary representation letters to the accountants in
connection therewith; (vii) cooperate with Parents and Merger Subs legal
counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such legal counsel may be
required to obtain in connection with the Financing; and (viii) execute
customary certificates as may be reasonably requested by Parent as necessary
in connection with the Financing ( _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) any such
certificates will be not

 



61  be executed except in connection with the closing of any Financing and (B)
no personal liability will be imposed on the officers or employees involved).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective Representatives
(1) to take any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict with or
violate the Companys or any of the Company Subsidiaries Constituent
Documents or any Law or result in the breach of any material Contract or (2)
to pay any commitment or similar fee, reimburse any expenses, provide any
indemnities or incur or assume any liability or obligation. Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all out-of-
pocket costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or
the Company Subsidiaries in performing their obligations under this Section
5.11(d), and indemnify the Company for any and all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
arising therefrom. None of the representations, warranties or covenants of
the Company set forth in this Agreement shall be deemed to apply to, or deemed
breached or violated by, any of the actions taken by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary at the request of Parent set forth in this Section
5.11(d).

(e) _Consent Solicitations_.

 

(i) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to commence, on the date
designated by Parent after the effectiveness of the Form S-4 on at least five
Business Days notice to the Company, a consent solicitation with respect to
the Company Notes (the " _Consent Solicitation_ ") for the purposes of
obtaining the consents, amendments and waivers from holders of the Company
Notes set forth on Section 5.11(e) of the Parent Disclosure Letter on
customary terms and conditions reasonably acceptable to Parent and the
Company. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain
the requisite consents from holders of the Company Notes to effect such
consents, amendments or waivers; _provided_ that (x) the Company shall have
received from Parent the completed Consent Solicitation Documents (as defined
below) which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company and (y) at the
time of such commencement, Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or
complied in all material respects with all of their agreements and covenants
required by this Agreement to be performed on or prior to the time that the
Consent Solicitation is to be commenced. The Company shall waive any of the
conditions to the Consent Solicitation (other than that there shall be no
order prohibiting consummation of the Consent Solicitation) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent in writing and shall not, without the consent
of Parent, waive any condition to the Consent Solicitation or make any changes
to the terms and conditions of the Consent Solicitation other than as agreed
between Parent and the Company.

(ii) The Company shall retain the financial institution reasonably requested
by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as sole
solicitation agent in connection with the Consent Solicitation. The Company
shall execute a customary solicitation agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Company, with such financial
institution and shall use its reasonable best efforts to provide the
solicitation agent with (or assist the solicitation agent in obtaining) a list
of holders of the Company Notes, customary legal opinions as may be
reasonably requested by the solicitation agent and any other customary
documents reasonably required by the solicitation agent in connection with the
Consent Solicitation.

 



62 (iii) The Company covenants and agrees that, promptly following the
expiration of the Consent Solicitation, assuming the requisite consents under
the Company Notes Indenture are received, the Company shall execute
supplemental indentures to the Company Notes Indenture, which supplemental
indentures shall implement the consents, amendments or waivers set forth in
the Consent Solicitation Documents and shall become operative upon the
conditions thereto being satisfied or waived and on or after the Effective
Time, and shall execute customary closing certificates and other similar
documents as may be reasonably requested by the trustee for the Company Notes
in connection with the execution of any supplemental indenture. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain customary legal opinions as
may be reasonably requested by the trustee for the Company Notes in
connection with the execution of any supplemental indenture. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge and agree that the consummation of the Consent Solicitation is
not a condition to Closing. 

(iv) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent, at its own expense, shall prepare all necessary and appropriate
documentation in connection with the solicitation of holders of Company Notes
pursuant to the Consent Solicitation, including the consent solicitation
statement, related letters of transmittal and other related documents
(collectively, the " _Consent Solicitation Documents_ "). Parent and the
Company shall reasonably cooperate with each other in the preparation of the
Consent Solicitation Documents. All documents distributed to the holders
of the Company Notes in connection with the Consent Solicitation shall be
subject to prior review and comment by the Company and Parent and shall be
reasonably acceptable to each of them. If at any time prior to the completion
of the Consent Solicitation any information in the Consent Solicitation
Documents should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Consent Solicitation Documents, so
that the Consent Solicitation Documents shall not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party, and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
disseminated to the holders of the Company Notes.

 

(v) Parent shall pay any consideration payable to the holders of the Company
Notes and all fees and expenses of any solicitation agent, information agent,
depositary or other agent retained in connection with the Consent Solicitation
(or if paid by Company, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company), and
Parent further agrees to reimburse the Company for all of its reasonable out-
of-pocket costs in connection with the Consent Solicitation promptly following
incurrence and delivery of reasonable documentation of such costs. Parent and
Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless
the Company, the Company Subsidiaries, and its and their officers, directors
and Representatives and each person, if any, who controls the

 



63  Company within the meaning of Section 20 of the Exchange Act for and against
any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with the Consent Solicitation and the Consent Solicitation Documents;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any
obligation to indemnify and hold harmless any such party or person to the
extent that any such liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses,
interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred arises from
disclosure regarding the Company supplied by the Company or in the
Company SEC Document that is determined in a final, non-appealable Order of a
court of competent jurisdiction, to have contained a material misstatement or
omission.

 

Section 5.12. _Employee Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on the earlier
of (x) the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (y) December 31, 2015,
the Surviving Corporation will provide each employee of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (other than employees whose terms and conditions of employment
are governed by a collective bargaining agreement) who remains in the active
employment of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries (the "
_Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) aggregate cash compensation that is
substantially comparable as to each Continuing Employees aggregate annual
rate of salary or wages and target bonus opportunity provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, and (ii) employee
benefits (other than equity-based awards and benefits pursuant to a
defined benefit plan) that are either (A) substantially comparable, in the
aggregate, to the employee benefits (other than equity-based awards and
benefits pursuant to a defined benefit plan) provided by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement or (B) substantially
similar to the employee benefits (other than equity-based awards and benefits
pursuant to a defined benefit plan) provided to similarly-situated employees
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor all obligations under
the compensation, retention and severance arrangements and agreements set
forth in Section 5.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, and collective
bargaining agreements, in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time. Subject to Section 409A of the Code, Parent and
the Company hereby agree that a "change of control" or "change in control"
within the meaning of each Company Benefit Plan (or an event of similar effect
under the terms of such Company Benefit Plan) will occur upon the Closing.

(c) Bonus Plans

 

(i) All fiscal year 2014 bonus amounts under annual bonus, sales and other
cash incentive plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _FY2014
Bonuses_ ") will be calculated and paid in the ordinary course of business to
the eligible employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that (I) if the Closing Date
occurs on the last day of, or following the end of, fiscal year 2014, such
bonus amounts shall be calculated based on actual results and performance
achieved in respect of fiscal year 2014, or (II) if the Closing Date occurs
prior to the end of fiscal year 2014, such bonus amounts shall be

 



64  calculated based on target level of performance in respect of fiscal year
2014, and in the case of either (I) or (II), such bonus amounts shall be paid
in the ordinary course of business but no later than March 15, 2015 (and
without regard to whether such employee is employed on the relevant payment
date).

 

(ii) To the extent that the Closing Date occurs in fiscal year 2015,
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Companys annual
cash incentive plan (the " _Bonus Plan_ "), with the fiscal year 2015 targets
and budget under the Bonus Plan to be set in consultation with Parent;
_provided_ that the aggregate amount of the payments to be made under the
Bonus Plan in respect of fiscal year 2015 assuming achievement of target
performance levels shall in no event be greater than 110% of the aggregate
amount of the payments to be made under the plan in respect of fiscal year
2014 at target performance levels; _provided_ , _further_ , that a Continuing
Employee must be employed on the applicable payment date in 2016 in order to
receive a bonus payment under the Bonus Plan in respect of fiscal year 2015.

 

(d) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its and any of its Subsidiaries third party insurance
providers or third party administrators to waive all limitations as to any
pre-existing condition or waiting periods in its applicable welfare plans with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to each
Continuing Employee under any welfare plans that such employees may be
eligible to participate in after the Effective Time, other than limitations or
waiting periods that are already in effect with respect to such employees and
that have not been satisfied as of the Effective Time under any comparable
employee benefit plan. In addition, as of the Effective Time, Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any applicable Company
Subsidiary to, give Continuing Employees full credit for purposes of
eligibility and vesting (but not for any purposes under any Parent Benefit
Plan that is a defined benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit and
compensation plans or arrangements maintained by Parent or an applicable
Parent Subsidiary that such employees may be eligible to participate in after
the Effective Time for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or
any Company Subsidiaries to the same extent that such service was credited for
purposes of any comparable employee benefit plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time and in no event shall service prior to the Effective Time be
required to be taken into account if such service credit would result in the
duplication of benefits with respect to the same period.

(e) No provision of this Section 5.12 shall be construed as a limitation on
the right of Parent, or to cause any Parent Subsidiary to, amend or terminate
any specific employee benefit plan that Parent or a Parent Subsidiary would
otherwise have under the terms of such employee benefit plan, nor shall any
provision of this Section 5.12 be construed to require the continuation of
the employment of any particular Continuing Employee. The provisions of this
Section 5.12 are solely for the benefit of the Parties to this Agreement, and
no current or former director, officer, employee or independent contractor or
any other Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.12 of
this Agreement, and nothing herein shall be construed as an amendment to any
employee benefit plan of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or
other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement for any purpose.

 



65 Section 5.13. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection

(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.15. _Security Holder Litigation_. In the event that any litigation
related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement is brought against the Company and/or its directors by
security holders of the Company, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of
such litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
in, but not control, the defense and settlement of any such litigation against
the Company and/or its directors by security holders of the Company and no
such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that any litigation related
to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is brought against Parent and/or its directors by security holders
of Parent, Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such litigation and
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis with respect to
the status thereof. Parent shall give the Company the opportunity to
participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in, but not
control, the defense and settlement of any such litigation against Parent
and/or its directors by security holders of Parent and no such settlement
shall be agreed to by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary without the Companys
prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

Section 5.16. _Parent Board_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall take
all actions necessary to (i) increase the number of directors that constitute
the Parent Board as of the Effective Time from ten to eleven by amending the
by-laws of Parent; (ii) secure the resignation of two members of the Parent
Board such that as of the Effective Time the Parent Board shall have three
vacancies and (iii) appoint to the Parent Board, effective as of the Effective
Time, three individuals designated by the Company Board (such individuals,
the " _Company Designees_ "); _provided_ that if any Company Designee is not
a member of the Company Board as of the date hereof, such Company Designee
shall be reasonably acceptable to the Nominating and Governance Committee
of the Parent Board. The Company Designees shall serve on the Parent Board,
initially, until the next annual meeting of Parents stockholders. Parent
agrees that the Company Designees shall be nominated by the Parent Board for
election to the Parent Board at the next annual meeting of Parents
stockholders to serve until the next subsequent annual meeting of Parents
stockholders and until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified. So long as any Company Designee continues to serve on the Parent
Board, until the second annual meeting following the Closing Date, at least
one member of each committee of the Parent Board shall be a Company Designee.

 



66 Section 5.17. _Control of Businesses_. Without limiting any provisions
of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2, nothing in this Agreement shall, directly or
indirectly, give any Party control over any other Partys operations, business
or decision-making before the Effective Time, and control over all such
matters shall remain vested in the relevant Party, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.

7.3(c)(ii)(C) only, the term "Parent Acquisition Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in the definition thereof under Section 5.5

Proposal, as applicable.

 



72 (g) The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if either the Company or Parent fails promptly to pay
any amount due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such
payment, the Company or Parent, as applicable, commences a suit that results
in a judgment against the Company or Parent, as applicable, for any amount due
pursuant to this Section 7.3, the non-prevailing Party that is required to
pay any such fee shall pay the prevailing Party entitled to receive such fee
its costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in

of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties (including by facsimile or

need not sign the same counterpart.

Section 8.6. _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto), the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent
Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and (b) are not intended to confer any rights, benefits, remedies,
obligations or liabilities upon any Person other than the Parties hereto and
their respective successors and assigns, except that, notwithstanding the

Section 5.10 shall be enforceable by each Company Indemnified Party and his
or her heirs, executors or administrators and representatives, (ii) the

respect to the rights of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, Company

applicable, shall be enforceable by such holders. Parent and Merger Sub
acknowledge and agree that nothing in this Agreement precludes the Company
from asserting that its measure of damages for any breach of this Agreement by
Parent or Merger Sub includes the loss of the economic benefits of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to the holders of Company Common
Stock, whether or not this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to
Section 7.1.

 

Section 8.7. _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
(or part thereof) of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity to be invalid, void, unenforceable
or against its regulatory policy, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, so long as
the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby,
taken as a whole, are not affected in a manner materially adverse to any Party
hereto.

 

Section 8.8. _Interpretation_. The words "include," "includes," and

not they are in fact followed by such words or words of like import. The words

this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall
include the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Company Disclosure Letter. The
word "will" shall be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the
word "shall." All terms defined in this Agreement shall have the defined
meanings when used in any certificate or other document made or delivered
pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined therein. The Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter are hereby incorporated in and made a
part of this Agreement as if set forth in full herein. The definitions

referred to herein means such Contract, instrument or Law as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented in a manner consistent with this
Agreement, including (in the case of Contracts or instruments) by waiver or
consent and (in the case of Laws) by succession of comparable successor Laws
and references to all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated
therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted successors and
assigns. This Agreement is the product of negotiations by the Parties having
the assistance of counsel and other advisers. It is the intention of the
Parties that this Agreement not be construed more strictly with regard to one
Party than with regard to the others.

 

Section 8.9. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void; _provided_ that, without
the consent of any other Party, prior to the mailing of the Joint Proxy
Statement, Parent may designate, by written notice to the Company, another
wholly-owned direct or indirect Parent

 



76  Subsidiary to be a party to the Merger in lieu of Merger Sub, in which event
all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such other
Parent Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Parent
Subsidiary as of the date of such designation;  _provided_ , _further_ , that
any such designation not impede or delay the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, without the
consent of any Party, Parent may transfer the shares of common stock of
Merger Sub to any one or more direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
Parent.
