(b) At any time when the Closing Certificate remains effective and prior to
the Closing Date, the Company will determine and notify Buyer and
Representative of the portion of the Purchase Price payable to each
Shareholder for sale of the Shares owned by each Shareholder, and the portion
of the Purchase Price payable to each Optionholder and Warrantholder for the
cancellation of his or its Options and Warrants as a result of Closing, along
with each Sellers contribution to the Escrows. All of the foregoing
determinations will be based on the value of each share of Common Stock that
is being sold hereunder or which is subject to an Option or Warrant being
cancelled hereunder. Such share value (the " _Share Value_ ") will equal:

  



  

(i) the total Purchase Price, as increased by the amount payable for the
exercise of all Options and Warrants if they were to be exercised, and as
further increased by the Escrow Amounts,

  

 ** **

  

 _divided by_

  

 _ _

  

(ii) the sum of the number of Shares being sold hereunder, and the number of
shares of Common Stock subject to Options and Warrants being cancelled
hereunder (collectively, the " _Share Equivalents_ ").

  



  

(c) Each Seller will contribute into the Escrows a percentage of the Escrow
Amounts equal to his or its Proportionate Share of such Escrows.

  



  

(d) At Closing, each Shareholder will be entitled to receive the Share Value
_times_ the number of Shares being sold by such Shareholder, _less_  the
amount such Shareholder is to contribute to the Escrow Amounts (the
net aggregate amount to be received by all the Shareholders being the "
_Aggregate Shareholder Amount_ ").

  



  

(e) At Closing, each Optionholder and Warrantholder will be entitled to
receive the Share Value (as reduced by the weighted average exercise price
per Share under all Options or Warrants held by such Optionholder or
Warrantholder) _times_ the number of shares subject to Options or Warrants
held by such Optionholder or Warrantholder that are being cancelled, _less_
the amount such Optionholder or Warrantholder is to contribute to the Escrow
Amounts (the net aggregate amount to be received by all the Optionholders
being the " _Aggregate Optionholder Amount_ ," and the aggregate amount to be
received by all the Warrantholders being the " _Aggregate Warrantholder
Amount_ "), less any applicable Tax withholding.

  



        
   

  



  

Section 2.3 _Deemed Increase in Purchase Price; Withholding_. Any portion
of the Escrows disbursed under the Escrow Agreement to any Seller, and any
portion of any Tax refund, credit, or benefit paid to any Seller pursuant to
_Section 6.2(h) _or  _(i)_ , will be deemed an increase to the Purchase
Price for the purchase or cancellation of such Persons interest in his or
its Securities. Such amount payable to each Seller who is or was an employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be subject to any applicable
Tax withholding.

  



  

Section 2.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Purchase Price will be adjusted
as set forth in this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

(a) _Calculation of Final Working Capital_. On or before 60 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer will deliver to Representative a balance sheet dated as
of the Closing Date and prepared in good faith (the " _Proposed Final Balance
Sheet_ ") showing the amounts of Company Cash and Company Indebtedness along
with a calculation of the Working Capital determined in accordance with the
Working Capital Exhibit (the " _Proposed Final Working Capital_ ," and
collectively with the Proposed Final Balance Sheet, the " _Proposed Final
Statements_ "), all as of the Closing Date and based on the Proposed Final
Balance Sheet. If Buyer does not deliver Proposed Final Statements to
Representative in such 60-day period, then Representative, in its sole
discretion, may prepare and deliver Proposed Final Statements to Buyer,
and Buyer will give Representative access to all books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and will allow Representative to consult with
the Companys accountants, and will fully cooperate with and assist
Representative, so as to enable Representative to prepare its Proposed Final
Statements. Within 20 days of receipt of such Proposed Final Statements,
Representative or Buyer, as applicable, may give written notice to the
Company and Buyer, on one hand, or to Representative, on the other hand, as
applicable, that it disputes certain items contained in any of the Proposed
Final Statements (the " _Dispute Notice_ "), which notice will specify in
reasonable detail the dollar amount of any objection and the basis therefor;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if Buyer or Representative, as applicable, does
not deliver a Dispute Notice by such date, it will be deemed to have accepted
the Proposed Final Statements prepared by the other party and the Proposed
Final Statements will be final and binding on all parties. Upon timely
delivery of the Dispute Notice, Buyer and Representative agree to confer in
good faith with regard to the disputed items and an appropriate adjustment to
the Proposed Final Statements will be made to the extent agreed upon by Buyer
and Representative. If within 30 days after delivery of a Dispute Notice,
Buyer and Representative are unable to resolve the matter, either of them may
within 30 days after the end of the previous 30 day period notify in writing:
(i) the other party, and (ii) KPMG LLP **** or another firm of
independent accountants selected jointly by Buyer and Representative (the "
_Reviewing Accountant_ "), who will adjudicate only those items still in
dispute with respect to the Proposed Final Statements.  Buyer and
Representative will have the opportunity to provide written submissions
regarding their positions on the disputed matters, which written submissions
will be provided to the Reviewing Accountant, if at all, no later than 20
days after the date of referral of the disputed matters to the Reviewing
Accountant. The determination of the Reviewing Accountant will be based
solely on the written submissions by Buyer and Representative and their
respective representatives and will not be by independent review. The
Reviewing Accountant will deliver a written report resolving only the
disputed matters and setting forth the basis for such resolution within 30
days after Buyer and Representative have submitted in writing (or have had
the opportunity to submit in writing but have not submitted) their positions
as to the disputed items. The determination of the Reviewing

  



        
   

  



  

Accountant with respect to each matter in dispute will be final and binding
on Buyer, Representative, and the Sellers. The fees, costs, and expenses of
the Reviewing Accountant will be borne entirely by the party whose assertions
regarding the Final Working Capital, Final Company Cash, and Final Company
Indebtedness differ in the aggregate by the greatest amount from the Final
Working Capital, Final Company Cash, and Final Company Indebtedness, in the
aggregate, as determined by the Reviewing Accountant.  The closing balance
sheet agreed upon by Buyer and Representative (or deemed accepted by them
under this subsection, as adjusted, if necessary based on the adjustments
decided by the Reviewing Accountant) under this _Section 2.4(a) _is referred
to herein as the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ " and the final calculation of the
Company Cash, Company Indebtedness, and Working Capital reflected on or
derived in whole or in part from such Closing Balance Sheet will be referred
to as the " _Final Company Cash_ ," " _Final Company Indebtedness_ ," and "
_Final Working Capital_ ," respectively.

  



  

(b) _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(i) If the Final Working Capital is less than the Estimated Working Capital,
then the Purchase Price will be decreased by such difference.

  



  

(ii) If the Final Working Capital is greater than the Estimated Working
Capital, then the Purchase Price will be increased by such difference.

  



  

(iii) If the Final Company Indebtedness is less than the Company Indebtedness
reflected on the Closing Certificate, then the Purchase Price will be
increased by such difference.

  



  

(iv) If the Final Company Indebtedness is greater than the Company
Indebtedness reflected on the Closing Certificate, then the Purchase Price
will be decreased by such difference.

  



  

(v) If the Final Company Cash is greater than the Company Cash reflected on
the Closing Certificate, then the Purchase Price will be increased by
such difference.

  



  

(vi) If the Final Company Cash is less than the Company Cash reflected on the
Closing Company Certificate, then the Purchase Price will be decreased by
such difference.

  



  

If the Purchase Price, adjusted as provided above (the " _Adjusted Purchase
Price_ "), is greater than the Purchase Price paid by Buyer at Closing (such
surplus being the " _Purchase Price Surplus_ "), then (i) Buyer will pay to
each Seller (or as directed by Representative on behalf of each Seller) his
or its such Proportionate Share of the Purchase Price Surplus, and (ii)
Buyer and Representative will deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate (the
" _Purchase Price Surplus Certificate_ ") signed by each of them instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay to each Seller his or its Proportionate Share of the
Working Capital Escrow Fund. If the Adjusted Purchase Price is less than the
Purchase Price paid by Buyer at Closing (such deficiency being the "
_Purchase Price Deficiency_ "), then Buyer and Representative will deliver to
the Escrow Agent a certificate (the " _Purchase Price Deficiency Certificate_
") signed by each of them instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer the
amount of the Purchase Price Deficiency from the Working Capital Escrow Fund
and to distribute the remaining amount, if any, in the Working Capital Escrow
Fund to each

  



        
   

  



  

Seller (or as directed by Representative on behalf of each Seller) based on
his or its Proportionate Share of such remaining amount. If the Purchase Price
Deficiency exceeds the Working Capital Escrow Amount (such difference being
the " _Escrow Deficiency_ "), then the Purchase Price Deficiency Certificate
will instruct the Escrow Agent to disburse the entire amount in the Working
Capital Escrow Fund to Buyer and to pay to Buyer the remaining amount of the
Purchase Price Deficiency from the Indemnity Escrow Fund. In the event
any payment made to Buyer for an Escrow Deficiency from the Indemnity Escrow
Fund causes the Indemnity Escrow Fund to decrease below $8,000,000 within six
months after the Closing Date, then each Seller will be obligated severally,
but not jointly, based on written notice from Buyer and Representative, to
immediately deposit with the Escrow Agent his or its Proportionate Share of
the portion of the Escrow Deficiency paid from the Indemnity Escrow Fund that
caused the Indemnity Escrow Fund to decrease below $8,000,000 such that the
aggregate of all such deposits from the Sellers will increase the amount in
the Indemnity Escrow Fund to $8,000,000; _provided, however_ , that each
Seller will be liable to make such deposit only up to, and in no event in
excess of, an amount which, together with all other amounts paid by such
Seller, or from his or its Proportionate Share of the Escrow Amounts pursuant
to _Article VI_ or _Article VIII_, does not exceed his or its Proportionate
Share of the Purchase Price paid by Buyer and the Company at Closing. Any
payment required to be delivered pursuant to this _Section 2.4_ as a result
of a Purchase Price Surplus or Purchase Price Deficiency will be delivered
within 10 Business Days after the Closing Balance Sheet becomes final and
binding as provided in _Section 2.4_ and any applicable notice is delivered.

  



  

(c) _No Affect on Other Rights_. The determination and adjustment of
the Purchase Price in accordance with the provisions of this Section will
not limit or affect any other rights or causes of action either Buyer or
each Seller may have with respect to the representations, warranties,
covenants, and indemnities in his or its favor contained in this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2.5 _Closing_.

  



  

(a) The closing (" _Closing_ ") of the sale and purchase of the Shares and
the cancellation of the Options and Warrants will take place at the offices
of Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher LLP, 2100 McKinney Avenue, Suite 1100, Dallas,
Texas 75201, at 10:00 A.M. C.T. on the fifth Business Day following the

(ii) Buyer will deliver, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a

the Company will be solely responsible for the distribution of such amounts
to the Optionholders and Warrantholders for cancellation of their Options
and Warrants, less any applicable Tax withholding, which withholding amounts
the Company will remit to the applicable Tax authorities.

  



  

(iii) Buyer will deposit with the Escrow Agent the Escrow Amounts to be held
and disbursed by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow Agreement.

  



  

(iv) Buyer will pay to each lender under the Company Loan Agreements that

(v) In satisfaction of a portion of its obligations to the Sellers pursuant
to _Section 6.2(i)_, Buyer will deliver, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the bank account designated in writing by an officer of

amount equal to the portion of the Tax Benefit Payment allocable to the
cancellation of options owned by employees of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. At Closing, the Company will be solely responsible for the
distribution of such amount to the Sellers who are employees of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries according to their Proportionate Shares as an
addition to the Purchase Price.  In satisfaction of the remainder of its
obligations to the Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.2(i)_, Buyer will deliver,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank accounts
designated in writing by Representative to Buyer at least two Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, the remainder of the Tax Benefit Payment as a
further addition to the Purchase Price.

arrangements made by or on behalf of Buyer.

  



  

Section 4.6 _Investment Intent_. Buyer is acquiring the Shares for its
own account for investment purposes only and not with a view to any
public distribution thereof or with any intention of selling, distributing,
or otherwise disposing of the Shares in a manner that would violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
" _Securities Act_ "), or any state securities laws.  Buyer agrees that the
Shares may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, hypothecated,
or otherwise disposed of without registration under the Securities Act and
any applicable state securities laws, except pursuant to an exemption from
such registration under the Securities Act and such laws. Buyer and its
owners are able to bear the economic risk of holding the Shares for an
indefinite period (including total loss of Buyers investment), and Buyer has
sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and business matters so as
to be capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Shares.

Section 5.2 _Covenants Regarding Information_.

  



  

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date, upon reasonable notice, the
Company and its Subsidiaries will afford Buyer and its officers, employees,
agents, accountants, advisors, bankers, and other representatives
(collectively, " _Buyer Representatives_ ") reasonable access to the
properties, offices, plants, and other facilities, books, and records of the
Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and will furnish Buyer with such
financial, operating, and other data and information as Buyer may reasonably
request and will make the directors, officers, and employees of the Company
and the Subsidiaries available to the Buyer Representatives as they may from
time to time reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any such access
or furnishing of information will be conducted at Buyers expense, during
normal business hours (except for an inventory of physical assets), under the
supervision of the Companys personnel, and in such a manner as not
unreasonably to interfere with the normal operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries will be required to disclose
any information to Buyer or any Buyer Representatives if such disclosure
would, as determined by the Company or Representative in the sole discretion
of either, (i) jeopardize any attorney-client or other privilege, or (ii)
contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty, or binding agreement entered
into prior to the date hereof.

  



  

(b) In order to facilitate the resolution of any claims made against or
incurred by any Sellers (as related to the Company and its Subsidiaries), for
a period of six years after Closing, Buyer will (i) retain the books and
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to
Closing, and (ii) afford Representative and each Seller reasonable access
(including the right to make, at Representatives or any Sellers expense,
photocopies), during normal business hours, to such books and records.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) Within a reasonable amount of time prior to Closing, which reasonable
amount of time will be not less than seven Business Days prior to Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries will provide Buyer, upon the request of
Buyer, the opportunity to review any non-privileged data, information, or
other materials related to the attainment of the Shareholder Vote as
described in _Section 3.15(r)_. Such data, information, and other
materials will include, but not be limited to, any shareholder disclosure
statements or schedules, any "disqualified individual" waiver of payments or
benefits, any schedule of shareholders eligible to participate in the
Shareholder Vote and their respective voting shares or percentages, any Code
Section 280G analyses prepared in connection with said Shareholder Vote, any
additional non-privileged data, information, or other materials necessary to
support such Code Section 280G analyses and any such additional information
as the Buyer may reasonably request in connection with the Shareholder
Vote process. Additionally, not less than one Business Day prior to Closing,
the Company and its Subsidiaries will provide Buyer with the results of the
Shareholder Vote conducted in accordance with _Section 3.15(r)_.

  



  

Section 5.3 _Update of Disclosure Schedule_. The Company and Representative,
on behalf of the Sellers, as applicable, from time to time prior to Closing
will supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedule with respect to any events
or conditions arising or discovered after the date hereof and prior to
Closing which if existing or known at the date of this Agreement would have
been required to be set forth or described in the Disclosure Schedule. No
such supplemental or amended disclosure will be deemed to have cured any
breach of any representation or warranty made in this Agreement for purposes
of determining whether or not the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have
been satisfied, but will be deemed to have cured any such breach for purposes
of the indemnifications provided for in _Article VI_ or _Article
VIII_, but if and only to the extent the events or conditions set forth or
described in the supplemental or amended disclosure were not known by the
Company as of the date hereof and would not have been discovered by the
Company as of the date hereof by the exercise of reasonable care in
investigating the facts underlying the representations and warranties
contained herein.

  



  

Section 5.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Until Closing, each of Buyer
and Representative will promptly notify the other in writing of any fact,
change, condition, circumstance, or occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event
of which it is aware that will or is reasonably likely to result in any of
the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ of this Agreement becoming
incapable of being satisfied. After Closing, immediately upon completion
of the audited financial statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for
2008, each of Buyer and the Company will notify Representative of such
completion.

  



  

Section 5.5 _Intercompany Arrangements_. Except for contracts set forth in
_Section 5.5_ of the Disclosure Schedule, all contracts between the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Sellers and their Affiliates
(other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other hand, will be
cancelled without any consideration or further liability to any party and
without the need for any further documentation, immediately prior to Closing.

  



  

Section 5.6 _No Solicitation_. If this Agreement is terminated prior
to Closing, Buyer and Buyer Representatives will not, for a period of two
years thereafter, without the prior written consent of Representative,
solicit (other than a solicitation by general advertisement) any person who
is an executive, manager, or highly paid employee or other key employee of
the Company

  



        
   

  



  

or any of its Subsidiaries to terminate his employment with the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries. Buyer agrees that any remedy at law for any breach
by Buyer of this _Section 5.6_ would be inadequate, and that Representative
and the Company would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it
is ever held that this restriction on Buyer is too onerous and is
not necessary for the protection of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
Buyer agrees that any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such
lesser restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or
appropriate properly to protect the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 5.7 _Confidentiality_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties will hold, and will cause its agents and
representatives (including all Buyer Representatives) to hold, in confidence
all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of the other
parties in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to
the terms of the confidentiality agreement dated June 20, 2007 between Buyer
and Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which will continue in full force and effect until the Closing Date, at which
time such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of the parties under
this _Section 5.7_ will terminate. If for any reason this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement will
nonetheless continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

  



  

(b) Buyer agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by Buyer of this
_Section 5.7_ would be inadequate, and that Representative and the Company
would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held
that this restriction on Buyer is too onerous and is not necessary for
the protection of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, Buyer agrees that
any court of competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser restrictions which
such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate properly to protect
the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

Section 5.8 _Consents and Filings; Further Assurances_.

  



  

(a) Each of the parties will use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper, or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements on or before December 10, 2007 (or as soon
thereafter as practicable if all such commercially reasonable efforts do not
result in the occurrence of the Closing on or before December 10, 2007)
including to (i) obtain from Governmental Entities and other Persons all
consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications, and orders as are
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, and (ii) promptly make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, with respect to
this Agreement required under any applicable Law.

  



  

(b) Each of Representative, the Sellers, the Company and Buyer will promptly
notify the others of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives
from any Governmental Entity relating to the matters that are the subject of
this Agreement and permit the other to review in advance any proposed
communication by such party or its Affiliate to any Governmental Entity.
Neither Buyer nor Representative will agree to participate, or allow its
Affiliates to participate, in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filings,

  



        
   

  



  

investigation, or other inquiry unless it consults with the other in advance
and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other or
its designee the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, Representative, the Sellers, the
Company and Buyer will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other
in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other
may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking
early termination of any applicable waiting periods.  Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of Representative and Buyer will provide each
other with copies of all correspondence, filings, or communications between
it or any of their agents or representatives, on the one hand, and any
Governmental Entity or members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(c) Buyer, Representative, the Sellers and the Company will (a) promptly take
all actions necessary to make the filings required of such parties or their
Affiliates under the HSR Act, (b) comply at the earliest practicable date
with any request for additional information received by the filing parties
from the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of the Department
of Justice pursuant to the HSR Act, and (c) cooperate in connection with each
partys filing under the HSR Act and in connection with resolving any
investigation or other inquiry concerning the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement commenced by the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice, or any state attorney general. All
filing fees required in connection with any filings required of Buyer,
Representative, the Sellers or the Company or their Affiliates under the HSR
Act to be paid to the Federal Trade Commission or the Antitrust Division of
the Department of Justice will be paid by Buyer. If any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under the HSR
Act or if any litigation is instituted or threatened by any Governmental
Entity or any private party challenging any of the transactions contemplated
hereby as violative of the HSR Act, Buyer, Representative, the Sellers and
the Company will each use their commercially reasonable efforts promptly to
resolve such objections.

  



  

Section 5.9 _Estoppels; Pay-off Letters_. The Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from each lessor under each Real
Property Lease an estoppel certificate, effective as of the Closing Date,
substantially in the form of _Exhibit E_. The Company agrees to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with Buyer in Buyers attempts
to obtain satisfactory pay-off letters from the lenders of the Company Loan
Agreements.

  



  

Section 5.10 _Public Announcements_. From the date hereof and until 10 days
following the Closing Date, Representative and Buyer will consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statement with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and will not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may
be required by applicable Law or by the rules of any stock exchange. Anything
in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, United Stationers Inc. may
file a Form 8-K with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and/or
publicly issue a press release, in each case, with respect to this Agreement
or its contents or the transactions contemplated hereby (the contents of
which Form 8-K and press release will be determined by United Stationers Inc.
in its sole discretion).

  



        
   

  



  

Section 5.11 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing, Buyer will cause the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, and the Company will, indemnify, defend, and hold harmless
each person or entity that is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director or
limited liability company manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(the " _D and O Indemnified Parties_"), against any and all losses, damages,
liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards, judgments, penalties,
costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs, and other
out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating, preparing, or defending the
foregoing) arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual claim,
action, suit, proceeding, or investigation based in whole or in part on or
arising out of or relating in whole or in part to the fact that such person
is or was a director, officer, or limited liability company manager of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether pertaining to any matter existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or claimed
prior to, or at or after, the Closing Date (the " _D and O Indemnified
Liabilities_"), in each case to the full extent a corporation or limited
liability company is permitted under applicable Law to indemnify its own
directors, officers, or limited liability company managers, and Buyer will
cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries will, pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any
such action or proceeding to each DandO Indemnified Party. Without limiting
the foregoing, from and after the Closing, in the event any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding, or investigation is brought against any DandO
Indemnified Party (whether arising before or after the Closing Date), (i)
the DandO Indemnified Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and Buyer
will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries will, pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO
Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefore are received, and (ii)
Buyer will cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to, and the Company and its
Subsidiaries will, use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous
defense of any such matter, and the Seller Indemnifying Parties will cause
each DandO Indemnified Party to use all reasonable efforts to assist in the
vigorous defense of any such matter. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to
claim indemnification under this _Section 5.11_ will notify Buyer and the
Company upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding, or
investigation (but the failure so to notify will not relieve a party from any
liability which it may have under this _Section 5.11_ except to the extent
such failure prejudices such party). The parties hereto agree that all rights
to indemnification hereunder, including provisions relating to advances
of expenses incurred in defense of any such action or suit, existing in favor
of the DandO Indemnified Parties with respect to matters occurring through the
Closing Date will continue in full force and effect for a period of not less
than six years from the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , __ that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any DandO Indemnified
Liabilities asserted or made within such period will continue until the
disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities.

  

 ** _ _**

  

(b) On or before Closing, the Company will purchase the "extended reporting
period" for the policies of insurance listed in _Exhibit F_ for a six-
year period. The Company will omit from Working Capital the cost of the
premiums for such extended reporting periods in an amount not to exceed
$143,500 (the " _Premium Expense_ ").

  

 ** _ _**

  

(c) The Company will not take any action directly or indirectly to disaffirm
or adversely affect the provisions of the articles of organization and bylaws
and any other written

  



        
   

  



  

agreements of the Company and its Subsidiaries that provide indemnification
of and expense reimbursement to DandO Indemnified Parties, a list of which
agreements, if any, is set forth in _Section 5.11_ of the Disclosure
Schedule.

Section 5.12 _Exclusivity_. During the period from the date of this Agreement
to the earlier of the Closing Date or the date this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to _Article IX_, no Seller will, and neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary will, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, condone,
knowingly encourage, or respond to any inquiries, proposals or offers from,
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with, or provide any
of their confidential information to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with,
any Person (other than Buyer and its directors, officers,
employees, representatives and agents) regarding (a) any merger,
consolidation or sale or other disposition of any capital stock of the
Company or any Subsidiary (including any sale of any of the Shares), or (b)
any sale or other disposition of all or any substantial portion of the assets
or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary (or any unit or division
thereof) (excluding the sale of inventory in the Ordinary Course).  The
Company will promptly notify Buyer in writing of each instance in which the
Company receives any such inquiry, proposal, or offer; _provided_ , that the
Company will not be obligated to communicate to Buyer the terms and
conditions of (or the identity of the Person making) any such inquiry,
proposal, or offer received.

 TAX MATTERS**

  

# ** **

  

Section 6.1 _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, and other such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording
charges, and other fees and charges (including any penalties and interest)
incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will be borne by Buyer. Buyer and the Sellers will
reasonably cooperate with one another in timely making all Returns as may be
required to comply with the provisions of applicable transfer tax laws.

  



  

Section 6.2 _Tax Indemnification and Other Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the limitation in _Section 8.5(b)(i)(B)_, the Seller
Indemnifying Parties will indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties for all Taxes
of the Company and its Subsidiaries to the extent such Taxes are not
adequately provided for as current Taxes on the Closing Balance Sheet (i) for
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date, (ii) for any taxable
period not ending on or before the Closing Date, for the portion of any Taxes
attributable to such period ending on the Closing Date, and (iii) for which
the Company or any Subsidiary may be liable under Treasury Regulation
§1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local, or foreign law) with
respect to any combined, consolidated, affiliated, or unitary group other
than any such group in which Buyer or any of its current Affiliates (or any
of their respective successors) is a member, as a transferee or successor, by
Contract, or otherwise; _provided, however_ , that any Taxes of the Company
or any Subsidiary resulting from the denial of any deduction, other than a
denial pursuant to Section 280G of the Code, for the payment of any amounts
to any Optionholder or Warrantholder pursuant to this Agreement, or for the
payment of any Unamortized Financing Cost, or from the denial of
any deduction for any Transaction Costs claimed on any Tax Return, will not
be subject to this indemnity.

  



        
   

  



  

(b) For purposes of applying _Section 6.2(a) _to any period that includes
but does not end on the Closing Date, (i) Taxes determined by reference to
income, capital gains, gross income, gross receipts, sales, net profits,
windfall profits, or similar items will be allocated between the portion of
such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such period after
the Closing Date based on the date on which the relevant items of income and
expense accrued (i.e., an interim closing of the tax books as of the Closing
Date), and (ii) liability for all other Taxes will be allocated between the
portion of such period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such
period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each
such portion of such period.

  



  

(c) Representative will have the exclusive right to prepare, or cause to be
prepared and filed, and the Company will sign upon request by Representative,
all Tax Returns and reports (including any amendments and refund claims with
respect thereto) of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to Tax
periods described in _Section 6.2(a)(i)_, which Returns and reports will be
prepared and filed timely on a basis consistent with existing procedures for
preparing such Returns and reports and in a manner consistent with prior
practice; _provided_ , that the federal income Tax return for the last period
described in _Section 6.2(a)(i) _will claim as a deduction to the maximum
extent permitted by Law all Transaction Costs and payments hereunder to any
Optionholder, Warrantholder, or employee of the Company, and the Company and
each Subsidiary will elect to carry back any net operating losses reflected
on such return, to the maximum extent permitted by Law; _provided, further,_
that all such Returns and reports will not be filed until Buyer has had 20
days to review the Return or report proposed to be filed by the Seller
Indemnifying Parties and has consented to the filing of such Return or
report, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned. The Company will sign such Return or report upon request by
Representative. The Company will provide Representative with all information,
and access to all books and records, of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as
necessary or requested by Representative in order to prepare and file, or
cause to be prepared and filed, the Tax Returns and reports (including any
amendments and refund claims with respect thereto) provided for above in this
_Section 6.2(c)_, and Representative will not be deemed to have breached
this Agreement or have any liability whatsoever if it does not prepare, or
cause to be prepared and filed, any Tax Returns and reports (including any
amendments and refund claims with respect thereto) provided for above in this
_Section 6.2(c)_, or if any such Tax Returns and reports are incomplete or
inaccurate, due to any failure of the Company to provide any such information
or access to books and records. The Company will prepare and file all other
Tax Returns and reports of the Company and its Subsidiaries due after the
Closing Date, which Returns and reports, to the extent they relate to taxable
periods beginning prior to, but including the Closing Date, and for
the purpose of determining the liability of the Seller Indemnifying Parties
for Taxes, will be prepared and filed timely and on a basis consistent
with existing procedures for preparing such Returns and in a manner
consistent with prior practice. The Company will bear the costs of preparing
all the Returns and reports described in this _Section 6.2(c)_, subject to
_Section 6.2(d)_.  In the event the Seller Indemnifying Parties are liable
under _Section 6.2(a) _for Taxes due in connection with the Returns and
reports described in this _Section 6.2_, Buyer and Representative will
deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate signed by each of them instructing
the Escrow Agent to pay to Buyer Indemnified Parties from the Indemnity
Escrow Fund an amount equal to such Taxes. Anything in this _Section 6.2(c)
_to the contrary notwithstanding, Representative will not have any control
or participation rights with respect to the Returns and reports referenced in
the first sentence of this _Section 6.2(c) _at and

  



        
   

  



  

after the time there are no funds, or it becomes reasonably certain that
there will be no funds, in the Indemnity Escrow Fund with which to make
payments pursuant to _Section 6.2(g)_.

  



  

(d) Representative, Buyer, and the Company will provide each other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by the other in connection with the
preparation of any Return or report of Taxes, any amendment or refund claim
with respect thereto, any audit or other examination by any Governmental
Entity, or any Proceedings relating to liabilities for Taxes. Any cost or
expense of such cooperation will be paid by the party incurring such expense
(and not by the requesting party).  The Company will retain for the full
period of any statute of limitations and provide the others with any records
or information which may be relevant to such preparation, audit, examination,
Proceeding, or determination.

  



  

(e) Buyer represents and warrants to Sellers that it is a member of an
affiliated group filing a consolidated federal income Tax Return, and that it
will take the position in its federal income Tax filings that the current
taxable year of the Company and its corporate Subsidiaries will end on the
Closing Date, thus making the current federal income Tax year of the Company
and its corporate Subsidiaries a Tax period ending on the Closing Date for
purposes of _Section 6.2(a)_.

  



  

(f) If in connection with any examination, investigation, audit, or other
Proceeding in respect of any Tax Return covering the operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries on or before the Closing Date, any Governmental
Entity issues to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries a written notice of
deficiency, a notice of reassessment, a proposed adjustment, an assertion of
claim, or demand concerning the taxable period covered by such Return, Buyer
will notify Representative of its receipt of such communication from the
Governmental Entity within 30 Business Days after receiving such notice of
deficiency, reassessment, adjustment, or assertion of claim or demand. No
failure or delay of Buyer in the performance of the foregoing will reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Seller Indemnifying
Parties pursuant to this Agreement, except to the extent that such failure or
delay will have adversely affected the ability of the Seller Indemnifying
Parties to defend against any liability or claim for Taxes that the Seller
Indemnifying Parties are obligated to pay hereunder.  Except as provided
below, Representative will, at its expense, have the exclusive right to
control the contest (a " _Pre-Close Tax Contest_ ") of any such assessment,
proposal, claim, reassessment, demand, or other Proceedings in connection
with any Tax Return covering taxable periods of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries described in _Section 6.2(a)(i)_, and the nonexclusive right to
participate in the contest (an " _Other Tax Contest_ ") of any such
assessment, proposal, claim, reassessment, demand, or other Proceedings in
connection with any Tax Return covering taxable periods of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries described in _Section 6.2(a)(ii)_. Buyer or its designee
will have the nonexclusive right to participate in any Pre-Close Tax Contest,
and Representative will forward copies of all correspondence and other
documents it sends or receives in connection with any such contest to Buyer
or its designee on a timely basis. Representative will not settle or resolve
any issue related to Taxes in any Pre-Close Tax Contest if such settlement or
resolution could have an adverse effect on Buyer or the Company for periods
after the Closing Date, without Buyers written consent which will not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. Buyer will, at its expense,
have the exclusive right to control the Other Tax Contests. Neither Buyer,
nor any Buyer Indemnified Party, nor the Company will settle or resolve any
issue related to Taxes in any Other Tax Contest that results in

  



         
 

  

a liability of the Seller Indemnifying Parties under  _Section 6.2(a)
_without Representatives written consent which will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned. Representative, Buyer Indemnified
Parties, and the Company will each bear its own costs and expenses incurred
in connection with their participation in any Proceeding described in this
_Section 6.2(f)_. Anything in this _Section 6.2(f) _to the contrary
notwithstanding, Representative will not have any control or participation
rights with respect to any Pre-Close Tax Contest or Other Tax Contest at and
after the time there are no funds, or it becomes reasonably certain that
there will be no funds, in the Indemnity Escrow Fund with which to make
payments pursuant to _Section 6.2(g)_.

  



  

(g) If there is an adjustment to any Return or report of Taxes for the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries that creates a deficiency in any Taxes for
which the Seller Indemnifying Parties are liable under the provisions of
_Section 6.2(a)_, Buyer and Representative will deliver to the Escrow Agent
a certificate signed by each of them instructing the Escrow Agent to pay to
Buyer Indemnified Parties from the Indemnity Escrow Fund an amount equal to
such deficiency. Such payments from the Indemnity Escrow Fund constitute the
exclusive means to satisfy the liabilities of the Seller Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to this _Article VI_, and the Buyer Indemnified Parties will have
no recourse against the Seller Indemnifying Parties for any such liability
whether or not the Indemnity Escrow Fund is sufficient for such purpose.

  



  

(h) The Sellers will be entitled to any overpayments of Taxes, and any
related interest, attributable to any taxable period or portion thereof
described in _Section 6.2(a)_, that are received by the Company or any
Subsidiary as refunds or that are credited for the benefit of the Company or
any Subsidiary or Buyer Indemnified Parties against any Tax liability for any
subsequent taxable period, but only to the extent such overpayments in the
aggregate exceed the sum of the Tax Benefit Payment (as defined in _Section
6.2(i)_) _plus_ , as determined at the end of the applicable statute of
limitations, any underpayment of Taxes that would have been a liability of
the Seller Indemnified Parties that would otherwise be payable by the Seller
Indemnifying Parties or from the Indemnity Escrow Fund but for the
limitations set forth in _Section 6.2(a) _and  _(g) _(the " _Tax
Underpayment_ "). Promptly upon receipt of any such refund or application of
such credit, Buyer will, or will cause the Company or a Subsidiary to,
promptly notify Representative and, at the time, and from time to time, if
ever, when the aggregate amount of such refunds and credits exceed the sum of
the Tax Benefit Payment and the Tax Underpayment, if any, promptly pay to
Representative an amount in cash equal to such excess plus any such
interest attributable to such excess for disbursement to Sellers according to
their Proportionate Shares. With respect to taxable periods described in
_Section 6.2(a)(ii) _and _(iii)_ , only the part of a refund attributable to
the portion of such taxable periods that ends on the Closing Date is subject
to this _Section 6.2(h)_. For purposes of this _Section 6.2(h)_, the
"applicable statute of limitations" means the statutes of limitations
applicable to the Company and its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(i) At Closing, Buyer will pay to Representative (for disbursement to the
Sellers according to their Proportionate Shares) an amount in cash equal to
$6,515,000 (the " _Tax Benefit Payment_ "). For the avoidance of doubt,
anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, (i) in the event
the Company or any Subsidiary has a net operating loss carryover for federal
income Tax purposes (or any state or local Tax equivalent thereof) from any
taxable period described in _Section 6.2(a)(i) _that is carried over to, and
utilized to reduce Taxes paid by any Person, in any subsequent taxable
period, Sellers will not be entitled to any

  



        
   

  



  

payment or other benefit resulting from such net operating loss carryover
utilization, and (ii) neither Representative nor Sellers nor the Seller
Indemnifying Parties will ever be required under any circumstances to
directly or indirectly return or refund any portion of the Tax Benefit
Payment or indemnify any party therefor except pursuant to an
indemnity obligation under Section 6.2(a) caused by the denial of a
deduction under Section 280G of the Code.

  



  

(j) This _Section 6.2_, together with the provisions of _Article VIII_ that
specifically reference and apply to this _Article VI_, provide the
exclusive indemnity for any Taxes.

Section 8.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, and Certain Covenants_.
The representations and warranties of any Seller, the Company,
Representative, and Buyer contained in this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements and any certificate delivered pursuant hereto will survive Closing

Section 8.2 _Indemnification by the Sellers_.

  



  

(a) Subject to the other provisions of this _Article VIII_, including
_Section 8.5_ below, the Sellers and their heirs, successors, and assigns
(collectively, the " _Seller Indemnifying Parties_ ") will save, defend,
indemnify, and hold harmless Buyer and its successors and assigns
(collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any and
all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, claims, interest, awards,
judgments, penalties, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees, costs, and other out-of-pocket expenses incurred in investigating,
preparing, or defending the foregoing) (hereinafter collectively, " _Losses_
") to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by or on behalf of the
Company, the Sellers, or Representative contained in this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreements or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto,
excluding representations and warranties made in _Section 3.15_, the breach
of which results in a payment of additional Taxes;

  



  

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement by the Sellers or Representative
contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement that survives Closing;

  



  

(iii) any obligations or liabilities relating to or arising from any product
liability or warranty claims based on products or services sold by the
Company or any Subsidiary on or prior to the Closing Date (except to the
extent that any Buyer Indemnified Party collects reimbursements for such
losses from insurance proceeds or from indemnification payments received from
one or more third parties);

  



  

(iv) any and all reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and costs of
investigation and litigation incurred by a Buyer Indemnified Party in
enforcing its rights under this Section but only if the Seller Indemnifying
Parties are ultimately liable to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
the Loss at issue.

  



  

(b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding:

  



  

(i) each Seller Indemnifying Party alone will be liable for any breach of a
representation as to itself or a covenant or obligation to be performed by it
under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.  Each such Seller
Indemnifying Party will be considered

  



        
   

  



  

the Indemnifying Party (as defined below and for purposes of this _Article
VIII_) for such purpose; and

  



  

(ii) in no event will any Seller Indemnifying Parties have any liability
hereunder with respect to a matter (A) specifically identified in any
Financial Statements or Interim Financial Statements, or (B) for which there
is a reserve or accrual intended to cover such matter in the Closing Balance
Sheet (but only up to the amount of such reserve or accrual not otherwise
relieved by other matters), or (C) if such matter was included in determining
the Adjusted Purchase Price pursuant to  _Article II_.

  



  

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Buyer will save, defend, indemnify,
and hold harmless the Sellers, and the heirs, successors, and assigns of the
foregoing (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any and all Losses arising out of or resulting from:

  



  

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Buyer contained in
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or any certificate delivered
pursuant hereto;

  



  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement by Buyer contained in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement which survives Closing;

  



  

(c) any claim or cause of action by any Person against any Seller Indemnified
Party with respect to the operations of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries on or after the Closing Date; and

  



  

(d) any and all reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and costs of
investigation and litigation incurred by a Seller Indemnified Party
in enforcing its rights under this Section but only if the Buyer
Indemnifying Parties are ultimately liable to indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties for the Loss at issue.

  



  

Section 8.4 _Procedures_.

  



  

(a) In order for a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party (the
" _Indemnified Party_ ") to be entitled to any indemnification provided for
under this Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a Loss or a
claim or demand made or effected by any Person against the Indemnified Party
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party will deliver notice
thereof to the party against whom indemnity is sought (the " _Indemnifying
Party_ ") promptly after receipt by such Indemnified Party of written notice
of the Third Party Claim, describing in reasonable detail the facts giving
rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method of
computation of the amount of such claim (if known) and such other information
with respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.  The
failure to provide such notice, however, will not release the
Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such
failure.

  



  

(b) The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days of receipt of notice from the Indemnified
Party of the commencement of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense
thereof at the expense of the

  



        
   

  



  

Indemnifying Party with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party
and reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying
Party assumes the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party
will have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in the
defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the
expense of the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will cooperate with
the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to the Indemnifying
Party all witnesses, pertinent records, materials, and information in the
Indemnified Partys possession or under the Indemnified Partys control
relating thereto as is reasonably required by the Indemnifying Party. Whether
or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle,
compromise, or discharge, or offer to settle, compromise, or discharge, such
Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or conditioned. In
the event the Indemnifying Party does not elect to assume the defense of a
Third Party Claim, then any failure of an Indemnified Party to defend or to
participate in the defense of such claim or to cause the same to be done will
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder.

  



  

### In the event the Indemnifying Party fails to assume or continue the
defense of a Third Party Claim after timely notice under _Section
8.4(a)_, then (i) the Indemnified Party may assume control of the defense of
such Third Party Claim which will be at the cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party if the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnity
hereunder due to the facts on which such claim is based, and (ii) the
Indemnifying Party will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and
periodically for the reasonable costs of defending against the Third Party
Claim (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) if the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnity hereunder due to the facts on which such claim
is based. Regardless of the party who defends against such Third Party Claim,
the other party agrees to cooperate in good faith with the defending party,
and the defending party agrees to consult with the other party, and provide
any information relevant to the defense against the Third Party Claim, upon
request by the other party.

  

### 

  

(c) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim against any
Indemnifying Party hereunder due to a loss that does not involve a Third
Party Claim being asserted against or sought to be collected from such
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party will deliver notice of such claim
promptly to the Indemnifying Party, describing in reasonable detail the facts
giving rise to any claim for indemnification hereunder, the amount or method
of computation of the amount of such claim and such other information with
respect thereto as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The failure
to provide such notice, however, will not release the Indemnifying Party from
any of its obligations under this _Article VIII_ except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. The Indemnified Party
will reasonably cooperate and assist the Indemnifying Party in determining
the validity of any claim for indemnity by the Indemnified Party and in
otherwise resolving such matters. Such assistance and cooperation will
include providing reasonable access to and copies of information and records
and documents relating to such matters, furnishing (without cost) employees
to assist in the investigation, defense, and resolution of such matters and
providing business assistance with respect to such matters.

  



        
   

  



  

(d) No Indemnifying Party may settle, compromise, or discharge (i) a Third
Party Claim for injunctive relief without the Indemnified Partys written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed, or
conditioned), or (ii) any other Third Party Claim without the Indemnified
Partys written consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned) unless the Indemnifying Party has agreed that it is
fully liable to the Indemnified Party for the full amount of the settlement,
compromise, or discharge.

  



  

(e) Anything in this _Section 8.4_ to the contrary notwithstanding,
Representative will act for and on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties
or the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any notices to and from,
and any decisions, determinations, or directives to be made by, any one or
more Seller Indemnifying Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties under this
_Section 8.4_, and all such notices, decisions, determinations, and
directives will be given to and made by Representative acting on behalf of
the Seller Indemnifying Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties.

  



  

(f) In the event any Seller Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to _Article VIII_ for a claim for which
recovery is not limited to the Indemnity Escrow Amount, Buyer Indemnified
Parties will obtain such indemnification, first, by means of payment from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, and second, to the
extent such liability exceeds the applicable amount then remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund, pursuant to the indemnification procedures set forth
in this _Article VIII_.

  



  

Section 8.5 _Limits on Indemnification; Buyer Recovery from Escrow_.

  



  

(a) No claim may be asserted against any party for breach of any
representation, warranty, or covenant contained herein, unless written notice
of such claim is received by such party, describing in reasonable detail the
facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such claim on
or prior to the date on which the representation, warranty, or covenant on
which such claim is based ceases to survive as set forth in _Section
8.1_, in which case such representation, warranty, or covenant will survive
as to such claim until such claim has been finally resolved.

  



  

(b) (i) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Section 8.5_: (A)
the Seller Indemnifying Parties will not be liable to any Buyer Indemnified
Party for any claim for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ unless
and until the aggregate amount of indemnifiable Losses that must be incurred
before such Losses may be recovered from the Seller Indemnifying Parties
equals or exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price (before any Purchase Price
adjustment pursuant to _Section 2.4_); _provided, however_ , that in the
event the indemnifiable Losses equal or exceed the Sellers Basket (prior to
any downward adjustment thereof as hereinafter provided for), the aggregate
amount of indemnifiable Losses that may be recovered from the
Seller Indemnifying Parties will be adjusted so that the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may recover all Losses in excess of $600,000, (such 1%, as the same
may be adjusted to $600,000, the " _Sellers  Basket_"), and the Seller
Indemnifying Parties will be liable for all indemnifiable Losses based on
indemnification claims properly asserted against them that exceed in the
aggregate the Sellers Basket, but subject to the Per Item Basket set forth
below and subject to _Section 8.5(b)(i)(B)_;  _provided further_ , that the
Sellers Basket will not apply to Losses resulting from a breach of any Title
and Authorization Warranties or any representations set forth in the

  



        
   

  



  

Ancillary Agreements, (B) the maximum aggregate amount of
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to _Section 8.2_ _plus_  indemnifiable
amounts pursuant to _Section 6.2_ that may be recovered by the Buyer
Indemnified Parties will be an amount equal to the amount remaining in the
Indemnity Escrow Amount, recoverable under the Escrow Agreement, except ****
that (1) the Buyer Indemnified Parties recovery for Losses relating to a
breach by a Seller Indemnifying Party of any Core Representation as to itself
will not be based on recovery from the amount remaining in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, but instead will be limited to
recovery from or with respect to such Seller Indemnifying Party (and only
such Seller Indemnifying Party) of the remaining portion of his or its deemed
account in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (as contemplated in the Escrow
Agreement), to be obtained as a disbursement from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
_plus_ an additional amount (to be obtained directly from such Seller
Indemnifying Party) which equals such Seller Indemnifying Partys
Proportionate Share of the Adjusted Purchase Price, and (2) the Buyer
Indemnified Parties recovery for Losses relating to a breach by a Seller
Indemnifying Party of any representation as to itself (other than a Core
Representation) or a covenant to be performed by him or it will be limited to
his deemed account of the Indemnity Escrow Fund (as contemplated by the
Escrow Agreement), and (C) the Seller Indemnifying Parties will not be
obligated to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss
with respect to a matter (A) specifically identified in any Financial
Statements or Interim Financial Statements, or (B) for which there is a
reserve or accrual intended to cover such matter in the Closing Balance Sheet
(but only up to the amount of such reserve or accrual not otherwise relieved
by other matters).

  



  

(ii) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Seller
Indemnifying Parties will have no obligation to provide indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ (other than with respect to any breach of any
Title and Authorization Warranty) with respect to any individual claim or
series of related claims for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnified Parties
unless the amount of indemnification to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
will have become entitled with respect to such individual claim or series of
related claims for indemnification exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per Item Basket_
"). All such individual claims (including as an individual claim a series of
related claims arising out of the same facts and circumstances) in amounts
that exceed the Per Item Basket will be applied against the Sellers Basket,
and if and when such Sellers Basket is exceeded, the Seller Indemnifying
Parties will be obligated, subject to the other provisions of this _Article
VIII_, including _Section 8.5(b)(i)_, to provide indemnification with
respect to the full amount of any such individual claim that exceeds the Per
Item Basket.

  

 ** **

  

(iii) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, neither the
Seller Indemnifying Parties nor the Buyer Indemnifying Party will be liable
to the other parties hereto, any Buyer Indemnified Party or any Seller
Indemnified Party, as applicable, on account of any indemnity obligation set
forth in this _Article VIII_ or _Article VI_ for any indirect,
consequential, special, incidental, or punitive damages. For purposes
of this _Article VIII_ and _Article VI_, any damages actually paid by any
Seller Indemnified Party or Buyer Indemnified Party will be considered direct
damages rather than indirect, consequential, special, incidental, or punitive
damages.

  



  

(c) For all purposes of this _Article VIII_, Losses will be net of (i) any
insurance or other recoveries payable to the Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the facts

  



        
   

  



  

giving rise to the right of indemnification, and (ii) a reasonable estimate
of any Tax benefit available to such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
arising in connection with the accrual, incurrence, or payment of any such
Losses (including a reasonable estimate of the net present value of any Tax
benefit arising in subsequent taxable years). For purposes of Section
8.5(b)(i) above, such insurance or other recoveries, and such Tax benefit,
will be taken into account, and therefore will be deemed to reduce the
applicable Losses, so that in determining whether applicable Losses equal or
exceed the Sellers Basket, all such Losses will be net of such insurance or
other recoveries and such Tax benefits.

  



  

(d) The Buyer Indemnified Parties and the Seller Indemnified Parties will
cooperate with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability
with respect to which one or more Persons is obligated to indemnify one or
more others hereunder, including by making commercially reasonably efforts to
mitigate or resolve any such claim or liability; _provided_ , that the
failure by any Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties to
make such commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any claim or
liability will not affect the parties indemnification obligations hereunder.

  



  

(e) Anything in this _Section 8.5_ to the contrary notwithstanding,
Representative will act for and on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties
or the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any notices to and from,
and any decisions, determinations, or directives to be made by, any one or
more Seller Indemnifying Parties or Seller Indemnified Parties under this
_Section 8.5_ and _Article VI_, and all such notices, decisions,
determinations, and directives will be given to and made by Representative
acting on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties or the Seller Indemnified
Parties.

  



  

(f) Anything in this _Article VIII_ to the contrary notwithstanding, in the
event of any breach of a representation or warranty by a party that
constitutes knowing and intentional fraud, such partys liability for breach
of such representation or warranty will survive the Closing and continue
until expiration of the statute of limitations for such knowing and
intentional fraud, and the injured partys ability to recover Losses relating
thereto will not be limited to the Indemnity Escrow Amount and will not be
subject to any cap, the Sellers Basket, or Per Item Basket, whether imposed
by _Section 8.5(b) _or otherwise.

  



  

Section 8.6 _Assignment of Claims_. If any Buyer Indemnified Party receives
any payment from the Seller Indemnifying Parties in respect of any Losses
pursuant to _Section 8.2_ and the Buyer Indemnified Party could have
recovered all or a part of such Losses from a third party (a " _Potential
Contributor_ ") based on the underlying claim asserted against the Seller
Indemnifying Parties, the Buyer Indemnified Party will assign, on a non-
recourse basis and without any representation or warranty, such of its rights
to proceed against the Potential Contributor as are necessary to permit the
Seller Indemnifying Parties (or Representative acting on their behalf) to
recover from the Potential Contributor the amount of such payment.  Any
payment received in respect of such claim will be distributed, (i) first to
the Buyer Indemnified Party in the amount of any deductible or similar amount
required to be paid by the Buyer Indemnified Party prior to the
Seller Indemnifying Parties being required to make any payment to the
Buyer Indemnified Party, (ii) second to the Seller Indemnifying Parties in
an amount equal to the aggregate payments made by the Seller Indemnifying
Parties to the Buyer Indemnified Party in respect of such claim, plus costs
and expenses incurred in investigating, defending or

  



         
 

  

otherwise incurred in connection with addressing such claim, and (iii)
the balance, if any, to the Buyer Indemnified Party. Any assignments or
payments to be made to or for the benefit of the Seller Indemnifying Parties
under this _Section 8.6_ will be made to or at the direction of
Representative, acting on behalf of the Seller Indemnifying Parties.

  



  

Section 8.7 _Exclusivity_. Except as specifically set forth in this _Article
VIII_ and _Article VI_, effective as of Closing, Buyer, on behalf of
itself and the other Buyer Indemnified Parties, waives any rights and claims
any Buyer Indemnified Party may have against the Seller Indemnifying Parties
or any of them, whether in law or equity, relating to the Sellers, the
Company or its Subsidiaries, or Representative and/or the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements; _provided,
however_ , that the foregoing will not prohibit any party hereto from seeking
specific performance or other equitable relief with respect to its rights
under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements. The rights and claims
waived by the Buyer Indemnified Parties include claims for contribution or
other rights of recovery arising out of or relating to any Environmental
Laws, claims for breach of contract, breach of representation or warranty,
breach of implied covenants, negligent misrepresentation, and all other
claims for breach of duty. After Closing, subject to the foregoing, _Article
VIII_ and _Article VI_ will provide the exclusive remedy against the Seller
Indemnifying Parties for any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or other claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement and/or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

Section 8.8 _Investigation by Buyer; Disclaimer of Implied Warranties; No
Representations as to Projections_.

  



  

(a) Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has conducted its own
independent review, investigation, and analysis of the business, operations,
assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition, and
prospects of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) has been provided access
to personnel, properties, premises, and records of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for such purpose, and (iii) has relied in entering into this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements upon (x) its own review,
investigation, and analysis, and (y) the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

(b) It is the explicit intent and understanding of each party hereto that,
except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, no party hereto nor any
party to an Ancillary Agreement nor any Affiliates or agents or
representatives of any of the foregoing are making any representation or
warranty whatsoever, oral or written, express or implied, as to the accuracy
or completeness of any information regarding itself or themselves or the
Company or its Subsidiaries, including as to (i) merchantability or fitness
for any particular use or purpose, (ii) the use of the assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries or the operation of their business post-Closing, (iii)
the probable success or profitability of the Company or its Subsidiaries
post-Closing , or (iv) the ownership, use, or operation of the businesses of
the Company or its Subsidiaries post-Closing. No party hereto is relying on
any statement, representation, or warranty, oral or written, express
or implied, made by any other party hereto or any party to an Ancillary
Agreement or the Affiliates, agents, or representatives of any of the
foregoing, except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth
in this Agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

(c) In connection with Buyers investigation of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, Buyer may have received certain estimates, projections, and
other forecasts regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries. Buyer
acknowledges that there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such
estimates, projections, and other forecasts, that Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties, and that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its
own evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections,
and other forecasts that may have been furnished to it (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections, and
forecasts). Accordingly, neither the Sellers nor the Company make any
representation or warranty with respect to such estimates, projections, and
other forecasts (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying
such estimates, projections and forecasts); _provided,_ nothing in this
_Section 8.8(c) _is intended to restrict the representations set forth in
_Section 3.10_ insofar as the representations in _Section 3.10_ deal with
compliance with GAAP and such compliance may be based upon reasonable
projections and estimates.

  



  

Section 8.9 _Representative of Seller Indemnifying Parties_.

  



  

(a) Each Seller, on behalf of itself as a Seller Indemnifying Party, hereby
appoints Representative as agent and attorney-in-fact for each such Seller
Indemnifying Party for and on behalf of each such Seller Indemnifying Party
with full power and authority to represent each such Seller Indemnifying
Party and its heirs, successors, and assigns, with respect to all matters
arising under this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements (except such
Sellers Noncompetition Agreement, if applicable). All actions taken by
Representative under this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements will be
binding upon each Seller Indemnifying Party and its heirs, successors, and
assigns as if expressly ratified and confirmed in writing by each of them.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Representative will have
full power and authority, on behalf of each Seller Indemnifying Party and its
heirs, successors, and assigns, to interpret the terms and provisions of this
Agreement and such Ancillary Agreements, to dispute or fail to dispute any
claim under this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements, to negotiate and
compromise any dispute that may arise under this Agreement or such Ancillary
Agreements, to sign any release or other documents with respect to any such
dispute, and to give and receive notices hereunder and thereunder. A Seller
Indemnifying Party will be deemed a party or a signatory to any agreement,
document, instrument, or certificate for which Representative signs on behalf
of such Seller Indemnifying Party.

  



  

(b) Representative, in its capacity as such, will not be liable to Buyer or
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any act or failure to act under or in
connection with this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements, regardless of
whether any such act or failure to act by Representative constitutes
negligence, bad faith, or willful misconduct or is in breach of this
Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

(c) As set forth in the Representative Agreement, (i) Representative will
have no liability to any Seller Indemnified Parties under or in connection
with this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements (regardless of any
negligence, bad faith, willful misconduct, breach of this Agreement or such
Ancillary Agreements, or other type of action or omission by Representative),
(ii) Representative will be entitled to reimbursement for all costs and
expenses incurred by it while acting in such capacity, and any portion of the
Purchase Price, as the same may be adjusted hereunder, that otherwise would
be distributed to the Seller Indemnified Parties

  



        
   

  



  

may be deposited by Representative in an escrow for the purpose of satisfying
such costs and expenses, and (iii) the Seller Indemnified Parties will
indemnify and hold harmless Representative for all Losses suffered by
Representative acting in its capacity as such, regardless of whether
such Losses arise from or are related to actions or omissions of
Representative (whether constituting negligence, bad faith, or willful
misconduct or a breach of this Agreement or such Ancillary Agreements, or
other type of action or omission by Representative).

  



  

(d) The limitation of liability and indemnity provisions of _Section 8.9(b)
_and _Section 8.9(c) _will survive the termination of this Agreement and the
resignation of Representative.

  



  

(e) Representative may resign at any time in accordance with Section 10 of
the Representative Agreement.

perform (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 7.2_, (B) cannot be or has not been cured within 15 days following
delivery of written notice of such breach or failure to perform, and (C) has
not been waived by Representative, or (ii) by Buyer, if the Sellers or the

Ancillary Agreement and such breach or failure to perform (x) would give rise
to the failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.3_, (y) cannot be or

condition to be satisfied on or prior to such date;

  



  

(d) by either (i) Representative, or (ii) Buyer if Closing will not have
occurred by March 31, 2008 (the " _Termination Date_ "); or

or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
such order, decree, ruling, or other action will have become final and
nonappealable.

  



  

The party seeking to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
9.1_ will give prompt written notice of such termination to the other
parties.

hereunder. Any agreement on the part of any party or beneficiary to any such

 **ESCROW AGREEMENT**

  

 ** **

  

 ** **

  

This ESCROW AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_ "), is entered into as of 
, 2007, among United Stationers Supply Co., an Illinois corporation (the "
_Buyer_ "), the shareholders, optionholders, and warrantholders of ORS Nasco
Holding, Inc., a Delaware corporation (such shareholders, optionholders, and
warrantholders being referred to as the " _Sellers_ " and such corporation
being referred to as the " _Company_ "), Brazos Equity GP II, LLC, a Texas
limited liability company, as representative of the Sellers and other Persons
contemplated thereunder (the " _Representative_ "), and Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., a national banking association, as escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_
"). Capitalized terms used herein but not otherwise defined have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

# **RECITALS**

  

# ** **

  

WHEREAS, a Stock Purchase Agreement dated November 14, 2007 (the " _Purchase
Agreement_ ") has been executed by and among Buyer, the Company, the Sellers,
and Representative, pursuant to which, among other things, Buyer has agreed
to pay into escrow under this Agreement the following sums: (i) $15,000,000
(the " _Indemnity Escrow Amount_ "), and (ii) $1,500,000 (the "
_Working Capital Escrow Amount_ "), and the Sellers have agreed to pay into
the Indemnity Escrow Fund (as defined herein) to the extent required by
Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement, all to be disbursed as provided in
this Agreement, and

  



  

WHEREAS, the parties hereto desire the Escrow Agent to act as Escrow Agent
with respect to the Escrow Funds (as hereinafter defined), and the Escrow
Agent has agreed so to act.

  



  

# **AGREEMENT**

  

# ** **

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound hereby,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# **GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  

# ** **

  

1. _Appointment_.  The Escrow Agent is hereby appointed as Escrow Agent to hold and distribute the Escrow Funds in accordance with the terms hereof, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act in such capacity in accordance with the terms hereof.

  



  

2. _Creation of Escrow Accounts_. Pursuant to the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, on the Closing Date, Buyer will deposit with the Escrow Agent, and the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to accept in its capacity as such, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount. As used herein, " _Indemnity Escrow Fund_ " and " _Working Capital Escrow Fund_ " mean, respectively, the Indemnity Escrow Amount and the Working Capital Escrow Amount, together with all net income or net gain resulting from investments of such amount that has not previously been disbursed, and as such amount may be increased or 

        
   

  



  

decreased as provided herein and as provided in Section 2.4 of the Purchase
Agreement (the Indemnity Escrow Fund and the Working Capital Escrow Fund,
collectively, the " _Escrow Funds_ ," and individually, an " _Escrow Fund_
").

  



  

# **Indemnity Escrow Fund**

  

# ** **

  

3. _Disbursements from the Indemnity Escrow Fund for Losses, Maintenance of Accounts, and Final Distribution_.

  



  

### a. On each occasion on which Buyer determines in good faith that the
Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to payment of a claim (a " _Claim_ "):
(i) for indemnification pursuant to Article VI or Article VIII of the
Purchase Agreement after following the procedures set forth in Sections 6.2
or 8.4 of the Purchase Agreement, as applicable, and subject to the limits
set forth in Article VI and Article VIII of the Purchase Agreement, as
applicable, or (ii) for a Purchase Price Deficiency, after following the
procedures set forth in Section 2.4 of the Purchase Agreement, and subject to
the limits set forth in Section 2.4 and Article VIII of the Purchase
Agreement, then Buyer and/or Representative, as applicable, may deliver to
the Escrow Agent and Representative a written request for the payment of such
amount (a " _Claim Notice_ "), which request will identify in reasonable
detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the subject matter of such
Claim, the amount or method of computing the amount of the Losses, and such
other information as Representative may reasonably request.

  

### 

  

### b. If, (i) within 30 days after Buyers delivery of a Claim Notice to
both the Escrow Agent and Representative pursuant to _Section 3(a)_,
Representative does not notify the Escrow Agent and Buyer in writing that
Representative objects in good faith to a Claim that Representative has not
signed (a " _Claim Objection_ "), which objection will identify in reasonable
detail the reasons for the objection, or (ii) a Claim Notice is delivered
jointly by Buyer and Representative, the Escrow Agent will promptly disburse
amounts from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to Buyer in the amount requested in
such Claim Notice.

  

### 

  

### c. If within 30 days after Buyers delivery of a Claim Notice pursuant to
_Section 3(a)_, Representative delivers to the Escrow Agent and Buyer a
Claim Objection, the Escrow Agent will not disburse the amount requested in
the Claim Notice, or the disputed portion thereof, as the case may be,
pending either: (i) receipt by the Escrow Agent of joint written instructions
from Buyer and Representative specifying the agreement of the parties as to
the action to be taken with respect to such Claim (" _Indemnity Payment
Instructions_ "), or (ii) receipt by the Escrow Agent of a notice from Buyer
or Representative stating that such dispute has been submitted to a court of
competent jurisdiction or to binding arbitration for judgment, and that a
final judgment or arbitral decision with respect to such matters has been
rendered, which notice will be accompanied by a copy of a final, non-
appealable order of the court or binding arbitral award pursuant to which
such court or arbitral body has determined whether and to what extent Buyer
is entitled to the amount requested in such Claim Notice, and a statement by
the submitting party that such decision is final and non-appealable (such
notice, decision, or statement, as applicable, an " _Indemnity Determination
Order_ "). A copy of any Indemnity Determination Order will also be sent by
Buyer or Representative, as the case may be, to the other party concurrently
with the delivery thereof to the Escrow Agent. If, within 15 days after the
submitting partys delivery of an Indemnity Determination Order, the other
party does

  



        
   

  



  

### not notify the Escrow Agent in writing (with a copy to the submitting
party) that it has grounds for challenging the Indemnity Determination Order,
which notice will identify in reasonable detail the basis for the challenge,
the Escrow Agent will act in accordance with _Section 3(d)_.

  

### 

  

### d. If the Escrow Agent has received Indemnity Payment Instructions or an
Indemnity Determination Order (and, with respect to an Indemnity
Determination Order, the designated period for challenge thereof as referred
to in _Section 3(c) _has lapsed), and if such Indemnity Payment Instructions
or Indemnity Determination Order indicate that Buyer is entitled to payment
in respect of all or any portion of a Claim, then the Escrow Agent will
promptly disburse from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to Buyer (acting for itself
or other Buyer Indemnified Parties, as applicable) amounts due to Buyer as
indicated in such Indemnity Payment Instructions or Indemnity Determination
Order. If such Indemnity Payment Instructions or Indemnity Determination
Order indicate that Buyer is not entitled to all or any portion of the amount
of the Claim, then the Escrow Agent will hold the amount to which Buyer is
not entitled in accordance with the terms of this Agreement until such
amounts are to be disbursed: (i) pursuant to _Section 3(f)_, (ii) to Buyer
in respect of another Claim pursuant to this _Section 3_, or (iii) upon the
receipt of joint written instructions from Buyer and Representative.

  

### 

  

### e. For purposes of the Indemnity Escrow Fund, each Seller will be deemed
to own initially a portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund equal to the portion
of the total amount contributed with respect to him or it to the Indemnity
Escrow Fund.  Each Seller will be deemed to own an account in the Indemnity
Escrow Fund equal to the portion of Indemnity Escrow Fund owned by such
Seller either initially or from time to time thereafter.  If it is
determined in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and this _Section
3_ that the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to payment from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund for a Claim brought with regard to any Sellers breach
of a representation or warranty contained in Part A of Article III of
the Purchase Agreement, or any Sellers breach of a covenant under the
Purchase Agreement, or any Sellers breach of a representation, warranty,
covenant, or obligation as to itself contained in any Ancillary Agreement,
then the Escrow Agent will be deemed to have drawn the funds to be paid to
the Buyer Indemnified Parties for such Loss only from the account of such
breaching Seller Indemnifying Party, and such breaching Seller Indemnifying
Partys account will be deemed diminished by such amount. If it is determined
in accordance with the Purchase Agreement and this _Section 3_ that the
Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to payment for any other Claim, then
the Escrow Agent will be deemed to have drawn the funds for such claim from
the account of each Seller proportionately according to his or its initial
contributions to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and each such account will be
deemed diminished by such proportionate amount. If there are not sufficient
funds in the account of a Seller to pay its pro rata share in accordance with
the preceding sentence, then the Escrow Agent will be deemed to have drawn
the shortfall from the accounts of the remaining Sellers proportionately
according to their initial contributions to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and
each such account will be deemed diminished accordingly, and Representative
will be entitled to recover from the Seller whose account was deficient in
order to reimburse the other Sellers in accordance with the Representative
Agreement.

  

### 

  

### f. At the date that is six months from the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent
will pay and distribute any and all of the then outstanding amount of the
Indemnity Escrow Fund in excess of $8,000,000 according to instructions from
Representative, unless any Claims theretofore made are then still pending and
unresolved, in which case assets representing an

  



        
   

  



  

### amount equal to but not exceeding the amounts of such Claims, _plus_
 $8,000,000, will be retained by the Escrow Agent (the " _Retained Amount_
"). At the date that is 30 days after completion of the audited financial
statements of the Company and its Subsidiaries for 2008 (but in no event
later than April 30, 2009), the Escrow Agent will pay and distribute any and
all of the then outstanding amount of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in excess of
$4,000,000 according to instructions from Representative, unless any Claims
theretofore made are then still pending and unresolved, in which case assets
representing an amount equal to but not exceeding the amounts of such Claims,
_plus_  $4,000,000, will be the Retained Amount.  At the date that is two
years from the Closing Date, if any Claims theretofore made are then still
pending and unresolved, then assets representing an amount equal to but not
exceeding the amounts of such Claims will be the Retained Amount, and the
balance will be paid according to instructions from Representative.
The Escrow Agent will thereafter release from the Indemnity Escrow Fund to
the party entitled thereto all or a portion of the Retained Amount according
to instructions from such party as and when the Escrow Agent receives
Indemnity Payment Instructions or an Indemnity Determination Order (and, with
respect to an Indemnity Determination Order, the designated period for
challenge thereof as referred to in _Section 3(c) _has lapsed), as
applicable, relating to certain or all such Claims.

4. _Disbursement from Working Capital Escrow Fund Upon Final Determination of Purchase Price and Final Disbursement_. The Escrow Agent will hold amounts in the Working Capital Escrow Fund pending either: (i) receipt by the Escrow Agent of joint written instruction from Buyer and Representative specifying the agreement of the parties with respect to payments from the Working Capital Escrow Fund following adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to the Purchase Agreement (the " _Purchase Price Payment Instructions_ "), or (ii) receipt by the Escrow Agent of a notice from Buyer or Representative stating that the Purchase Price adjustment has been submitted to binding arbitration by the Reviewing Accountant and that a final determination with respect to such matters has been rendered, which notice will be accompanied by a copy of the decision of the Reviewing Accountant specifying the amount to be paid to Buyer or Representative, as the case may be, with regard to the Purchase Price adjustment, and a statement by the submitting party that such decision is final and non-appealable (such notice, decision, and statement collectively, a " _Purchase Price Determination Order_ "). A copy of such Purchase Price Determination Order will also be sent by Buyer or Representative, as the case may be, to the other party concurrently with the delivery thereof to the Escrow Agent.  If, within 15 days after the submitting partys delivery of a Purchase Price Determination Order, the other party does not notify the Escrow Agent in writing (with a copy to the submitting party) that it has grounds for challenging the Purchase Price Determination Order, which notice will identify in reasonable detail the basis for the challenge: (i) if there is a Purchase Price Surplus, the Escrow Agent will pay all amounts in the Working Capital Escrow Fund as directed by Representative, and (ii) if there is a Purchase Price Deficiency, the Escrow Agent will pay to Buyer the amount of the Purchase Price Deficiency from the Working Capital Escrow Fund (and, if applicable, from the Indemnity Escrow Fund as provided in _Section 3_ above), and distribute the remaining amount of the Working Capital Escrow Fund, if any, as directed by Representative.

  



        
   

  



  

5. _Accounts in the Working Capital Escrow Fund_. For purposes of the Working Capital Escrow Fund, each Seller will be deemed to own initially a portion of the Working Capital Escrow Fund equal to the portion of the total amount contributed with respect to him or it to the Working Capital Escrow Fund. Each Seller will be deemed to own an account in the Working Capital Escrow Fund equal to portion of the Working Capital Escrow Fund owned by such Seller either initially or at any time thereafter. If it is determined pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and _Section 4_ immediately above that Buyer is entitled to payment from the Working Capital Escrow Fund, then the Escrow Agent will be deemed to have drawn the funds for such payment from the account of each Seller proportionately according to the initial contributions with respect to each of them to the Working Capital Escrow Fund, and each account will be deemed diminished by such proportionate amount.

6. _Duties of the Escrow Agent_.

  



  

a. The Escrow Agent will (i) keep all cash and investments in each Escrow
Fund in one or more accounts conspicuously marked on the records of the
Escrow Agent, as "Indemnity Escrow Fund for the benefit of United Stationers
Supply Co. and Brazos Equity GP II, LLC, as agent," "Working Capital Escrow
Fund for the benefit of United Stationers Supply Co. and Brazos Equity GP II,
LLC, as agent," as applicable, together with the account numbers thereof, and
(ii) give such further assurances as Buyer and Representative may reasonably
request in order to ensure that the Escrow Agent is in compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

b. The duties of the Escrow Agent hereunder are only such as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement, such duties being purely ministerial in nature,
and no other duties or obligations will be read into this Agreement against
the Escrow Agent.  The Escrow Agent will not be responsible for any other
agreement referred to herein, or for determining or compelling compliance
therewith, and will not otherwise be bound thereby. IN NO EVENT WILL THE
ESCROW AGENT BE LIABLE, DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, FOR ANY SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL LOSSES OR DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), EVEN IF THE ESCROW AGENT HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES OR DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION.

  



  

c. The Escrow Agent will be entitled to rely upon any order, judgment,
certification, demand, notice, instrument, or other writing delivered to the
Escrow Agent hereunder without being required to determine the authenticity
or the correctness of any fact stated therein or the propriety or validity
thereof. The Escrow Agent may act in reliance upon any instrument or
signature believed in good faith by the Escrow Agent to be genuine and may
assume in good faith that any person purporting to give receipt or advice or
make any statement or execute any document in connection with the provisions
hereof has been duly authorized to do so.

  



        
   

  



  

d. The Escrow Agent may act pursuant to the advice of counsel of its own
choice with respect to any matter relating to this Agreement and will not be
liable and will have full and complete authorization and protection for any
action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with
such written advice.

  



  

e. In the event of any disagreement between Buyer and Representative
resulting in adverse claims or demands being made in connection with any
portion of the Escrow Funds, or in the event that the Escrow Agent in good
faith is in doubt as to what action the Escrow Agent should take
hereunder with respect to any portion of the Escrow Funds, the Escrow Agent
will retain such portion of the Indemnity Escrow Fund or the Working Capital
Escrow Fund, as applicable, until the Escrow Agent will have received
Purchase Price Payment Instructions, a Purchase Price Determination Order,
Indemnity Payment Instructions, or an Indemnity Determination Order, as
applicable, directing delivery of any Escrow Funds (and with respect to a
Purchase Price Determination Order or an Indemnity Determination Order, the
designated period for challenge thereof as referred to herein has lapsed), in
which event the Escrow Agent will disburse the Escrow Funds in accordance
therewith. The Escrow Agent will have the option, after 30 days written
notice to the other parties of its intention to do so, to file an action in
interpleader requiring the parties to answer and litigate any claims and
rights among themselves.

  



  

7. _Resignation and Removal of the Escrow Agent_. The Escrow Agent, and any successor Escrow Agent, may resign at any time as Escrow Agent hereunder by giving at least 60 days prior written notice to Buyer and Representative. Upon such resignation and the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent, the obligations and duties of the resigning Escrow Agent will terminate. Upon their receipt of notice of resignation from the Escrow Agent, Buyer and Representative will use reasonable efforts jointly to designate a successor Escrow Agent. In the event Buyer and Representative do not agree upon a successor Escrow Agent within 60 days after the receipt of such notice, the Escrow Agent so resigning may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent or other appropriate relief and any such resulting appointment will be binding upon the parties hereto. The Escrow Agent may be removed, with or without cause, by 10 days written notice to the Escrow Agent from both Buyer and Representative. The Escrow Agent or successor Escrow Agent will continue to act as Escrow Agent until a successor is appointed and qualified to act as Escrow Agent in accordance with this _Section 7_.

  



  

8. _Compensation_.  The Escrow Agent will receive as compensation for the performance of its duties as such hereunder an annual administrative fee as set forth on _Exhibit A_, together with reimbursement for all reasonable expenses, disbursements, and advances incurred or made by the Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder (including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel), _provided_ , that no such payments will be made out of the Escrow Funds other than as specifically set forth in the second to last sentence of this _Section 8_.  The Escrow Agent will receive reimbursement upon written request to Buyer and Representative, who will each pay a portion of such expenses in the same proportion as each pays a portion of the annual administrative fee. The Escrow Agent will have, and is hereby granted, a prior lien upon any Escrow Funds that are to be disbursed to Buyer or Representative with respect to such partys share of the Escrow Agents unpaid fees, non-reimbursed expenses, and unsatisfied indemnification rights, superior to the interests of any other persons or entities.

  



        
   

  



  

The Escrow Agent will be entitled and is hereby granted the right to set off
and deduct from any amount that is to be distributed to Buyer or
Representative in accordance with this Agreement any unpaid fees, non-
reimbursed expenses, and unsatisfied indemnification rights.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer and Representative will be jointly and
severally liable for all amounts payable to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this
_Section 8_.

  



  

9. _Instructions_.  Buyer and Representative will each execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent a certificate of incumbency in substantially the form of _Exhibit A_ for the purpose of establishing the identity of the representatives of Buyer and Representative entitled to issue instructions or directions to the Escrow Agent on behalf of each such party. In the event of any change in the identity of such representatives, a new certificate of incumbency will be executed and delivered to the Escrow Agent by the appropriate party. Until such time as the Escrow Agent will receive a new incumbency certificate, the Escrow Agent will be fully protected in relying without inquiry on any then current incumbency certificate on file with the Escrow Agent.

  



  

10. _Indemnification_.  Buyer and Representative will jointly and severally indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Escrow Agent from and against all losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) that the Escrow Agent may incur by reason of its acting as Escrow Agent under this Agreement, except to the extent such loss, liability, damage, cost, or expense is finally determined to have been caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent. The obligations of Buyer and Representative under this _Section 10_ will survive the termination of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Escrow Agent.

  



  

11. _Escrow Agent to Provide Status of Accounts_. Upon request of Representative or Buyer with respect to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and at the time of any distribution from the Indemnity Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent will provide written confirmation to Buyer and Representative of the amount in each account within the Indemnity Escrow Fund as of the time of the request or distribution, and the portion of such amount in each account which represents earnings from the investment of monies in the Indemnity Escrow Fund.

  



  

12. _Contribution_.  If at any time either Buyer or Representative has paid the Escrow Agent more than 50% of the Aggregate Escrow Agent Payments (as defined below), then such party (the " _Excess Payor_ ") will be entitled to contribution from the other party (the " _Under Payor_ ") for an amount (the " _Contribution Amount_ ") equal to the amount by which the Excess Payors payments to the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Sections 8_ and _10_ , as of such time and after giving effect to any Contribution Amounts previously received by the Excess Payor from the Under Payor, exceed 50% of the Aggregate Escrow Agent Payments. " _Aggregate Escrow Agent Payments_ " means, as of any date, the aggregate amount of all payments made by Buyer and Representative to the Escrow Agent pursuant to _Sections 8_ and _10_. The Excess Payor may deliver to the Under Payor a written demand for such contribution at any time, and upon receipt of such demand the Under Payor will immediately pay the other party the Contribution Amount.

  



        
   

  



  

 **Miscellaneous**

  



  

13. _Compliance with Procedures_. In the event any party fails to comply with the procedures set forth in the Purchase Agreement, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties or Seller Indemnifying Parties, as applicable, will have all rights, defenses, and remedies provided for in the Purchase Agreement relating to such failure to comply notwithstanding the terms and provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

14. _Termination_. This Agreement will terminate on the date on which the entire amount in the Indemnity Escrow Fund and Working Capital Escrow Fund will have been disbursed in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

15. _Distribution by Representative_. Any monies distributed for the benefit of the Sellers will be distributed by the Escrow Agent according to instructions from Representative. In the event Representative receives any monies from an Escrow Fund, then Representative will distribute such funds to the Sellers according to the amounts in their accounts in such Escrow Fund, subject to the provisions of Representative Agreement, and subject to any reimbursement due to any Seller as provided in the last sentence of _Section 3(e)_. Any such funds received by Representative will be received by Representative only in its capacity as agent for the Sellers and, for income tax purposes, such funds will be deemed received by the Sellers according to the amounts in their accounts in such Escrow Fund.

  



  

16. _Investments_. Upon joint written instructions from Buyer and Representative, the Escrow Agent will invest and reinvest any cash in each Escrow Fund in any one of the following investments: (a) direct obligations of or obligations guaranteed by the United States of America, (b) repurchase agreements collateralized by investments in clause (a) above, (c) commercial paper rated A-1 or better by Standard and Poors Corporation or Prime-1 by Moodys Investors Services, Inc., (d) certificates of deposit issued by commercial banks of the United States having assets in excess of $500,000,000, or (e) such other investments as may be mutually agreed upon by Buyer and Representative (" _Permitted Investments_ "), _provided_ , that in any case, any investments will be with such maturities as Buyer and Representative may determine are compatible with the payments which may be required from the applicable Escrow Fund hereunder. In the event that the Escrow Agent does not receive directions to invest funds held in an Escrow Fund, such funds will remain uninvested. The Escrow Agent acknowledges that it has no interest in any cash or investments held in the Escrow Funds from time to time, and further acknowledges that the Escrow Funds are to be held for the benefit of Buyer (for itself and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnified Parties) and Representative (as agent for the Sellers). The Escrow Agent will have no responsibility or liability for any diminution in value of any assets held hereunder which may result from any investments or reinvestments made in accordance with any provision hereof. Income earned by an Escrow Fund will accrue and become part of such Escrow Fund. In connection with making any payment pursuant to this Agreement, the Escrow Agent will have the absolute right to sell or divest any Permitted Investments.

  



  

17. _Income and Taxes_.

  



  

a. All net income or net gain from investments of the Escrow Funds will, for
income tax purposes, be considered as income of the Sellers for income tax
purposes, and will be deemed deposited to their accounts in the Escrow Funds
from time to time.  The Escrow Agent will provide to Buyer and Representative
a monthly statement with respect to any earnings,

  



        
   

  



  

disbursements and losses during the period covered by the statement, and will
issue Forms 1099 to the Sellers with respect to income deemed earned by them,
to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
 The Escrow Agent will also provide such additional information
to Representative and/or Buyer as reasonably requested by either of them from
time to time.

  



  

b. Representative, Buyer, and each Seller will provide the Escrow Agent with
their respective taxpayer identification numbers and/or with any other
information reasonably requested by the Escrow Agent in connection with any
required reporting to any taxing authority. The parties acknowledge that the
failure to so provide such forms or information may prevent or delay
disbursements from the Escrow Funds and may also result in the assessment of
a penalty and the Escrow Agents being required to withhold tax on any
interest or other income earned on the Escrow Funds. Any payments of income
will be subject to applicable withholding regulations then in force in the
United States or any other jurisdiction, as applicable.

  



  

18. _Representative_. The Representative Agreement provides that Representative has the full power and authority to give and receive all notices, instructions, and directions, and make all decisions and otherwise act, on behalf of the Sellers under this Agreement.

  



  

19. _Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, or supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in writing signed by all of the parties affected by such amendment, modification, or change, and otherwise as expressly set forth herein, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement or the Representative Agreement.

  



  

20. _Waiver_. No failure or delay of any party in exercising any right or remedy hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder. Any agreement on the part of any party to any such waiver will be valid only if set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by such party if an individual, and otherwise by a duly authorized officer on behalf of such party.

  



  

21. _Notices_. All notices and other communications hereunder will be in writing and will be deemed duly given: (a) on the date of delivery if delivered personally, or if by facsimile, upon written confirmation of receipt by facsimile or otherwise, (b) on the first Business Day following the date of dispatch if delivered utilizing a next-day service by a recognized next-day courier, or (c) on the earlier of confirmed receipt or the fifth Business Day following the date of mailing if delivered by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid.

 _W I T N E S S E T H_ :

  



  

WHEREAS, the Selling Stockholder has been actively involved in the business
of the Company, and/or a Subsidiary (as defined in _Section 1(a)_), as an
employee, officer, stockholder, optionholder, warrantholder, and/or member of
the Board of Directors of the Company and/or a Subsidiary, as applicable;

  



  

WHEREAS, United Stationers Supply Co., Inc., an Illinois corporation ("
_Buyer_ ") has agreed to purchase all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company (the " _Shares_ ") pursuant to a Stock Purchase
Agreement dated as of the date hereof, by and among Buyer, the Company, the
Selling Stockholder and others (the " _Purchase Agreement_ ");

  



  

WHEREAS, Buyer has agreed to pay for the cancellation of the Options and the
Warrants (as each such term is defined in _Section 4_);

  



  

WHEREAS, the Selling Stockholder is employed by the Company or a Subsidiary;

  



  

WHEREAS, the involvement by the Selling Stockholder in a business in
competition with the Company would diminish the value of the Shares to be
purchased by Buyer and the value to the Buyer associated with the
cancellation of the Options and the Warrants; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as an inducement to Buyer to consummate its purchase of the Shares
and payment of the cancellation of the Options and the Warrants, the Selling
Stockholder has agreed not to compete with the Company and to refrain from
making disclosures to the extent set forth below.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the covenants and
agreements contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# Section 1. _Nonsolicitation and Noncompetition_.  In consideration of
entering into the Purchase Agreement and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged
by the Selling Stockholder, including, but not limited to, the receipt of
that portion of the Purchase Price (as defined in the Purchase Agreement)
attributable to the payment of the Shares and/or the cancellation of the
Options and the Warrants, the Selling Stockholder agrees as follows:

  

#   

     
   

  

## 

  

## (a) Except with the prior written approval of the Board of Directors of
the Company (the " _Board_ "), during the Selling Stockholders employment
with the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable (the " _Employment Period_
"), and for two (2) years after the termination or expiration of the
Employment Period or during any time the Selling Stockholder is receiving
severance payments under a written employment agreement with the Company or a
Subsidiary, the Selling Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly (i)
solicit, persuade or induce any then current employee of the Company or any
of its direct or indirect subsidiaries (the " _Subsidiaries_ " and each, a "
_Subsidiary_ ") to terminate his or her employment with the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries or to become employed or otherwise engaged for compensation
by any party other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; (ii) approach
any such employee for any of the foregoing purposes; or (iii) cause or assist
in the taking of or knowingly authorize such actions by any third party;
provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 1(a) _shall prohibit the
placing of any advertisement of employment in any publication of general
circulation not specifically directed at such employees; and

  

## 

  

## (b) The Selling Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that the nature of his
responsibilities for the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and
of the confidential information and proprietary data to which he will receive
access during his employment with the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable,
will render it impossible for him to perform in a similar capacity for a
competitor, even in good faith, without utilizing and drawing upon such
confidential information and proprietary data. Accordingly, during the
Employment Period and for (A) two (2) years after the expiration of the
Employment Period or termination of the Selling Stockholders employment if
terminated by the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, for Cause (as
defined in _Section 4_) or by the Selling Stockholder without Good Reason

the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, without Cause, by the
Selling Stockholder with Good Reason, or due to the Selling Stockholders
Permanent Disability (as defined in _Section 4_), the Selling Stockholder
shall not, directly or indirectly, (w) engage in, (x) make any
financial investment in, (y) become employed by, or (z) render
consulting, advisory or other similar services to or for, in each case any
person or other business enterprise (other than Buyer, the Company, the
Subsidiaries and their affiliates) having or operating a business that is
engaged in wholesale distribution of industrial supplies for use in the
industrial, welding, oilfield, safety, electrical, construction,
heating/ventilation/air conditioning, maintenance/repair/ operations,
plumbing, janitorial/sanitation and rental markets, that competes with the
Company or any Subsidiary within any state in which the Company or any
Subsidiary conducts business (any of the foregoing activities being referred
to herein as " _Competitive Activities_ "). The foregoing covenant regarding
Competitive Activities shall not be construed to preclude the Selling
Stockholder from making any investments in the securities of any company,
whether or not engaged in competition with the Company or any Subsidiary, to
the extent that such securities are traded on a national securities exchange
or in the over-the-counter market in the United States or any foreign
securities exchange and such investment does

## 2   

     
   

  

## 

  

## not exceed five percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding shares of such
company or give the Selling Stockholder the right or power to control or
participate directly in making the policy decisions of such company.

  

## 

  

# Section 2. _Non-Disclosure_. During the Employment Period, the Selling
Stockholder will have access to and become acquainted with confidential
information and proprietary data of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
including but not limited to technical data, future business plans, customer

confidence and not directly or indirectly disclose, use, copy or make lists
of any such confidential information or proprietary data of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, except to the extent authorized in writing by the
Board or required by any court or administrative agency, other than to an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or a person to whom
disclosure is reasonably necessary or appropriate in connection with the
performance by the Selling Stockholder of his duties as an employee of the
Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable. Confidential information shall not
include any information known generally to the public. All records, files,
documents and materials, or copies thereof, relating to the Companys or any

Each Seller agrees to contribute to such reserve Proportionate Share, and also agrees to add to such reserve in the same proportion in the future by making payments upon notice from Representative and by hereby authorizing Representative to add monies to such reserve from any distributions from the Escrows that Representative either receives on behalf of any Seller or as directed by Representative.  Such reserve will be held by Representative to be drawn against as needed for payment under the Purchase Agreement or for reimbursement to Representative. Any Seller will be entitled to an accounting of distributions from such reserve upon written request. Representative may deposit such reserve into an interest-bearing account as it will choose, and any earnings will supplement the amount held in such reserve. Representative will not be 

  



        
   

  



  

responsible for any Losses resulting from the deposit to any such interest-
bearing account.  Any monies remaining in such reserve upon the termination
of this Agreement will be distributed to the Sellers in proportion to
their contributions to such reserve.

  



  

6. **Escrow**.  Each Seller agrees to the establishment of the Escrows under the Escrow Agreement to secure indemnification and working capital adjustment obligations under the Purchase Agreement, and covenants and agrees to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and each further agrees to all contributions to the Escrow Funds for such purposes and in such amounts as are provided in the Purchase Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, and any other Ancillary Agreement.

  



  

7. **Indemnification of Others, and Indemnification Outside of Escrow**.

  



  

a. Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that his or its indemnification
obligations under the Purchase Agreement cover certain breaches of
representations, warranties, and covenants made by the Company and
Representative, in addition to breaches of any representations, warranties,
and covenants made by such Seller as to itself in the Agreement and any
Ancillary Agreement or documents contemplated therein.

  



  

b. Each Seller also acknowledges and agrees that recovery due to Buyer
Indemnified Parties for certain breaches and indemnities is not limited to
the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and that each Seller Indemnifying Party may be
required to pay the recovery for such breaches and indemnities to
Buyer Indemnified Parties outside of the Indemnity Escrow Fund in that, in
the event there is a breach by a Seller of a Core Representation as to
itself, recovery for such Loss from the applicable Seller Indemnifying Party
is not limited to the Indemnity Escrow Fund, and Buyer Indemnified Parties
may request payment from and pursue actions against the applicable Seller
Indemnifying Party to recover from the remaining portion of his or its deemed
account in the Indemnity Escrow Fund (as contemplated in the Escrow
Agreement), to be obtained as a disbursement from the Indemnity Escrow Fund,
_plus_  an additional amount (to be obtained directly from such Seller
Indemnifying Party) that equals such Seller Indemnifying Partys
Proportionate Share of the Adjusted Purchase Price. Anything in this
Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, the Buyer Indemnified
Parties rights to recovery are subject to the limitations set forth in the
Purchase Agreement. Each Seller also acknowledges and agrees that recovery
due to Buyer Indemnified Parties for knowing and intentional fraud by any
party, including the Company and Representative, is not limited to the
Indemnity Escrow Fund or to any basket or cap on liability, as provided in
the Purchase Agreement.

  



  

c. Each Seller also acknowledges and agrees that a Sellers account in the
Indemnity Escrow Fund (as described in the Escrow Agreement) may become
depleted by reason of Losses for which only such Seller is liable. In the
event the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to a recovery from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund for Losses for which all Sellers are liable and there
are insufficient funds in the deemed accounts of one or more Sellers, then
the other Sellers may be required to pay more than their proportionate shares
of any recovery due to the Buyer Indemnified Parties from the deemed accounts
of such other Sellers in the Indemnity Escrow Fund. In that event, the
deficiency will be drawn from the accounts of the other Sellers
proportionately according to their initial contributions to the Indemnity
Escrow Fund, and each such account will be diminished accordingly. If
such deficiency is so satisfied in whole or in

  



        
   

  



  

part, then the deficient Seller whose account was depleted will be obligated
to promptly pay the amount of such deficiency to Representative upon notice
from Representative for reimbursement to the other Sellers. If such Seller
fails to satisfy such obligation within 30 days after the sending of such
notice, then the other Sellers, or Representative on their behalf, will be
entitled to pursue an action against such deficient Seller for its deficiency
and for costs of recovery. If any such deficiency is recovered from a
deficient Seller (after expenses of such recovery), then the funds so
recovered will be disbursed to the other Sellers who made up the deficiency
for the amounts they paid in excess of their original pro rata shares before
satisfying any part of the deficiency, subject to any adjustment
Representative may direct for costs and to reimburse any Sellers for payments
made as a result of any other deficiencies.

  



  

d. In the event there is a breach by a Seller of a representation or warranty
under Part A of Article III of the Purchase Agreement or in such partys
Ancillary Agreements, and the Buyer Indemnified Parties recover from the
Indemnity Escrow Fund for a Loss caused by such breach an amount that exceeds
what remains in such breaching Sellers or Indemnity Escrow Fund account,
then the breaching party will be liable to the other Sellers for their pro
rata share of the amount such Sellers paid in excess of what remained in the
breaching partys account, according to the initial contributions made to the
Indemnity Escrow Fund with respect to each such non-breaching Seller. The
breaching Seller will be obligated to promptly pay the amount of such
deficiency to Representative upon notice from Representative for
reimbursement to the other Sellers. In the event such breaching Seller fails
to promptly satisfy such obligation, then Representative will be entitled to
pursue an action against such breaching Seller for the amount such breaching
party should have paid, and for costs of recovery. In the event Representative
recovers any such funds, then, upon receipt of such funds, Representative
will disburse those funds to the other Sellers who paid more than their pro
rata share, as applicable, subject to any adjustment Representative may make
for costs of recovery to reimburse any Seller for any other such
disproportionate payments.

Each party agrees that the provisions of this Agreement will be binding upon the successors, assigns, heirs, and estates of each party, _provided_ , that anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this Agreement may not be assigned by any Seller without the written consent of Representative, in its sole discretion; _provided further_ , that Representative may assign its rights under this Agreement and/or under the Purchase Agreement without the consent of any other party hereto.  Representative, and any 

  



        
   

  



  

successor Representative, may resign at any time as Representative hereunder
by giving at least 60 days prior written notice to each Seller.
Upon Representatives resignation, Representative will appoint a
successor Representative; _provided, however_ , that Representative will
continue to act as Representative until a successor is appointed by
Representative and such successor Representative agrees in writing to be
subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Upon such resignation and the
appointment of a successor Representative, the obligations and duties of the
resigning Representative will terminate.

  



  

11. **Term**.  This Agreement, including the power of attorney granted hereby, will continue in full force and effect until the earlier of: (i) three months after the date when all representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities of the Sellers, Representative, and the Company under the Purchase Agreement will have terminated pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and all claims for indemnification from the Buyer Indemnified Parties thereunder will have been resolved, or (ii) Representative will have notified the Sellers that its services as Representative are no longer needed under or with respect to the Purchase Agreement, Escrow Agreement, and the other Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

12. **Entire Agreement**. This Agreement, the Purchase Agreement, and the Escrow Agreement constitute the entire agreement among the parties pertaining to the subject matter hereof.  No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement will be deemed, or will constitute, a waiver of any other provision, whether or not similar, nor will any waiver constitute a continuing waiver.  No waiver will be binding unless executed in writing by the party making the waiver.

  



  

13. **Amendment**.  No change, modification, or amendment of this Agreement will be valid or binding unless such change, modification, or amendment is in writing and duly executed by all of the parties affected by such change, modification, or amendment.

  



  

14. **Severability**. If a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any provision of this Agreement is not enforceable in whole or in part, this Agreement will continue in full force and effect with such provision stricken in whole or in part, as appropriate.

  



  

15. **Governing Law**. This Agreement will be governed by and construed, interpreted, and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to the principles of conflict of laws thereof).

  



  

16. **Waiver of Jury Trial**. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by way of motion or as a
defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby: (a)
any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-
named courts for any reason other than the failure lawfully to serve process,
(b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in any such court (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the
fullest extent permitted by law, that: (i) the suit, action, or proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue or forum
