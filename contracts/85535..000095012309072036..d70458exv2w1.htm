to be satisfied by it, as soon as practical and in any event before the
Effective Date, and to take, or cause to be taken, all other action and to do,
or cause to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to
permit the completion of the Transactions in accordance with the Arrangement,
this agreement, the agreements that it contemplates and applicable Law, and
to cooperate with each other in connection therewith (provided, however,
that, with respect to Canadian provincial or territorial
qualifications, neither Acquireco nor Canco shall be required to register or
qualify as a foreign corporation or to take any action that would subject it
to service of process in any jurisdiction where it is not now so subject,
except as to matters and transactions arising solely from the issuance of the
Exchangeable Shares and the Acquireco Shares), including using all
commercially reasonable efforts to:

       | (a)  |   | provide notice to, and obtain all waivers,
consents, permits, licenses, authorizations, orders, approvals and releases
necessary or desirable to complete the Transactions from, Agencies and other
persons, including parties to agreements, understandings or other documents
to which each of Target and Acquireco (and its respective Subsidiaries) is a
party or by which it or its properties are bound or affected (including loan
agreements, shareholder agreements, leases, pledges, guarantees and
security), the failure of which to provide or obtain would prevent
the completion of the Arrangement or which, individually or in the aggregate,
would reasonably be expected to be Materially Adverse to either Target or
Acquireco and their respective Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | obtain the Interim Order and the approval of Target
Securityholders at the Target Special Meeting at the earliest practicable
date, as specified in the Interim Order and the Final Order;  
      
    | (c)  |   | effect or cause to be effected all registrations and
filings and submissions of information necessary or desirable to complete the

      |   |   | Materially Adverse to either Target or Acquireco and
their respective Subsidiaries, in each case taken as a whole; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   |   
     | (d)  |   | keep the other reasonably informed as to the status
of the proceedings related to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, including
providing the other with copies of all related applications and
notifications.  
   

  

     B.  |   | Options.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Prior to the Effective Time, Targets board of
directors shall accelerate the vesting of otherwise unvested Target Options
and provide for the exercise of Target Options conditional on all conditions
precedent to the Arrangement being satisfied or waived such that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, such Target Options that have been so
conditionally exercised shall be deemed to have been exercised and the Target
Shares issuable on exercise of such Target Options shall be deemed to be
issued and outstanding. Target shall not permit or take any action to
facilitate the exercise of any Target Options on a cashless basis; provided
that holders of Target Options may arrange for financial assistance from
third parties (other than the Target or any of its Subsidiaries) to fund the
exercise of the Target Options.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Prior to the Effective Time and pursuant to Rule
16b-3(d) of the _Securities Exchange Act_ , the board of directors of
Acquireco will adopt a resolution approving the issuance pursuant to the Plan
of Arrangement of Acquireco Shares to any parties that will become executive
officers or directors of Acquireco and their affiliates so that such
issuances are exempt from application of Section 16b of the _Securities
Exchange Act_.  
   

  

     C.  |   | Defence of Proceedings.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Each of Target, Acquireco and Canco shall diligently defend, or
shall cause to be diligently defended, any lawsuits or other legal
proceedings brought against it or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
directors, officers or shareholders challenging this agreement or the
completion of the Transactions. Neither Target, Acquireco nor Canco shall
settle or compromise (or permit any of their respective Subsidiaries to
compromise or settle) any such claim brought in connection with the
Transactions, without the prior written consent of the other (provided that
written consent of Acquireco shall only be necessary to the extent settlement
of such claim would bind either Acquireco or Canco or in any material respect
affect, restrain or interfere with the conduct of the business of Target,
Acquireco or any of their Subsidiaries or the consummation of the
Transactions).  
      
  D.  |   | Waiver of Shareholder Rights Plan.  
      
    |   | Target shall take all required steps to cause the Target Rights
Plan to terminate effective upon the Effective Time, without payment of any
amounts to any holders thereunder. Prior to the earlier of (i) the Effective
Time and (ii) the termination of this agreement, Target shall not terminate,
waive any provision of, exempt any person from or amend the terms of the
Target Rights Plan (or redeem the Target Rights) except as provided
herein.   ##### 

 

 

\- 8 - 

      |   | Target hereby confirms, acknowledges and agrees (a) that
the board of directors of Target has extended and will continue to extend the
Separation Time (as defined in the Target Rights Plan) under the Target
Rights Plan in respect of the Arrangement until after the vote by the Target
Securityholders on the Arrangement at the Target Special Meeting, and (b) to
obtain the consent of Target Securityholders to waive the Target Rights Plan
so that neither the entering into nor delivery of this agreement, or the
other agreements contemplated hereby nor the consummation of all or any part
of the Transactions shall constitute a Flip-in Event (as defined in the
Target Rights Plan).  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     E.  |   | Securities Law Compliance and Related Covenants.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Acquireco shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which,
for greater certainty, shall not require Acquireco to consent to a term or
condition of an approval or consent which Acquireco reasonably determines
could have a Materially Adverse effect on Acquireco or its Subsidiaries):  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | to obtain all orders required from the applicable
Securities Commissions to permit the first resale of:  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (i)  |   | the Exchangeable Shares issued pursuant to the
Arrangement; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | the Acquireco Shares issued from time to time upon
exchange of the Exchangeable Shares, in each case without qualification with
or approval of or the filing of any prospectus, or the taking of any
proceeding with, or the obtaining of any further order, ruling or consent
from, any Securities Commission in any of the provinces or territories of
Canada (other than, with respect to such first resales, any restrictions on
transfer by reason of a holder being a "control person" of Acquireco or Canco
or Callco (as defined in the provisions attaching to the Exchangeable Shares)
for purposes of Canadian provincial or territorial securities Laws.  
   

  

       | (b)  |   | to cause the Exchangeable Shares to be listed and
posted for trading on the TSX by the Exchange Time and to take reasonable
steps to maintain such listing for so long as there are Exchangeable Shares
outstanding (other than those securities held by Acquireco or any of its
affiliates);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | to cause the listing and admission to trading on the
TSX and NASDAQ of the Acquireco Shares to be issued at the Exchange Time and
from time to time upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares;  
      
    | (d)  |   | to ensure that Canco is, at the Effective Time and for
so long as there are Exchangeable Shares outstanding (other than those
Exchangeable Shares held by Acquireco or any of its affiliates), a "taxable
Canadian corporation" and not a "mutual fund corporation," each within the
meaning of the ITA (as of the Effective Time and any modifications to such
definitions which are consistent with the principles thereof); and  ##### 

 

 

\- 9 -  

       | (e)  |   | to file a registration statement on Form S-3 in
order to register under the Securities Act the Acquireco Shares issued upon
exchange of the Exchangeable Shares from time to time after the Effective
Time, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration
statement to become effective at or prior to the Effective Time and to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration for the period that
such Exchangeable Shares remain outstanding.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     F.  |   | Registrar and Transfer Agent.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Target shall permit the registrar and transfer agent for Target
Shares to act as depositary in connection with the Arrangement and instruct
that transfer agent to furnish to Acquireco (and such persons as it may
reasonably designate) at such times as it may request such information and
provide to Acquireco (and such persons as it may designate) such
other assistance as it may reasonably request in connection with the
implementation and completion of the Transactions.  
      
  G.  |   | Access to Information; Confidentiality.  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Other than in respect of Proprietary Information
and subject to compliance with applicable Law, Target shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, afford to Acquireco and to its Representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the
Effective Time to all of the properties, books, contracts, commitments,
personnel and records of Target and its Subsidiaries and, during such period,
Target shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly
to Acquireco (i) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and
other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of
federal, provincial or state securities Laws and (ii) all other information
concerning its business, properties and personnel as Acquireco may reasonably
request, including any information with respect to Target Securityholder
Approval at the Target Special Meeting and the status of the efforts to
obtain such approval. Such information shall be held in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | During the period prior to the Effective Time, and
subject to compliance with applicable Law, Acquireco shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Target information concerning its
business and properties as Target may reasonably request. Such information
shall be held in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance
with, the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement.  
   

  

     H.  |   | Duty to Inform.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Each of Target and Acquireco shall keep the other apprised of
the status of matters relating to the completion of the Transactions and work
cooperatively in connection with obtaining the requisite approvals and
consents or governmental orders, including:  ##### 

 

 

\- 10 -  

     

  

       | (a)  |   | promptly notifying the other of, and, if in
writing, promptly furnish the other with copies of, any communications from
or with any Agency with respect to the Transactions;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | permitting the other party to review in advance, and
considering in good faith the view of one another in connection with, any
proposed communication with any Agency in connection with proceedings under
or relating to any applicable Law relating to the Transactions; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | not agreeing to participate in any meeting or
discussion with any Agency in connection with proceedings under or relating
to any applicable Law relating to the Transactions unless it consults with
the other party in advance, and, to the extent permitted by such Agency,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate for such
portions of such meeting or discussion at which matters relating to the
Transactions are to be discussed.  
   

  

     I.  |   | Board Recommendation.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | The board of directors of Target shall in the Target Circular,
subject to Section 6.E, recommend that Target Shareholders approve the
Arrangement.  
      
  J.  |   | Target Trust Indenture.  
      
    |   | Prior to the Effective Time, Target shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the approval of the Debentureholders (as defined
in the Target Trust Indenture) under the Trust Indenture to the consummation
of the Arrangement and to deliver to the Trustee (as defined in the Target
Trust Indenture) any documentation required under the terms of the Target
Trust Indenture in connection with seeking such approval.  
      
  K.  |   | Dividends  
      
    |   | If, on or after the date of this agreement, Target should
declare, set aside or pay any dividend or declare, make or pay any other
distribution or payment on any Target Shares, which is or are payable or
distributable to Target Shareholders on a record date prior to the Effective
Date, other than the next regularly scheduled semi-annual dividend of
$0.02 per Target Share payable following the date hereof, then the aggregate
amount of the consideration otherwise payable to Target Shareholders pursuant
to the Plan of Arrangement will be reduced by the amount of any such
dividend, distribution or payments.  
      
  L.  |   | Withholding Rights.  
      
    |   | Target, Canco, Callco, Acquireco and any person acting as
depositary (the "Depositary") in connection with the Arrangement shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, price or consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Target Shares, Acquireco Shares
or Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Target, Canco, Callco, Acquireco or
the Depositary is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such
payment under the ITA, United States tax laws or any other applicable Law. To ##### 

 

 

\- 11 -  

     

  

       |   | extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as having been paid to the
holder of the securities in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the
appropriate taxing Agency. To the extent that the amount so required to be
deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of
the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, Target, Canco, Callco,
Acquireco and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise
dispose of such other portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to Target, Canco, Callco, Acquireco and the Depositary, as
the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding
requirement and Target, Canco, Callco, Acquireco and the Depositary shall
notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds
of such sale.  
---|---|--- 
      
  M.  |   | Pre-Closing Reorganization.  
      
    |   | Target covenants and agrees that, upon the reasonable request
by Acquireco, Target shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to use
its reasonable commercial efforts to (i) take such actions to reorganize
their respective capital, assets and structure as Acquireco may request in
writing, acting reasonably (collectively, the "Pre-
Arrangement Reorganization") and (ii) cooperate with Acquireco and its
advisors in order to determine the nature of the Pre-Arrangement
Reorganization that might be undertaken and the manner in which it might most
effectively be undertaken; provided that the Pre-Arrangement Reorganization
(A) does not interfere with the ongoing operations of Target and
its Subsidiaries; (B) is not prejudicial to Target or any Subsidiary of
Target or Target Securityholders or inconsistent with the provisions of this
agreement; (C) shall not, and any actions taken in furtherance thereof shall
be considered not to, constitute a breach of the representations or
warranties or covenants hereunder; (D) does not require the directors,
officers, employees or agents of Target or its Subsidiaries to take any action
in any capacity other than as a director, officer or employee; (E) does not
impede, or interfere with, delay the occurrence of the Effective Date by more
than three Business Days after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the
conditions to be satisfied or waived in Schedules C, D or E, or prevent the
completion of the Transactions; (F) shall not affect or modify in any respect
the obligations of any of Acquireco or Canco under this agreement; (G) is
reasonably capable of being consummated following the date of the Final Order
and prior to the Effective Time; (H) does not have adverse Tax consequences
to Target or its Subsidiaries; and (I) does not require Target or any of its
Subsidiaries to obtain any waivers, consents, approvals, or make any filing
(other than any Tax filing or election) with, any Agency or other third party
or otherwise adversely affect any contract or agreement between Target or any
of its Subsidiaries and any third party. Acquireco shall provide written
notice to Target of any proposed Pre-Arrangement Reorganization at least five
business days prior to the Effective Time provided that the Pre-
Arrangement Reorganization shall in no event be effective prior to the
granting of the Final Order. Acquireco shall bear all costs of the Pre-
Arrangement Reorganization, including any liability for Taxes of Target or
any of the Subsidiaries that may arise as a result of such Pre-Arrangement
Reorganization. The parties will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
structure the Pre-Arrangement Reorganization in such a manner that it is made
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. In the event that the Pre-
Arrangement  ##### 

 

 

\- 12 -  

     

  

       |   | Reorganization is completed and the Arrangement is not
completed as contemplated herein as a result of any termination of this
agreement in accordance with its terms by Target, Acquireco shall reimburse
Target for any loss or damages, including any liability for Taxes, caused to
or incurred by Target or any of the Subsidiaries directly or indirectly as
a result of such Pre-Arrangement Reorganization and shall also bear any cost
associated with returning the corporate structure, capital structure,
business, operations and assets, as applicable and as the case may be, to
their state immediately prior to the Pre-Arrangement Reorganization (an
"Unwinding Transaction") where Target, in its sole discretion, considers such
Unwinding Transaction to be necessary or desirable.

or permitted by this agreement) do, permit any of its Subsidiaries to grant,
sell, transfer, pledge, lease, dispose of, encumber or agree to grant, sell,
pledge, lease, dispose of or encumber any property or assets of Acquireco or
any of its Subsidiaries, except in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice or as otherwise required to comply with the terms of
any credit agreement contemplated by the Commitment Letter.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     C.  |   | Financing Commitments.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Concurrently with the execution and delivery
hereof, Acquireco has delivered to Target a true copy of an executed
commitment letter addressed to Acquireco (the "Commitment Letter") from HSBC
Bank U.S.A., N.A. (the "Financier") pursuant to which the Financier has
committed to provide Acquireco and Canco with financing in an aggregate
amount of $100 million (the "Debt Financing"). The Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Acquireco, and to the knowledge of Acquireco, the other parties thereto. No
event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would constitute a default on the part of Acquireco under the Commitment
Letter. Acquireco has no reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy
on a timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it
contained in the Commitment Letter. Subject to its terms and conditions, the
Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letter, together with cash on hand at Acquireco and Target, will provide
Acquireco and Canco with cash proceeds at the Effective Time sufficient to
consummate the Arrangement upon the terms contemplated by this agreement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Acquireco shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to complete definitive documentation with respect to the Debt Financing or
alternative financing in the aggregate amount of $100 million on or before
January 18, 2010. In the event that Acquireco is unable to complete
definitive documentation with respect to either the Debt Financing or
alternative financing by January 18, 2010 in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, Acquireco shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to arrange the Debt Financing or obtain alternative financing in the
aggregate amount of $100 million as promptly as practicable and in any event
prior to the Outside Date, which Debt Financing or alternative financing
shall be on terms acceptable to Acquireco and Target, acting reasonably.
Acquireco shall give Target prompt notice of any breach or alleged breach by
any party of the Commitment Letter or any termination of the Commitment
Letter. Acquireco shall keep Target informed on a reasonably current basis in
reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing
or alternative financing. For the avoidance of doubt, if the Debt Financing
or any alternative financing has not been obtained, Acquireco and Canco shall
continue to be obligated to consummate the Arrangement on the  ##### 

 

 

\- 17 -  

       |   |   | terms contemplated by this agreement and the
failure to obtain the Debt Financing or any alternative financing shall not
be a condition to the obligations of Acquireco or Canco to perform its
obligations hereunder or to complete the Arrangement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | Acquireco shall at all times maintain in good standing
and in full force and effect its senior secured revolving credit facility
existing under that Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of
October 30, 2008 by and among Acquireco, the Financier and The Bank of Nova
Scotia, among others, and shall not draw any amounts thereunder except to
finance the cash portion of the consideration payable under
the Arrangement.  
   

  

     6.  |   | Alternative Transactions  
---|---|--- 
      
  A.  |   | Non-Solicitation; Adverse Acts.  
      
    |   | Except in respect of any action or inaction that is permitted
by this agreement, Target shall not (and shall not permit any of its
Subsidiaries to), directly or indirectly, through any of its or its
Subsidiaries Representatives or otherwise, take any action that
would reasonably be expected to in any way reduce the likelihood of the
successful completion of the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing,
Target shall not (and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to), directly
or indirectly, including through any of its or its Subsidiaries
Representatives:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
inquiries or the making by any third party of any proposals regarding an
Alternative Transaction;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Alternative Transaction;  
      
    | (c)  |   | approve or recommend any Alternative Transaction; or  
      
    | (d)  |   | accept or enter any agreement, arrangement or
understanding related to any Alternative Transaction.  
   

  

       |   | Additionally, Target shall:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (e)  |   | immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing discussions or negotiations, directly or indirectly, with any person
with respect to any Alternative Transaction; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (f)  |   | not, directly or indirectly, waive or vary any terms or
conditions of any confidentiality or standstill agreement that it has entered
into with any person considering any Alternative Transaction and shall
promptly request the return (or the deletion from retrieval systems and data
bases or the destruction) of all information, in each case subject to the
terms and conditions of each such agreement.  ##### 

 

 

\- 18 -  

     

  

     B.  |   | Permitted Actions.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Notwithstanding anything in this agreement, nothing shall
prevent Target, its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives or the board
of directors of Target from:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | complying with the obligations of the board of
directors of Target under applicable securities Law to prepare and deliver a
directors circular in response to a take-over bid;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | participating in any proceeding in respect of the
Target Rights Plan in accordance and consistent with Targets obligations
hereunder; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | considering, participating in discussions or
negotiations and entering into confidentiality agreements and providing
information, in each case pursuant to Section 6, regarding a _bona fide_
written Acquisition Proposal that (i) did not result from a breach of Section
6 prior thereto, and (ii) the board of directors of Target has determined by
formal resolution, in good faith and after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is or is reasonably likely to result in
a Superior Proposal, but only to the extent that the board of directors of
Target also has determined by formal resolution, in good faith after
consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties.  
   

  

       |   | The board of directors of Target shall not, except in
compliance with Section 6.E and F, approve, recommend, accept, support or
enter into any other agreement, arrangement or understanding in respect of
any such Acquisition Proposal other than a confidentiality agreement
contemplated by Section 6.D.  
---|---|--- 
      
  C.  |   | Notification of Acquisition Proposal.  
      
    |   | Target shall promptly notify Acquireco, at first orally and
then promptly thereafter in writing, of any Acquisition Proposal made after
the date hereof and any inquiry that Target reasonably expects to lead to any
Alternative Transaction, or any amendments to the foregoing, or any request
for information relating to Target or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with any Alternative Transaction or for access to the properties, books,
or records of Target or any of its Subsidiaries by any person that Target
reasonably believes is proposing to make, or has made, any Alternative
Transaction. Such notices shall include a description of the material terms
and conditions of any proposal and the identity of the person making such
proposal or inquiry. Target shall thereafter provide such other details of
the proposal or inquiry, discussions or negotiations as Acquireco may
reasonably request and shall attach copies of all letters, agreements and
other documentation (whether executed or in draft) exchanged by or on behalf
of Target and the party making the Acquisition Proposal in respect of such
Alternative Transaction. Target shall keep Acquireco reasonably informed by
way of further notices of the status including any change to the material
terms of any such Alternative Transaction.  ##### 

 

 

\- 19 -  

     

  

     D.  |   | Access to Information.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | If Target receives a request for information from a person that
has made a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal that complies with
Section 6.B(c)(i) and (ii), then, and only in such case, the board of
directors of Target may, subject to, only if such person is not already party
to a confidentiality agreement in favour of Target, the execution by such
person of a confidentiality agreement containing a commercially reasonable
standstill provision (which, for greater certainty, shall in no event prevent
or restrict such person, Target, its Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives, or the board of directors of Target from engaging in any
activities otherwise permissible under Section 6.B(c)), terms at least
as favourable to Target as those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
and a prohibition on such persons use of any information regarding the
Target or its Subsidiaries for any reason whatsoever other than as relates to
such persons evaluation and consummation of the transaction that is the
subject of the Acquisition Proposal, provide such person with access to
information regarding Target and its Subsidiaries; provided that Target sends
a copy of any such confidentiality agreement to Acquireco promptly upon its
execution and Target provides Acquireco (to the extent it has not already
done so) with copies of the information (other than any Proprietary
Information) provided to such person and promptly provides Acquireco with
access to all information to which such person was provided access
(other than any Proprietary Information).  
      
  E.  |   | Implementation of Superior Proposal.  
      
    |   | Subject to Acquirecos rights under Section 6.F, Target may
accept, approve or recommend (and thereby change its recommendation regarding
the Transactions) or enter into a definitive agreement, undertaking or
arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal in respect of which there has
been no breach of Section 6 only if:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Target has complied with its obligations under
this Section 6 with respect to the Superior Proposal, including by providing
Acquireco with all documentation required to be delivered under Section 6.C
and a copy of the Superior Proposal (including any draft agreement to be
entered into by Target which governs the Superior Proposal);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | a period expiring at 5:00 p.m. (Toronto time) on the
fifth business day (the "Response Period") after the later of (i) the date on
which Acquireco received written notice from the board of directors of Target
that it has resolved, subject only to compliance with this Section 6.E, to
accept, or enter into a definitive agreement, undertaking or arrangement in
respect of, a Superior Proposal, and (ii) the date Acquireco received a copy
of the Superior Proposal as provided in Section 6.E(a); and  
      
    | (c)  |   | the board of directors of Target has considered any
amendment to the terms of this agreement proposed in writing by Acquireco (or
on its behalf) before the end of the Response Period as contemplated in
Section 6.F and determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Superior Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal (as assessed against this  ##### 

 

 

\- 20 -  

       |   |   | agreement, together with the written amendments, if
any, proposed by Acquireco before the end of the Response Period) and that it
would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties not to enter into a binding
agreement in respect of the Superior Proposal.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    |

If the Response Period would not terminate before the Target Special Meeting,
at the request of Acquireco, Target shall adjourn the Target Special Meeting
to a date that is no less than two and no more than five business days after
the Response Period.

  
   

  

     F.  |   | Response by Acquireco.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | During the Response Period, Acquireco shall have the right, but
not the obligation, to offer in writing to amend the terms of this agreement.
The board of directors of Target shall review any such written offer by
Acquireco to amend this agreement in good faith, in consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to determine whether
the Acquisition Proposal to which Acquireco is responding would be a Superior
Proposal when assessed against this agreement, as would be amended in
accordance with the written amendments, if any, proposed by Acquireco before
the end of the Response Period. If the board of directors of Target does not
so determine by formal resolution, it shall enter into an amended agreement
with Acquireco and Canco reflecting Acquirecos proposed written amendments.
Provided that neither Acquireco nor Canco is in breach of or has failed
to perform any of its representations, warranties covenants or agreements set
forth in this agreement, where such breach or failure would render Acquireco
and Canco incapable of consummating the Transactions, if the board of
directors of Target does so determine then, subject only to Target paying (or
causing to be paid) to Acquireco $32 million (the "Termination Fee") in
immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquireco, Target may
enter into a definitive agreement, undertaking or arrangement in respect of,
a Superior Proposal; provided that in no event shall the board of directors
of Target take any action prior to the end of the Response Period that may
obligate Target or any other person to seek to interfere with the completion
of the Transactions, or impose any "break-up," "hello" or other fees or
options or rights to acquire assets or securities, or any other obligations
that would survive completion of the Transactions, on Target or any of
its Subsidiaries, property or assets.  
      
  G.  |   | General.  
      
    |   | Nothing in this Section 6 (except as contemplated in Section
6.E) shall limit the obligation of Target to convene and hold the Target
Special Meeting to consider the Arrangement as contemplated in Section 1.A.
Each successive amendment to any material terms of an Acquisition Proposal
shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal for the purposes of Section 6.E
and F and Acquireco shall be afforded a new Response Period in respect of each
such Acquisition Proposal.  #####

     7.  |   | Termination and Amendment of Agreement  
---|---|--- 
      
  A.  |   | Termination.  
      
    |   | The rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to this
agreement, other than pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 1.B, the last
sentence of Section 4.G(a), the last sentence of Section 4.M, and Sections 7,
8, 9.D, 10 and 11, may be terminated at any time before the Effective Time:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | by mutual agreement in writing executed by Target
and Acquireco (for itself and on behalf of Canco) (for greater certainty,
without further action on the part of Target Securityholders if termination
occurs after the holding of the Target Special Meeting);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | by Target,  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | after the Outside Date, if the conditions
provided in Section 2.A and B have not been satisfied or waived by Target on
or before the Outside Date, provided however that the right to terminate in
this Section 7.A(b)(i) shall not be available to Target if its failure to
fulfill any of its obligations under this agreement or if its breach of any
of its representations and warranties under this agreement has been the cause
of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such
Outside Date; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if there shall be enacted or made any applicable Law
that makes consummation of the Arrangement illegal or otherwise prohibited or
enjoins Target, Canco or Acquireco from consummating the Arrangement and
such applicable Law (if applicable) or enjoinment shall have become final
and non-appealable; or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | at any time if the board of directors of Target
authorizes Target to enter into a definitive agreement, undertaking or
arrangement in respect of a Superior Proposal in the circumstances
contemplated by Section 6.E; or  
      
    | (iv)  |   | at any time following the Target Special Meeting, if
Target Securityholders do not cast (or do not cause to be cast) sufficient
votes at the Target Special Meeting to permit completion of the Arrangement;
or  
      
    | (v)  |   | at any time if Acquireco or Canco shall have breached

agreements set forth in this agreement, which breach or failure is, or would
reasonably be expected to be, Materially Adverse to Acquireco and its
Subsidiaries as a whole; and

in this Section 7.A(c)(i) shall not be available to Acquireco if its or
Cancos failure to fulfill any of its or Cancos obligations under this
agreement or if its or Cancos breach of any of its or Cancos
representations and warranties under this agreement has been the cause of, or
resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur by such Outside Date;
or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if there shall be enacted or made any applicable Law
that makes consummation of the Arrangement illegal or otherwise prohibits or
enjoins Target, Acquireco or Canco from consummating the Arrangement and
such applicable Law (if applicable) or enjoinment shall have become final
and non-appealable; or  
      
    | (iii)  |   | at any time if the board of directors of Target, or
the Target, as applicable,  
   

  

       | (A)  |   | does not recommend in the Target Circular,
or withdraws or modifies in a manner adverse to Acquireco or refuses
to affirm (following the public announcement of any _bona fide_
Acquisition Proposal within the later of (i) 5 days after a written request
from Acquireco, and (ii) one calendar day following the expiry of
any applicable Response Periods) its recommendation that Target Shareholders
vote in favour of the Arrangement (it being acknowledged and agreed that a
recommendation that Target Shareholders vote in favour of the Arrangement
made by the board of directors of Target after the date hereof (including in
the Target Circular) other than on a unanimous basis shall not constitute a
withdrawal, adverse modification or failure to reaffirm the recommendation of
the board of directors of Target that Target Shareholders vote in favour of
the Arrangement); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (B)  |   | does not recommend against (following the public
announcement of any _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal within the later of (i)

following the expiry of any applicable Response Periods) the Target
Shareholders voting in favour of an Alternative Transaction, or

agreement, undertaking or arrangement in respect of an
Alternative Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement as
contemplated in Section 6) but excluding the resolutions referred to in
Section 6.B(c) and Section 6.E; or  
      
    | (D)  |   | breaches or fails to perform any of the covenants or
agreements set forth in Section 6 (other than those covenants and agreements
set forth in Sections 6.C and 6.D), or materially breaches or fails to  #####

     |   |   | perform in all material respects any of the covenants
or agreements set forth in Sections 6.C or 6.D; or

cancelled, adjourned or delayed except as expressly permitted or contemplated
by this agreement or agreed to by Acquireco in writing or requested by
Acquireco;

Target Securityholders do not cast (or do not cause to be cast) sufficient
votes at the Target Special Meeting to permit completion of the Arrangement;
and  
      
    | (vi)  |   | at any time if Target shall have breached or failed to
perform any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set
forth in this agreement, which breach or failure is, or would reasonably be
expected to be, Materially Adverse to the Target and its Subsidiaries as a
whole.  
   

  

       |   | Neither Target nor Acquireco may seek to rely upon the
failure to satisfy any conditions precedent in Section 2.A, B or C or
exercise any termination right arising therefrom or any termination right
provided in Sections 7.A(b)(v) or 7.A(c)(vi), unless forthwith and in
any event prior to the filing of the articles of arrangement for acceptance
by the Director, Target or Acquireco, as the case may be, has delivered a
written notice to the other specifying in reasonable detail all breaches of
covenants, representations and warranties or other matters which Target or
Acquireco, as the case may be, is asserting as the basis for the non-
fulfilment of the applicable condition precedent or the exercise of the
termination right, as the case may be. If any such notice is delivered,
provided that Target or Acquireco, as the case may be, is proceeding
diligently to cure all such matters, if and for so long as all such matters
are susceptible of being cured (for greater certainty, except by way of
disclosure in the case of representations and warranties) ("Curable Matters"),
the other may not terminate this agreement as a result thereof until the
earlier of (i) the date that any Curable Matter is no longer susceptible of
being cured, (ii) the date that Target or Acquireco, as the case may be, is
no longer proceeding diligently to cure all Curable Matters, and (iii) the
later of (A) the Outside Date and (B) the expiration of a period of 15 days
from such notice (the "Termination Period"). If such notice has been delivered
prior to the date of the Target Special Meeting, such meeting shall, unless
the parties agree otherwise, be postponed or adjourned until the earlier of
(i) the date that is two business days after the date that Target or
Acquireco, as the case maybe, notifies the other that all Curable Matters
have been cured, and (ii) the expiry of the Termination Period unless
this Agreement is terminated on such date. If such notice has been delivered
prior to the making of the application for the Final Order or the filing of
the articles of arrangement for acceptance by the Director, such application
and such filing shall be postponed until the earlier of (x) the date that is
two business days after the date that Target or Acquireco, as the case maybe,
notifies the other that all Curable Matters have been cured, and (y)
the expiry of the Termination Period unless this Agreement is terminated on
such date. For greater certainty, if all Curable Matters are cured within the
Termination Period without being Materially Adverse to the curing party and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, this agreement may not be terminated as a
result of the Curable Matter having been cured.

\- 24 -  

       |   | In the event of the termination of this agreement as
provided in Section 7.A, this agreement shall forthwith have no further force
or effect and there shall be no obligation on the part of Acquireco, Canco or
Target hereunder except as set forth in the last paragraph of Section 1.B,
the last sentence of Section 4.G(a), the last sentence of Section 4.M, and
Sections 7, 8, 9.D, 10 and 11, which provisions shall survive the termination
of this agreement; provided further that, subject to Section 8.B, the
termination of this agreement in accordance with Section 7.A shall not
relieve any party from any liability for any material breach by it of this
agreement. A termination of this agreement shall not constitute a termination
of the Confidentiality Agreement which shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with its terms.  
---|---|--- 
      
  B.  |   | Amendment.  
      
    |   | This agreement, including the Plan of Arrangement, may be
amended by written agreement of the parties at any time before and after the
Target Special Meeting, but not later than the Effective Date and any such
amendment may, subject to applicable Law or the Interim Order, without
limitation:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | change the time for performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the parties;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | waive any inaccuracies in or modify any representation
contained in this agreement or any document to be delivered pursuant to this
agreement;  
      
    | (c)  |   | waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants
contained in this agreement or waive or modify performance of any of the
obligations of the parties; and/or  
      
    | (d)  |   | waive compliance with or modify any condition precedent
contained in this agreement.  
   

  

     C.  |   | Approval of Amendments.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | Target and Acquireco will use all commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain the approvals of the Court and Target Shareholders in
respect of any amendments to this agreement, including the Plan of
Arrangement, to the extent required by applicable Law.  
      
  8.  |   | Termination Payments  
      
  A.  |   | Payment to Acquireco.  
      
    |   | Provided that neither Acquireco nor Canco is in breach of or
has failed to perform any of its representations, warranties covenants or
agreements set forth in this agreement, where such breach or failure would
render Acquireco and Canco incapable of consummating the Transactions:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | If Target is required to pay Acquireco the
Termination Fee in accordance with Sections 6.E and 6.F, Target shall
immediately pay (or cause to be paid) the  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

\- 25 -  

     |   |   | Termination Fee to Acquireco in immediately available
funds to an account designated by Acquireco.  
---|---|---|--- 
     
     | (b)  |   | If Acquireco exercises its right of termination
pursuant to Section 7.A(c)(iii)(A), (B) or (C) or Section 7.A(c)(iv), Target
shall immediately pay (or cause to be paid) the Termination Fee to Acquireco
in immediately available funds to an account designated by Acquireco.  
      
    | (c)  |   | If Acquireco exercises its right of termination
pursuant to Section 7.A(c)(v) or Target exercises its right of termination
pursuant to Section 7.A(b)(iv), Target (i) shall immediately pay (or cause to
be paid) to Acquireco in immediately available funds to an account designated
by Acquireco, Acquirecos reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses
incurred in connection with this agreement up to a maximum of $5 million
(but, for greater certainty, excluding any fees of any financial
advisors) (such amount so paid, the "Expenses"), and (ii) if, prior to the
time of the Target Special Meeting, a _bona fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal has been publicly announced and has not been withdrawn and at any
time within the six months after the date of such termination, Target
approves, recommends, accepts, enters into any agreement, undertaking or
arrangement in respect of, or consummates an Acquisition Proposal, Target
shall immediately pay (or cause to be paid) to Acquireco an additional
cash amount equal to the difference between the Termination Fee and the
Expenses in immediately available funds to an account designated by
Acquireco.  
   

  

       |   | For greater certainty, in no circumstance shall Target be
obligated to make a payment under more than one of subparagraphs (a), (b) and
(c) of this Section 8.A.  
---|---|--- 
      
  B.  |   | Damages.  
      
    |   | The parties acknowledge and agree that the payment of the
Termination Fee or other amounts set forth in Section 8.A are payments of
liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-estimate of the damages which
Acquireco and Canco would suffer or incur as a result of the event giving
rise to such damages and the resultant termination of this agreement and are
not a penalty. The parties further acknowledge and agree, however, that,
notwithstanding any other provision in this agreement to the contrary, in
connection with any termination of this agreement where a Termination Fee or
other amount set forth in Section 8.A is not paid or payable, Target,
Acquireco and Canco shall be entitled to any additional remedies set forth in
this agreement, including injunctive relief and specific performance, and
all additional and other remedies available at law or in equity to which
Target, Acquireco or Canco, as applicable, may be entitled. Target
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise a defence that any amounts
that are required to be paid to Acquireco pursuant to Section 8.A are
excessive or punitive. Acquireco and Canco agree that the payment of
the Termination Fee and other amounts set forth in Section 8.A are the sole
and exclusive remedies of Acquireco and Canco in respect of the events giving
rise to the payment of such amounts.  #####

     9.  |   | Acquireco Covenants.  
---|---|--- 
      
  A.  |   | Indemnities.  
      
    |   | From and after the Effective Time, and subject to the
immediately following paragraph, Acquireco shall, and shall cause Target to,
indemnify and hold harmless and provide advancement of expenses to, and
Acquireco shall not do anything to prevent Target from indemnifying and
holding harmless and providing advancement of expenses to, all present
and past directors and officers of any member of the Target Group (the
"Indemnified Persons") to the maximum extent permitted by Law and in
accordance with the terms of any such arrangements between Target and its
present and past directors and officers existing on the date hereof, against
any and all liabilities and obligations, costs or expenses
(including reasonable legal fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages
or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative arising out of or related to such Indemnified Persons service
as a director or officer of any member of the Target Group or
services performed by such persons at the request of any member of the Target
Group at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, including the approval of this agreement,
the Arrangement or the other transactions contemplated by this agreement or
arising out of or related to this agreement and the Transactions contemplated
hereby.  
      
    |   | Without the consent of the Indemnified Person, neither
Acquireco nor Target shall settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any
judgment in any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation or
threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for
which indemnification is required to be provided under this Section 9 (i)
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional
release of the applicable Indemnified Person (which release shall be in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Person) from all
liability arising out of such action, suit, proceeding, investigation
or claim or such Indemnified Person otherwise consents or (ii) that includes
an admission of fault of such Indemnified Person.  
      
    |   | Subject only to the limitations set forth in this Section 9,
all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to
advancement of expenses relating thereto now existing in favour of any
Indemnified Person as provided in the articles of incorporation or by-laws of
any member of the Target Group or any indemnification contract or policy
between such Indemnified Person and any member of the Target Group existing
on the date hereof shall survive the Effective Time and shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such Indemnified Person.  
      
  B.  |   | Directors and Officers Insurance and Other Indemnification
Matters.  
      
    |   | Without limiting the right of Target to do so prior to the
Effective Time, Acquireco hereby agrees to cause Target to secure directors
and officers liability insurance coverage by not later than the Effective
Time from a reputable and financially sound  ##### 

 

 

\- 27 -  

       |   | insurance carrier and containing terms and conditions
that are no less advantageous to the directors and officers of the Target
Group than those contained in Targets policy in effect on the date hereof
for the current and former directors and officers of each member of
the Target Group on a six year "trailing" (or "run-off") basis with respect
to any claim related to any period or time at or prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that Acquireco and Target shall not be required to
maintain or obtain policies providing such coverage except to the extent such
coverage can be provided at an annual cost of no greater than 200% of the
most recent annual premium paid by Target prior to the date hereof (the
"Cap"); and provided, further, that if equivalent coverage cannot be
obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of
the Cap, Acquireco shall only be required to cause Target to obtain as much
coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap.  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | If any member of the Target Group or any of their respective
successors or assigns shall (i) amalgamate, consolidate with or merge or
wind-up into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity, or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, Acquireco
shall assume all of the obligations of Target set forth in Sections 9.A and
9.B.  
      
  C.  |   | Employment Agreements.  
      
    |   | Acquireco covenants and agrees, at and after the Effective
Time, that it will cause each member of the Target Group and any of their
respective successors to honour and comply with the terms of all existing
employment agreements, termination, severance, change of control, retention
plans or policies and pension plans and similar agreements of the Target Group
as disclosed in the Target Disclosure Statement. Nothing in this Section 9.C
shall limit any member of the Target Group from terminating any of their
employees, subject to applicable Law and the terms of any applicable
contract.  
      
  D.  |   | Third Party Beneficiaries.  
      
    |   | This agreement is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon
any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as set forth in or
contemplated by the terms and provisions of Section 9.A, B, C, this Section
9.D, the last paragraph of Section 1.B, the first sentence of Section 4.A1
and Section 4.E(e) (which provisions shall for greater certainty survive
the Effective Time and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms after the Effective Time).  
      
  E.  |   | Guarantee.  
      
    |   | Acquireco unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees, covenants
and agrees to be jointly and severally liable with Canco for the due and
punctual performance of each and every obligation of Canco arising under this
agreement and in respect of the Transactions.  
      
  10.  |   | Confidentiality and Public Disclosure  
      
    |   | Target and Acquireco shall consult with each other as to the
general nature of any news releases or public statements with respect to this
agreement or the Transactions, and shall  ##### 

 

 

\- 28 -  

     |   | use their respective commercially reasonable efforts not to
issue any news releases or public statements inconsistent with the results of
such consultations. Subject to applicable Law, each party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to enable the other party to review and
comment on all such news releases and public statements prior to the
release thereof. The parties agree to issue jointly the news release in the
agreed form with respect to this agreement and the Transactions following the
execution of this agreement in accordance with Section 1.D. Target and
Acquireco shall consult with each other in preparing and making any filings
and communications in connection with any Regulatory Approvals and in seeking
any third-party consents contemplated in Section 4.A.

several basis with any such entity, to Target for any default in performance
by the assignee of any of Acquirecos or Cancos obligations hereunder
and Acquireco agrees to provide to Target a guarantee in form and substance
satisfactory to Target in respect thereof.  
      
  C.  |   | Binding Effect.  
      
    |   | This agreement, including (for greater certainty) the Plan of
Arrangement, shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. No third party shall have any rights under this agreement
except as expressly set forth in Section 9.D.  
      
  D.  |   | Representatives.  
      
    |   | Each of Target and Acquireco and Canco shall ensure that its
and its Subsidiaries Representatives (other than persons who are insiders
only as a result of their shareholdings) are aware of the provisions of this
agreement, and each of Target and Acquireco and Canco shall be responsible
for any breach of those provisions by any of those persons, respectively.  #####

expected to be, in the case of Target, Materially Adverse to Target or its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole or, in the case of Acquireco, is or would
reasonably be expected to be Materially Adverse to the ability of
Acquireco or Canco to perform its obligations under this agreement.

  H.  |   | Governing Law.  
      
    |   | This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the Province of Ontario and the laws of Canada applicable
herein. Each party hereto irrevocably submits to the non-exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the Province of Ontario with respect to any
matter arising hereunder or related hereto.  
      
  I.  |   | Injunctive Relief.  
      
    |   | Except as otherwise provided herein (including Section 8), any
and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed
cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by
Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy
will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto hereby
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision
of this agreement were not performed in accordance with its specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that money damages or other legal remedies would
not be an adequate remedy for any such damages. Accordingly, the parties
hereto acknowledge and hereby agree that in the event of any breach or
threatened breach by Target, on the one hand, or Acquireco or Canco, on the
other hand, of any of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in
this agreement, Target, on the one hand, and Acquireco and Canco, on the
other hand, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this agreement by the other, and
to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this agreement to prevent
breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of the other under this agreement. Each of the
parties hereto hereby agrees not to raise any objections to the availability
of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this agreement by it, and to specifically
enforce the terms and provisions of this agreement to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and
obligations of the other party under this agreement.  
      
    |   | The parties hereto further agree that, except as provided
herein (including Section 8) (x) by seeking the remedies provided for in this
Section 11.I, a party shall not in any respect  ##### 

 

 

\- 32 -  

       |   | waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may
be available to a party under this agreement in the event that this agreement
has been terminated or in the event that the remedies provided for in this
Section 11.I are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (y) nothing
set forth in this Section 11.I shall require any party hereto to
institute any proceeding for (or limit any partys right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this Section 11.I prior or as a
condition to exercising any termination right under Section 7.A (and pursuing
damages after such termination), nor shall the commencement of any legal
proceeding restrict or limit any partys right to terminate this agreement in
accordance with the terms of Section 7.A or pursue any other remedies
under this agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

  J.  |   | Currency.  
      
    |   | Except as expressly indicated otherwise, all sums of money
referred to in this agreement are expressed and shall be payable in United
States dollars.  
      
  K.  |   | Accounting Matters.  
      
    |   | All accounting terms used in this agreement shall have the
meanings attributable thereto under GAAP and all determinations of an
accounting nature required to be made in respect of Target and Acquireco
shall be made in a manner consistent with GAAP.  
      
  L.  |   | Knowledge.  
      
    |   | Where the phrase "to the knowledge of Target" is used, such
phrase shall mean, in respect of each representation and warranty or other
statement which is qualified by such phrase, that such representation and
warranty or other statement is being made based upon the actual knowledge of
Douglas Silver, Ray Jenner, Paul Zink, James Lydic and David Hammond
after reasonable inquiry within Target (which, for greater certainty, shall
not require any new third party audits or studies or require any enquiries of
third parties).  
      
    |   | Where the phrase "to the knowledge of Acquireco" is used, such
phrase shall mean, in respect of each representation and warranty or other
statement which is qualified by such phrase, that such representation and
warranty or other statement is being made based upon the actual knowledge of
Tony Jensen, Stefan Wenger, Bill Heissenbuttel and Bruce Kirchhoff
after reasonable inquiry within Acquireco (which, for greater certainty,
shall not require any new third party audits or studies or require any
enquiries of third parties).  
      
  M.  |   | Entire Agreement.  
      
    |   | This agreement, including the Plan of Arrangement, constitutes
the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the Transactions, as of
the date of this agreement, and shall supersede all agreements,
understandings, negotiations and discussions whether oral or written, between
the parties, including the Exclusivity Agreement, with respect to

Confidentiality Agreement.  #####

hereafter, at the request of the other party hereto, but without further
consideration, do all such further acts and execute and deliver all such
further documents and instruments as shall be reasonably required in order to
fully perform and carry out the terms and intent hereof and of the Plan of
Arrangement.  
      
    |   | The parties shall act in a commercially reasonable manner in
exercising their rights and performing their duties under this agreement.  
      
  O.  |   | Waivers and Modifications.  
      
    |   | Target and Acquireco (for itself and on behalf of Canco) may
waive or consent to the modification of, in whole or in part, any inaccuracy
of any representation or warranty made to it under this agreement or in any
document to be delivered pursuant to this agreement and may waive or consent
to the modification of any or the obligations contained in this agreement for
its benefit or waive or consent to the modification of any of the
obligations of the other party. Any waiver or consent to the modification of
any of the provisions of this agreement, to be effective, must be in writing
executed by the party granting such waiver or consent.

\- 34 -  

       | (iv)  |   | "Personal Information" means information (other
than business contact information when used or disclosed for the purpose of
contacting such individual in that individuals capacity as an employee or an
official of an organization and for no other purpose) about an identifiable

at all times keep strictly confidential all Disclosed Personal Information
provided to it, and shall instruct those employees or advisors responsible

shall fully co-operate with one another, with the persons to whom the
Personal Information relates, and any authorized authority charged with
enforcement of applicable privacy laws, in responding to such inquiries,
complaints, requests for access, variations or withdrawals of consent and
claims.

otherwise upon the reasonable request of either party, the other party shall
forthwith cease all use of the Disclosed Personal Information acquired by it

       | (c)  |   | the aggregate amount of Cash Consideration that
would, but for this Section 2.4(c), be payable to IRC Shareholders pursuant

of Shares, then (i) the Elected Percentage (the "Deemed Share Consideration
Elected Percentage") of the RG Share Consideration or Exchangeable Share

Shareholder shall be determined by multiplying the Elected Percentage of
the RG Share Consideration or Exchangeable Share Consideration, as the case
may be, otherwise determined in respect of such IRC Share by a fraction,
rounded to six decimal places, the numerator of which is the Maximum
Aggregate Number of Shares and the denominator of which is the aggregate
number of RG Shares and Exchangeable Shares otherwise issuable to all  ##### 

 

 

B-9

transfer of their IRC Shares to Canco by providing the Tax Election Package
to the Depositary within 90 days following the Effective Date, duly completed
with the details of the number of IRC Shares transferred and the applicable
agreed amounts (which cannot be less than the fair market value of the
Ancillary Rights at the Exchange Time). Thereafter, subject to the Tax
Election Package being correct and complete and complying with the provisions
of the ITA (or applicable provincial income or corporate tax Law), the
relevant forms will be signed by Canco and returned to such persons within 90
days after the receipt thereof by the Depositary for filing with the CRA (or

the proper or accurate completion of the Tax Election Package or to check or
verify the content of any election form and, except for Cancos obligation to
return duly completed Tax Election Packages which are received by the
Depositary within 90 days of the Effective Date, within 90 days after the
receipt thereof by the Depositary, Canco will not be responsible for any
taxes, interest or penalties or any other costs or damages resulting from the
failure by an IRC Shareholder to properly and accurately complete or file the
necessary election forms in the form and manner and within the time
prescribed by the ITA (or any applicable provincial legislation). In its sole
discretion, Canco may choose to sign and return Tax Election Packages
received more than 90 days following the Effective Date, but Canco will have
no obligation to do so.

pursuant to the Arrangement shall be removed from the register of holders of

shall become the holder of such IRC Shares and shall be added to that
register at that time and shall be entitled as of that time to all of the

acquires Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares pursuant to the Arrangement shall
be added to the register of holders of Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares,
respectively, and shall be entitled as of the time of the exchange to all of
the rights and privileges attached to the Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares,
as the case may be. 

  

2.7 Adjustments to Consideration. The consideration to be paid pursuant to
Sections 2.2(b) and 2.2(c) shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect of

determined as of the Exchange Time, shall be deemed to have transferred those
IRC Shares as of the Exchange Time at the fair value of the IRC Shares

    | (b)  |   | ultimately are determined not to be entitled, for any
reason, to be paid fair value for their IRC Shares, shall be deemed to have

Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Exchange Time represented IRC Shares that were
exchanged under the Arrangement, together with a duly completed Letter of
Transmittal and Election Form and such other documents and instruments as the
Depositary may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate
shall be entitled to receive, and promptly after the Exchange Time the
Depositary shall deliver to such person, certificates registered in the name
of such person representing that number of Exchangeable Shares and/or RG
Shares which such person is entitled to receive (together with any cash in
lieu of fractional Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares pursuant to Section 4.3)
and a cheque for the Cash Consideration which such person is entitled
to receive, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.6, and any
certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of such IRC Shares which was not registered in the
transfer records of IRC, certificates representing the number of
Exchangeable Shares and/or RG Shares issuable to the registered holder may be
registered in the name of and issued to, and a cheque for the Cash
Consideration payable to  ##### 

 

 

B-11  

the registered holder may be made payable to, the transferee if the
certificate representing such IRC Shares is presented to the Depositary,
accompanied by a duly completed Letter of Transmittal and Election Form and
all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer. Without limiting
the provisions of Sections 2.6 and 4.5, until surrendered as contemplated by
this Section 4.1, each certificate which immediately prior to the Exchange
Time represented one or more outstanding IRC Shares that, under the
Arrangement, were exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2(c), shall be deemed at all
times after the Exchange Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender (i) the consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled
under the Arrangement, or as to a certificate held by a Dissenting
Shareholder (other than a shareholder who exercised Dissent Rights who is
deemed to have participated in the Arrangement pursuant to Section 3.1(b)),
to receive the fair value of the IRC Shares represented by such certificate,
and (ii) any dividends or distributions with a record date after the Exchange
Time theretofore paid or payable with respect to any Exchangeable Shares or
RG Shares issued in exchange therefor as contemplated by Section 4.2, in each
case less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 4.6. 

  

4.2 Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates. No dividends or
other distributions paid, declared or made with respect to Exchangeable
Shares or RG Shares, in each case with a record date after the Exchange Time,
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate which
immediately prior to the Exchange Time represented outstanding IRC Shares or
in lieu of fractional Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares shall be paid to any
such person pursuant to Section 4.3, unless and until such person shall have
complied with the provisions of Section 4.1. Subject to applicable Law, and
to the provisions of Section 4.5, at the time such person shall have complied
with the provisions of Section 4.1 (or, in the case of clause (iii) below, at
the appropriate payment date), there shall be paid to such person, without
interest (i) the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
Exchangeable Share or RG Share to which such person is entitled pursuant to
Section 4.3, (ii) the amount of dividends or other distributions with a
record date after the Exchange Time theretofore paid with respect to the
Exchangeable Share or the RG Share, as the case may be, to which such person
is entitled pursuant hereto, and (iii) on the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Exchange Time but prior to the date of compliance by such person with the
provisions of Section 4.1 and a payment date subsequent to the date of such
compliance and payable with respect to such Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares,
as the case may be. 

  

4.3 No Fractional Shares. No certificates representing fractional Exchangeable
Shares or fractional RG Shares shall be issued upon compliance with the
provisions of Section 4.1 and no dividend, stock split or other change in the
capital structure of Canco or RG shall relate to any such fractional security
and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to exercise
any rights as a security holder of Canco or RG. Canco will make arrangements
with the Depositary for the issuance to the Depositary of RG Shares in
respect of any such fractional security and shall instruct the Depositary to
aggregate and, as soon as is reasonably practicable following the Effective
Date, sell such RG Shares. The proceeds (net of any commissions in respect of
the sale but excluding any deduction for the fees of the Depositary, which
fees shall be paid by Canco) (the "Net Proceeds") received by the Depositary
from such sale shall, as soon as is reasonably practicable be distributed to
each person otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in an Exchangeable
Share or RG Share on a pro rata basis. The Depositary shall be entitled to
retain such brokers and advisors as may be necessary in connection with the
sale of the RG Shares and shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
to be taken in connection with the sale of the RG Shares or the distribution

Proceeds referred to in this Section 4.3. Under no circumstances
shall interest accrue or be paid by Canco, RG or the Depositary to persons
depositing IRC Shares pursuant to Section 2.2, regardless of any delay in
selling the RG Shares or making any delivery or payment in respect of such
shares. 

  

4.4 Lost Certificates. In the event any certificate which immediately prior to
the Exchange Time represented one or more outstanding IRC Shares that were
exchanged pursuant to Section 2.2 shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, any cash and/or
certificates representing Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares (and any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) deliverable in accordance with Section
2.2 and such holders Letter of Transmittal and Election Form. When
authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or destroyed
certificate, the person to whom cash (if any) and/or certificates
representing Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares are to be issued shall, as
a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, give a bond satisfactory to
IRC, Canco, RG and their respective transfer agents in such amount as IRC,
Canco or RG may direct or otherwise indemnify IRC, Canco and RG in a manner
satisfactory to IRC, Canco and RG against any claim that may be made against
IRC, Canco or RG with respect to the certificate alleged to have been lost,
stolen or destroyed. 

  

4.5 Extinction of Rights. Any certificate which immediately prior to the
Exchange Time represented outstanding IRC Shares that were exchanged pursuant
to Section 2.2 that is not deposited with all other instruments required by
Section 4.1 on or prior to the date of the notice referred to in Section 7(2)
of the Exchangeable Share Provisions shall cease to represent a claim or
interest of any kind or nature as a securityholder of Canco or RG. On such
date, the cash and/or Exchangeable Shares and/or RG Shares to which the
former holder of the certificate referred to in the preceding sentence was
ultimately entitled shall be deemed to have been surrendered for no
consideration to Canco. None of RG, IRC, Canco, Callco or the Depositary
shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law. 

  

4.6 Withholding Rights. IRC, Canco, Callco, RG and the Depositary shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, price or consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of IRC Shares, RG Shares or Exchangeable
Shares such amounts as IRC, Canco, Callco, RG or the Depositary is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the ITA, United States
tax laws or any other applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the holder of the securities in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are
actually remitted to the appropriate taxing Agency. To the extent that the
amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder
exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the
holder, IRC, Canco, Callco, RG and the Depositary are hereby authorized to
sell or otherwise dispose of such other portion of the consideration as is
necessary to provide sufficient funds to IRC, Canco, Callco, RG and the
Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or
withholding requirement and IRC, Canco, Callco, RG and the Depositary
shall notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net
proceeds of such sale.  #####

     5.1  |   | Callco Liquidation Call Right.  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | Callco shall have the overriding right (the
"Liquidation Call Right), in the event of and notwithstanding the proposed
liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Canco or any other distribution of
the assets of Canco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs, pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions, to
purchase from all but not less than all of the holders of Exchangeable Shares
(other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is RG or an affiliate of
RG) on the Liquidation Date all but not less than all of the Exchangeable
Shares held by each such holder on payment by Callco of an amount per share
(the "Liquidation Call Purchase Price") equal to the Current Market Price of
RG Shares on the last business day prior to the Liquidation Date plus the
Dividend Amount, which shall be satisfied in full by Callco delivering or
causing to be delivered to such holder one RG Share plus any Dividend Amount.
In the event of the exercise of the Liquidation Call Right by Callco, each
holder shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares held by
the holder to Callco on the Liquidation Date on payment by Callco to the
holder of the Liquidation Call Purchase Price for each such share, and Canco
shall have no obligation to pay any Liquidation Amount or Dividend Amount to
the holders of such shares so purchased by Callco.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | To exercise the Liquidation Call Right, Callco must
notify the Transfer Agent, as agent for the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
and Canco of Callcos intention to exercise such right at least 45 days
before the Liquidation Date in the case of a voluntary liquidation,

assets of Canco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs, and at least five business days before the Liquidation Date in the
case of an involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Canco or any
other involuntary distribution of the assets of Canco among its shareholders
for the purpose of winding up its affairs. The Transfer Agent will notify the
holders of Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has exercised the
Liquidation Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period during which
the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the Liquidation Call
Right, then on the Liquidation Date, Callco will purchase and the holders
will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then outstanding for a price per
share equal to the Liquidation Call Purchase Price.  
      
    | (c)  |   | For the purposes of completing the purchase of the

complied with the immediately preceding sentence, on and after the

of holders in respect thereof (including any rights under the Voting and

proportionate part of the aggregate Liquidation Call Purchase Price
without interest, unless payment of the aggregate Liquidation Call Purchase
Price for the Exchangeable Shares shall not be made upon presentation and
surrender of share certificates in accordance with the following provisions
of this Section 5.1(c), in which case the rights of the holders shall remain
unaffected until the aggregate Liquidation Call Purchase Price has been paid
in the manner herein provided. Upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of a
certificate or certificates representing Exchangeable Shares, together with
such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer
of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and articles of Canco and such
additional documents, instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent
may reasonably require, the holder of such surrendered certificate or
certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the
Transfer Agent on behalf of Callco shall transfer to such holder, the RG
Shares to which such holder is entitled and as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter the Transfer Agent shall deliver to such holder certificates
representing the RG Shares to which the holder is entitled and a cheque or

the transfer of such RG Shares to such holder, less any amounts withheld
pursuant to Section 4.6. If Callco does not exercise the Liquidation
Call Right in the manner described above, on the Liquidation Date, the
holders of the Exchangeable Shares will be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Liquidation Amount otherwise payable by Canco in connection with
the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Canco or any distribution of
the assets of Canco among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its
affairs pursuant to Section 5 of the Exchangeable Share Provisions.

Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is RG

Provisions), an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable
Share Voting Event, in which case Callco shall so notify the Transfer Agent
and Canco on or before the Redemption Date. The Transfer Agent will notify
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares as to whether or not Callco has
exercised the Redemption Call Right forthwith after the expiry of the period
during which the same may be exercised by Callco. If Callco exercises the
Redemption Call Right, on the Redemption Date Callco will purchase and the

Exchangeable Shares (other than any holder of Exchangeable Shares which is an
affiliate of RG) all but not less than all of the Exchangeable Shares held by

of Exchangeable Shares shall be obligated to sell all the Exchangeable Shares
held by such holder to RG or Callco, as the case may be, on the Change of Law
Call Date upon payment by RG or Callco, as the case may be, to such holder of

RG or Callco, as the case may be, will purchase and the holders
of Exchangeable Shares will sell all of the Exchangeable Shares then
outstanding for a price per share equal to the Change of Law Call Purchase
Price.  
      
    | (c)  |   | For the purposes of completing the purchase of the
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Change of Law Call Right,

financial or economic interests of any IRC Shareholder.  
   

  

SECTION 7  FURTHER ASSURANCES 

   

 Each of IRC and RG shall make, do and execute, or cause to be made, done and executed, all such further acts, deeds, agreements, transfers, assurances, instruments or documents as may reasonably be required by either of them to document or evidence any of the transactions or events set out in this Plan of Arrangement. 

   

SECTION 8  NOTICE 

   

 Any notice to be given by RG to IRC Shareholders or IRC Optionholders pursuant to the Arrangement will be deemed to have been properly given if it is mailed by first class mail, postage prepaid, to registered IRC Shareholders or IRC Optionholders, as the case may be, at their addresses as shown on the applicable register of such holders maintained by IRC and will be deemed to have been received on the first day following the date of mailing which is a business day. 

   

 The provisions of this Plan of Arrangement, the Arrangement Agreement and the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form apply notwithstanding any accidental omission to give notice to any one or more IRC Shareholders or IRC Optionholders and notwithstanding any interruption of mail services in Canada, the United States or elsewhere following mailing. In the event of any interruption of mail service following mailing, RG intends to make reasonable efforts to disseminate any notice by other means, such as publication.

be given under the Arrangement will be deemed to have been properly given and
to have been received by IRC Shareholders and IRC Optionholders if (i) it is
given to the TSX for dissemination or (ii) it is published once in the
national edition of _The Globe and Mail_ and in the daily newspapers of
general circulation in each of the French and English languages in the City
of Montreal, provided that if the national edition of _The Globe and Mail_ is
not being generally circulated, publication thereof will be made in _The

made in the New York Times or any other daily newspaper of general
circulation published in New York City.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 Notwithstanding the provisions of the Arrangement Agreement, this Plan of Arrangement and the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, certificates for RG Shares and Exchangeable Shares issuable, and cheques for cash amounts payable, pursuant to the Arrangement need not be mailed if RG determines that delivery thereof by mail may be delayed. Persons entitled to cheques and certificates which are not mailed for the foregoing reason may take delivery thereof at the office of the Transfer Agent to which the certificates for RG Shares in respect of which the cheque and certificates being issued were deposited, upon application to the Transfer Agent, until such time as RG has determined that delivery by mail will no longer be delayed. RG will provide notice of any such determination not to mail made hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable after the making of such determination and in accordance with this Section 8\. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Arrangement Agreement, this Plan of Arrangement and the Letter of Transmittal and Election Form, the deposit of cheques and certificates with the Transfer Agent in such circumstances will constitute delivery to the persons entitled thereto and the RG Shares will be deemed to have been paid for immediately upon such deposit.  #####

Exchangeable Shares under Section 3(1) hereof the dividends are not paid in

  (5)  |   | The Board of Directors shall determine, in good faith and in
its sole discretion, economic equivalence for the purposes of these share
provisions, including Section 3(1) hereof, and each such determination shall

the Board of Directors:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | in the case of any stock dividend or other

proportion to the number of RG Shares previously outstanding;

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (c)  |   | in the case of the issuance or distribution of any
other form of property (including any shares or securities of RG of any class
other than RG Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those
referred to in Section 3(5)(b) hereof, any evidences of indebtedness of RG or
any assets of RG), the relationship between the fair market value (as
determined by the Board of Directors in the manner above contemplated) of
such property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding RG
Share and the Current Market Price of a RG Share; and  
      
    | (d)  |   | in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of
the relevant event to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that such
consequences may differ from the taxation consequences to holders of RG
Shares as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the
United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of
differing withholding taxes and marginal taxation rates and without regard to
the individual circumstances of holders of Exchangeable Shares).  
   

  

     4.  |   | Certain Restrictions  
---|---|---

Exchangeable Shares.

B-I-9    

     5.  |   | Distribution on Liquidation  
---|---|--- 
      
  (1)  |   | In the event of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Canco or any other distribution of the assets of Canco among its shareholders
for the purpose of winding up its affairs, subject to the exercise by Callco
of the Liquidation Call Right, a holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be
entitled, subject to applicable law, to receive from the assets of Canco
in respect of each Exchangeable Share held by such holder on the effective
date (the "Liquidation Date") of such liquidation, dissolution, winding-up or
other distribution, before any distribution of any part of the assets of
Canco among the holders of the Common Shares or any other shares ranking
junior to the Exchangeable Shares, an amount per share (the
"Liquidation Amount") equal to the Current Market Price of an RG Share on the
last business day prior to the Liquidation Date plus the Dividend Amount,
which shall be satisfied in full by Canco delivering or causing to be
delivered to such holder one RG Share, plus an amount equal to the Dividend
Amount.  
      
  (2)  |   | On or promptly after the Liquidation Date, and provided the
Liquidation Call Right has not been exercised by Callco, Canco shall pay or
cause to be paid to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation
Amount for each such Exchangeable Share upon presentation and surrender of
the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with
such other documents and instruments as may be required to effect a transfer
of Exchangeable Shares under the CBCA and the Articles of Canco and such
additional documents, instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and
Canco may reasonably require, at the registered office of Canco or at any
office of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by Canco by notice to
the holders of the Exchangeable Shares. Payment of the Liquidation Amount for
such Exchangeable Shares shall be made by transferring or causing to be
transferred to each holder the RG Shares to which such holder is entitled and
by delivering to such holder, at the address of such holder recorded in the
register of shareholders of Canco for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding
for pick-up by such holder at the registered office of Canco or at any office
of the Transfer Agent as may be specified by Canco by notice to the holders
of Exchangeable Shares, on behalf of Canco, certificates representing RG
Shares (which shares shall be fully paid and shall be free and clear of any
lien, claim or encumbrance) and a cheque of Canco payable at par at any
branch of the bankers of Canco in respect of the Dividend Amount, in each case
less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and
withheld therefrom. On and after the Liquidation Date, the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect
thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement),
other than the right to receive the Liquidation Amount without interest,
unless payment of the total Liquidation Amount for such Exchangeable Shares
shall not be made upon presentation and surrender of share certificates in
accordance with the foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the
holders shall remain unaffected until the Liquidation Amount has been paid
in the manner hereinbefore provided. Canco shall have the right at any time
after the Liquidation Date to transfer or cause to be issued or transferred
to, and deposited with, the Agent the Liquidation Amount in respect of the
Exchangeable Shares represented by certificates that have not at the
Liquidation Date been surrendered by the holders thereof, such Liquidation
Amount to be held by the Agent as trustee for and on behalf of, and for the
use and benefit of, such holders. Upon such deposit being made, the rights of
a holder of  ##### 

 

 

B-I-10  

       |   | Exchangeable Shares after such deposit shall be limited
to receiving its proportionate part of the Liquidation Amount for such
Exchangeable Shares so deposited, without interest, and when received by the
Agent, all dividends and other distributions with respect to the RG Shares to
which such holder is entitled with a record date after the date of such
deposit and before the date of transfer of such RG Shares to such holder (in
each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted
and withheld therefrom) against presentation and surrender of the
certificates for the Exchangeable Shares held by them in accordance with the
foregoing provisions.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (3)  |   | After Canco has satisfied its obligations to pay the holders
of the Exchangeable Shares the Liquidation Amount per Exchangeable Share
pursuant to Section 5(1) of these share provisions, such holders shall not be
entitled to share in any further distribution of the assets of Canco.  
      
  6.  |   | Retraction of Exchangeable Shares by Holder  
      
  (1)  |   | A holder of Exchangeable Shares shall be entitled at any
time, subject to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right and
otherwise upon compliance with, and subject to, the provisions of this
Section 6, to require Canco to redeem any or all of the Exchangeable
Shares registered in the name of such holder for an amount per share equal to
the Current Market Price of a RG Share on the last business day prior to the
Retraction Date plus the Dividend Amount (the "Retraction Price"), which
shall be satisfied in full by Canco delivering or causing to be delivered to
such holder one RG Share (which on issue will be admitted to listing and
trading by the TSX and the NASDAQ Global Market (subject to official notice
of issuance)) for each Exchangeable Share presented and surrendered by the
holder together with, on the designated payment date therefor, the Dividend
Amount. To effect such redemption, the holder shall present and surrender at
the registered office of Canco or at any office of the Transfer Agent as may
be specified by Canco by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares the
certificate or certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the
holder desires to have Canco redeem, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the CBCA and the Articles of Canco and such additional documents,
instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and Canco may
reasonably require, and together with a duly executed statement (the
"Retraction Request") in the form of Schedule A hereto or in such other form
as may be acceptable to Canco:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | specifying that the holder desires to have all or
any number specified therein of the Exchangeable Shares represented by such
certificate or certificates (the "Retracted Shares") redeemed by Canco;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | stating the business day on which the holder desires to
have Canco redeem the Retracted Shares (the "Retraction Date"), provided that
the Retraction Date shall be not less than 10 business days nor more than 15
business days after the date on which the Retraction Request is received by
Canco and further provided that, in the event that no such business day is
specified by the holder in the Retraction Request, the Retraction Date shall
be deemed to be the 15th business day after the date on which the Retraction
Request is received by Canco and subject also to Section 6(8); and  ##### 

 

 

B-I-11  

       | (c)  |   | acknowledging the overriding right (the
"Retraction Call Right") of Callco to purchase all but not less than all the
Retracted Shares directly from the holder and that the Retraction Request
shall be deemed to be a revocable offer by the holder to sell the Retracted
Shares to Callco in accordance with the Retraction Call Right on the terms
and conditions set out in Section 6(3) hereof.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     (2)  |   | Provided that Callco has not exercised the Retraction
Call Right, upon receipt by Canco or the Transfer Agent in the manner
specified in Section 6(1) of a certificate or certificates representing the
number of Retracted Shares, together with a Retraction Request, and
provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the
manner specified in Section 6(7), Canco shall redeem the Retracted Shares
effective at the close of business on the Retraction Date and shall transfer
or cause to be issued or transferred to such holder the RG Shares to which
such holder is entitled and shall comply with Section 6(4) hereof. If only
a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate is redeemed
(or purchased by Callco pursuant to the Retraction Call Right), a new
certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares shall be issued to
the holder at the expense of Canco.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (3)  |   | Subject to the provisions of this Section 6, upon receipt by
Canco of a Retraction Request, Canco shall immediately notify Callco thereof
and shall provide to Callco a copy of the Retraction Request. In order to
exercise the Retraction Call Right, Callco must notify Canco of its
determination to do so (the "Callco Call Notice") within five business days
of notification to Callco by Canco of the receipt by Canco of the Retraction
Request. If Callco does not so notify Canco within such five business day
period, Canco will notify the holder as soon as possible thereafter that
Callco will not exercise the Retraction Call Right. If Callco delivers the
Callco Call Notice within such five business day period, and provided that
the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the manner specified
in Section 6(7), the Retraction Request shall thereupon be considered only to
be an offer by the holder to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco in
accordance with the Retraction Call Right. In such event, Canco shall not
redeem the Retracted Shares and Callco shall purchase from such holder and
such holder shall sell to Callco on the Retraction Date the Retracted Shares
for a purchase price (the "Purchase Price") per share equal to the Retraction
Price per share. To the extent that Callco pays the Dividend Amount in
respect of the Retracted Shares, Canco shall no longer be obligated to pay
any declared and unpaid dividends on such Retracted Shares. For the
purpose of completing a purchase pursuant to the Retraction Call Right, on
the Retraction Date, Callco shall transfer or cause to be issued or
transferred to the holder of the Retracted Shares the RG Shares to which such
holder is entitled. Provided that Callco has complied with the immediately
preceding sentence and Section 6(4) hereof, the closing of the purchase and
sale of the Retracted Shares pursuant to the Retraction Call Right shall be
deemed to have occurred as at the close of business on the Retraction Date
and, for greater certainty, no redemption by Canco of such Retracted Shares
shall take place on the Retraction Date. In the event that Callco does not
deliver a Callco Call Notice within such five business day period,
and provided that the Retraction Request is not revoked by the holder in the
manner specified in Section 6(7), Canco shall redeem the Retracted Shares on
the Retraction Date and in the manner otherwise contemplated in this Section
6.  
      
  (4)  |   | Canco or Callco, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause
the Transfer Agent to deliver to the relevant holder, at the address of the
holder recorded in the register of shareholders of  ##### 

 

 

B-I-12  

     |   | Canco for the Exchangeable Shares or at the address specified
in the holders Retraction Request or by holding for pick-up by the holder at

be specified by Canco by notice to the holders of Exchangeable Shares,
certificates representing the RG Shares (which shares shall be fully paid and
shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance and which on issue
will be admitted to listing and trading by the TSX and the NASDAQ Global
Market (subject to official notice of issuance)) registered in the name of
the holder or in such other name as the holder may request, and, if
applicable and on or before the payment date therefor, a cheque payable at
par at any branch of the bankers of Canco or Callco, as
applicable, representing the aggregate Dividend Amount, in payment of the
Retraction Price or the Purchase Price, as the case may be, in each case less
any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom, and such delivery of such certificates and cheques on behalf of
Canco or by Callco, as the case may be, or by the Transfer Agent shall be
deemed to be payment of and shall satisfy and discharge all liability for the
Retraction Price or Purchase Price, as the case may be, to the extent that
the same is represented by such share certificates and cheques (plus any tax
deducted and withheld therefrom and remitted to the proper tax authority).  
---|---|--- 
  
   (5)  |   | On and after the close of business on the Retraction Date,
the holder of the Retracted Shares shall cease to be a holder of such
Retracted Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a
holder in respect thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement), other than the right to receive the Retraction Price or
Purchase Price, as the case may be, without interest, unless upon
presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the foregoing
provisions, payment of the Retraction Price or the Purchase Price, as the
case may be, shall not be made as provided in Section 6(4) hereof, in which
case the rights of such holder shall remain unaffected until the Retraction
Price or the Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been paid in the manner
hereinbefore provided. On and after the close of business on the Retraction
Date, provided that presentation and surrender of certificates and payment of
the Retraction Price or the Purchase Price, as the case may be, has been made
in accordance with the foregoing provisions, the holder of the Retracted
Shares so redeemed by Canco or purchased by Callco shall thereafter be a
holder of the RG Shares delivered to it.  
      
  (6)  |   | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6, Canco
shall not be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent that such redemption of Retracted Shares
would be contrary to solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable
law. If Canco believes that on any Retraction Date it would not be permitted
by any of such provisions to redeem the Retracted Shares tendered for
redemption on such date, and provided that Callco shall not have exercised
the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, Canco shall
only be obligated to redeem Retracted Shares specified by a holder in a
Retraction Request to the extent of the maximum number that may be so
redeemed (rounded down to a whole number of shares) as would not be contrary
to such provisions and shall notify the holder and the Trustee at least two
business days prior to the Retraction Date as to the number of Retracted
Shares which will not be redeemed by Canco. In any case in which the
redemption by Canco of Retracted Shares would be contrary to solvency
requirements or other provisions of applicable law, Canco shall redeem
Retracted Shares in accordance with Section 6(2) of these share provisions on ##### 

 

 

B-I-13  

     |   | pro rata basis and shall issue to each holder of Retracted
Shares a new certificate, at the expense of Canco, representing the Retracted
Shares not redeemed by Canco pursuant to Section 6(2) hereof. If Canco would
otherwise be obligated to redeem the Retracted Shares pursuant to Section
6(2) of these share provisions but is not obligated to do so as a result of
solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law, the holder of any
such Retracted Shares not redeemed by Canco pursuant to this Section 6 as a
result of solvency requirements or other provisions of applicable law shall
be deemed by giving the Retraction Request to have instructed the Transfer
Agent to require RG to purchase such Retracted Shares from such holder on the
Retraction Date or as soon as practicable thereafter on payment by RG to such
holder of the Purchase Price for each such Retracted Share, all as more
specifically provided for in the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement.  
---|---|--- 
  
   (7)  |   | A holder of Retracted Shares may, by notice in writing
given by the holder to Canco before the close of business on the business day
immediately preceding the Retraction Date, withdraw its Retraction Request,
in which event such Retraction Request shall be null and void and,
for greater certainty, the revocable offer constituted by the Retraction
Request to sell the Retracted Shares to Callco shall be deemed to have been
revoked.  
      
  (8)  |   | Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6, if:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | exercise of the rights of the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares, or any of them, to require Canco to redeem any
Exchangeable Shares pursuant to this Section 6 on any Retraction Date would
require listing particulars or any similar document to be issued in order to
obtain the approval of the TSX or the NASDAQ Global Market to the listing and
trading (subject to official notice of issuance) of, the RG Shares that would
be required to be delivered to such holders of Exchangeable Shares in
connection with the exercise of such rights; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | as a result of (a) above, it would not be practicable
(notwithstanding the reasonable endeavours of RG) to obtain such approvals in
time to enable all or any of such RG Shares to be admitted to listing and
trading by the TSX and the NASDAQ Global Market (subject to official notice
of issuance) when so delivered,  
   

  

       |   | that Retraction Date shall, notwithstanding any other
date specified or otherwise deemed to be specified in any relevant Retraction
Request, be deemed for all purposes to be the earlier of (i) the second
business day immediately following the date the approvals referred to in
Section 6(8)(a) are obtained, and (ii) the date which is 30 business days
after the date on which the relevant Retraction Request is received by Canco,
and references in these share provisions to such Retraction Date shall be
construed accordingly.  
---|---|--- 
      
  7.  |   | Redemption of Exchangeable Shares by Canco  
      
  (1)  |   | Subject to applicable law, and provided Callco has not
exercised the Redemption Call Right, Canco shall on the Redemption Date
redeem all but not less than all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares
for an amount per share (the "Redemption Price") equal to the Current Market
Price of a RG Share on the last business day prior to the Redemption Date plus
the Dividend Amount, which shall be satisfied in full by Canco causing to be
delivered  ##### 

 

 

B-I-14  

     |   | to each holder of Exchangeable Shares one RG Share for each
Exchangeable Share held by such holder, together with an amount equal to the
Dividend Amount.  
---|---|--- 
  
   (2)  |   | In any case of a redemption of Exchangeable Shares under
this Section 7, Canco shall, at least 60 days before the Redemption Date
(other than a Redemption Date established in connection with a RG Control
Transaction, an Exchangeable Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable
Share Voting Event), send or cause to be sent to each holder of
Exchangeable Shares a notice in writing of the redemption by Canco or the
purchase by Callco under the Redemption Call Right, as the case may be, of
the Exchangeable Shares held by such holder. In the case of a Redemption Date
established in connection with a RG Control Transaction, an Exchangeable
Share Voting Event or an Exempt Exchangeable Share Voting Event, the
written notice of the redemption by Canco or the purchase by Callco under the
Redemption Call Right will be sent on or before the Redemption Date, on as
many days prior written notice as may be determined by the Board of Directors
to be reasonably practicable in the circumstances. In any such case, such
notice shall set out the formula for determining the Redemption Price or
the Redemption Call Purchase Price, as the case may be, the Redemption Date
and, if applicable, particulars of the Redemption Call Right.  
      
  (3)  |   | On or after the Redemption Date and provided that the
Redemption Call Right has not been exercised by Callco, Canco shall pay or
cause to be paid to the holders of the Exchangeable Shares to be redeemed the
Redemption Price for each such Exchangeable Share, upon presentation and
surrender at the registered office of Canco or at any office of the Transfer
Agent as may be specified by Canco in such notice of the certificates
representing such Exchangeable Shares, together with such other documents and
instruments as may be required to effect a transfer of Exchangeable Shares
under the CBCA and the Articles of Canco and such additional documents,
instruments and payments as the Transfer Agent and Canco may reasonably
require. Payment of the Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall
be made by transferring or causing to be issued or transferred to each holder
the RG Shares to which such holder is entitled and by delivering to such
holder, at the address of such holder recorded in the register of
shareholders of Canco for the Exchangeable Shares or by holding for pick-up
by such holder at the registered office of Canco or at any office of the
Transfer Agent as may be specified by Canco in such notice, on behalf of
Canco certificates representing RG Shares (which shares shall be fully paid
and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance), and, if
applicable, a cheque of Canco payable at par at any branch of the bankers of
Canco in payment of the Dividend Amount, in each case less any amounts
withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld therefrom. On
and after the Redemption Date, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares called
for redemption shall cease to be holders of such Exchangeable Shares and
shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of holders in respect
thereof (including any rights under the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement),
other than the right to receive the Redemption Price without interest, unless
payment of the Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares shall not be
made upon presentation and surrender of certificates in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders shall remain
unaffected until the Redemption Price has been paid in the manner
hereinbefore provided. Canco shall have the right at any time after the
sending of notice of its intention to redeem the Exchangeable Shares as
aforesaid to transfer or cause to be issued or transferred to, and deposited
with, the Agent named in such notice the Redemption Price for the
Exchangeable Shares so called for  ##### 

 

 

B-I-15  

     |   | redemption, or of such of the said Exchangeable Shares
represented by certificates that have not at the date of such deposit been
surrendered by the holders thereof in connection with such redemption, less
any amounts withheld on account of tax required to be deducted and withheld
therefrom, such aggregate Redemption Price to be held by the Agent as trustee
for and on behalf of, and for the use and benefit of, such holders. Upon the
later of such deposit being made and the Redemption Date, the Exchangeable
Shares in respect whereof such deposit shall have been made shall be redeemed
and the rights of the holders thereof after such deposit or Redemption Date,
as the case may be, shall be limited to receiving their proportionate part of
the aggregate Redemption Price for such Exchangeable Shares,
without interest, and when received by the Agent, all dividends and other
distributions with respect to the RG Shares to which such holder is entitled
with a record date after the later of the date of such deposit and the
Redemption Date and before the date of transfer of such RG Shares to such
holder (in each case less any amounts withheld on account of tax required
to be deducted and withheld therefrom), against presentation and surrender of
the certificates for the Exchangeable Shares held by them in accordance with
the foregoing provisions.  
---|---|--- 
  
   8.  |   | Purchase for Cancellation  
   

  

 Subject to applicable law, Canco may at any time and from time to time purchase for cancellation all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares. 

   

     9.  |   | Voting Rights  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 Except as required by applicable law and by Section 13 hereof, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not be entitled as such to receive notice of or to attend any meeting of the shareholders of Canco or to vote at any such meeting. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the holders of the Exchangeable Shares shall not have class votes except as required by applicable law. 

   

     10.  |   | Specified Amount  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 The amount specified in respect of each Exchangeable Share for the purposes of subsection 191(4) of the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) shall be an amount equal to $. 

   

     11.  |   | Election under Subsection 191.2(1)  
---|---|--- 
   

  

 Canco shall make an election under subsection 191.2(1) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of the Exchangeable Shares in the manner and within the time required by such subsection. 

   

     12.  |   | Amendment and Approval  
---|---|--- 
   

  

     (1)  |   | The rights, privileges, restrictions and conditions
attaching to the Exchangeable Shares may be added to, changed or removed only
with the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares given as
hereinafter specified.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (2)  |   | Any approval given by the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
to add to, change or remove any right, privilege, restriction or condition
attaching to the Exchangeable Shares or any other matter requiring the
approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares in  ##### 

 

 

B-I-16  

       |   | accordance with applicable law shall be deemed to have
been sufficiently given if it shall have been given in accordance with
applicable law, subject to a minimum requirement that such approval be
evidenced by resolution passed by not less than two-thirds of the votes cast
on such resolution at a meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares duly called
and held at which the holders of at least 10% of the outstanding Exchangeable
Shares at that time are present or represented by proxy; provided that if at
any such meeting the holders of at least 10% of the outstanding Exchangeable
Shares at that time are not present or represented by proxy within one-half
hour after the time appointed for such meeting, then the meeting shall be
adjourned to such date not less than five days thereafter and to such time
and place as may be designated by the Chairman of such meeting. At such
adjourned meeting the holders of Exchangeable Shares present or represented
by proxy thereat may transact the business for which the meeting was
originally called and a resolution passed thereat by the affirmative vote of
not less than two-thirds of the votes cast on such resolution at such meeting
shall constitute the approval or consent of the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares.

     13.  |   | Reciprocal Changes, etc. in Respect of RG Shares  
---|---|--- 
      
  (1)  |   | Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the
Support Agreement provides, in part, that so long as any Exchangeable Shares
not owned by RG or its affiliates are outstanding, RG will not without the
prior approval of Canco and the prior approval of the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 12(2) of these
share provisions:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | issue or distribute RG Shares (or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire RG Shares)
to the holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding RG Shares
by way of stock dividend or other distribution, other than an issue of RG
Shares (or securities exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights
to acquire RG Shares) to holders of RG Shares (i) who exercise an option to
receive dividends in RG Shares (or securities exchangeable for or
convertible into or carrying rights to acquire RG Shares) in lieu of
receiving cash dividends, or (ii) pursuant to any dividend reinvestment plan
or similar arrangement;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | issue or distribute rights, options or warrants to the
holders of all or substantially all of the then outstanding RG Shares
entitling them to subscribe for or to purchase RG Shares (or securities
exchangeable for or convertible into or carrying rights to acquire RG
Shares); or  
      
    | (c)  |   | issue or distribute to the holders of all or
substantially all of the then outstanding RG Shares:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | shares or securities of RG of any class (other
than RG Shares or securities convertible into or exchangeable for or carrying
rights to acquire RG Shares);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | rights, options or warrants other than those referred
to in Section 13(1)(b) above;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | evidence of indebtedness of RG; or  ##### 

 

 

B-I-17  

       | (iv)  |   | assets of RG,  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       |   | unless the economic equivalent on a per share basis of
such rights, options, securities, shares, evidences of indebtedness or other
assets is issued or distributed simultaneously to holders of the Exchangeable
Shares and at least 7 days prior written notice thereof is given to the
holders of Exchangeable Shares; provided that, for greater certainty, the
above restrictions shall not apply to any securities issued or distributed by
RG in order to give effect to and to consummate, in furtherance of or
otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by, and in
accordance with, the Plan of Arrangement.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (2)  |   | Each holder of an Exchangeable Share acknowledges that the
Support Agreement further provides, in part, that so long as any Exchangeable
Shares not owned by RG or its affiliates are outstanding, RG will not without
the prior approval of Canco and the prior approval of the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 12(2) of these
share provisions:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | subdivide, redivide or change the then
outstanding RG Shares into a greater number of RG Shares;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | reduce, combine, consolidate or change the then
outstanding RG Shares into a lesser number of RG Shares; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | reclassify or otherwise change the RG Shares or effect
an amalgamation, merger, reorganization or other transaction affecting the RG
Shares,  
   

  

       |   | unless the same or an economically equivalent change
shall simultaneously be made to, or in the rights of the holders of, the
Exchangeable Shares and at least 7 days prior written notice is given to the
holders of Exchangeable Shares. The Support Agreement further provides, in
part, that the aforesaid provisions of the Support Agreement shall not
be changed without the approval of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares
given in accordance with Section 12(2) of these share provisions.

  (3)  |   | Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 13,
in the event of an RG Control Transaction:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | in which RG merges or amalgamates with, or in
which all or substantially all of the then outstanding RG Shares are acquired
by one or more other corporations to which RG is, immediately before such
merger, amalgamation or acquisition, related within the meaning of the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada) (otherwise than virtue of a right referred to
in paragraph 251(5)(b) thereof);  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | which does not result in an acceleration of the
Redemption Date in accordance with paragraph (b) of the definition of such
term in Section 1(1) of the share provisions; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | in which all or substantially all of the then
outstanding RG Shares are converted into or exchanged for shares or rights to
receive such shares (the "Other Shares") of  #####

       |   |   | another corporation (the "Other Corporation") that,
immediately after such RG Control Transaction, owns or controls, directly or
indirectly, RG;

then all references herein to "RG" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be
references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to "RG Shares"
shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other Shares" (with
appropriate adjustments, if any, as are required to result in a holder of
Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of shares

retraction of such shares pursuant to these share provisions or Section 5 of
the Plan of Arrangement, or exchange of such shares pursuant to the Voting
and Exchange Trust Agreement had occurred immediately prior to the RG Control
Transaction and the RG Control Transaction was completed) without any need to

compliance by RG, Callco and Canco with all provisions of the Support
Agreement applicable to RG, Callco and Canco, respectively, in accordance
with the terms thereof including taking all such actions and doing all such
things as shall be necessary to enforce for the direct benefit of Canco all
rights and benefits in favour of Canco under or pursuant to such agreement.  
      
  (2)  |   | Canco shall not propose, agree to or otherwise give effect to
any amendment to, or waiver or forgiveness of its rights or obligations
under, the Support Agreement without the approval of the holders of the
Exchangeable Shares given in accordance with Section 12(2) of these
share provisions other than such amendments, waivers and/or forgiveness as
may be necessary or advisable for the purposes of:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | adding to the covenants of the other parties to
such agreement for the protection of Canco or the holders of the Exchangeable
Shares thereunder;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | making such amendments or modifications not
inconsistent with such agreement as may be necessary or desirable with
respect to matters or questions arising thereunder which, in the good faith
opinion of the Board of Directors, it may be expedient to make, provided that
the Board of Directors shall be of the good faith opinion, after consultation
with counsel, that such amendments and modifications will not be prejudicial
to the interests of the holders of the Exchangeable Shares; or  
      
    | (c)  |   | making such changes in or corrections to such agreement
which, on the advice of counsel to Canco, are required for the purpose of
curing or correcting any ambiguity or defect or inconsistent provision or

     15.  |   | Legend; Call Rights; Withholding Rights  
---|---|--- 
      
  (1)  |   | The certificates evidencing the Exchangeable Shares shall
contain or have affixed thereto a legend in form and on terms approved by the
Board of Directors, with respect to the Support Agreement, the provisions of
the Plan of Arrangement relating to the Liquidation Call Right, the
Redemption Call Right and the Change of Law Call Right, the Voting and
Exchange Trust Agreement (including the provisions with respect to the voting
rights and automatic exchange thereunder) and the Retraction Call Right.  
      
  (2)  |   | Each holder of an Exchangeable Share, whether of record or
beneficial, by virtue of becoming and being such a holder shall be deemed to
acknowledge each of the Liquidation Call Right, the Retraction Call Right and
the Redemption Call Right, in each case, in favour of Callco, and the Change
of Law Call Right in favour of RG and Callco, and the overriding nature
thereof in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of
Canco or any other distribution of the assets of Canco among its shareholders
for the purpose of winding up its affairs, or the retraction or redemption of
Exchangeable Shares, as the case may be, and to be bound thereby in favour of
Callco as therein provided.  
      
  (3)  |   | Canco, Callco, RG and the Transfer Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any dividend, distribution or consideration
otherwise payable to any holder of Exchangeable Shares such amounts as Canco,
Callco, RG or the Transfer Agent is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) or United States
tax laws or any provision of provincial, territorial, state, local or foreign
tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld
amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing Agency. To the extent
that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a
holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the
holder, Canco, Callco, RG and the Transfer Agent are hereby authorized to
sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as
is necessary to provide sufficient funds to Canco, Callco, RG or the Transfer
Agent, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or
withholding requirement and Canco, Callco, RG or the Transfer Agent shall
notify the holder thereof and remit any unapplied balance of the net proceeds
of such sale.

telecopy or by delivery to the registered office of Canco and addressed to
the attention of the Secretary of Canco. Any such notice, request or
other communication, if given by mail, telecopy or delivery, shall only be
deemed to have been given and received upon actual receipt thereof by
Canco.

Shares to Canco or the Transfer Agent of certificates representing
Exchangeable Shares in connection with the liquidation, dissolution or
winding-up of Canco or the retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares  #####

delivery to the registered office of Canco or to such office of the Transfer
Agent as may be specified by Canco, in each case, addressed to the attention
of the Secretary of Canco. Any such presentation and surrender
of certificates shall only be deemed to have been made and to be effective
upon actual receipt thereof by Canco or the Transfer Agent, as the case may
be. Any such presentation and surrender of certificates made by first class
mail (postage prepaid) shall be at the sole risk of the holder mailing the
same.  
---|---|--- 
      
  (3)  |   | Any notice, request or other communication to be given to a
holder of Exchangeable Shares by or on behalf of Canco shall be in writing
and shall be valid and effective if given by first class mail (postage
prepaid) or by delivery to the address of the holder recorded in the register
of shareholders of Canco or, in the event of the address of any such holder
not being so recorded, then at the last known address of such holder. Any
such notice, request or other communication, if given by mail, shall be
deemed to have been given and received on the third business day following
the date of mailing and, if given by delivery, shall be deemed to have been
given and received on the date of delivery. Accidental failure or omission to
give any notice, request or other communication to one or more holders of
Exchangeable Shares shall not invalidate or otherwise alter or affect any
action or proceeding to be taken by Canco pursuant thereto.  
      
  (4)  |   | In the event of any interruption of mail service immediately
prior to a scheduled mailing or in the period following a mailing during
which delivery normally would be expected to occur, Canco shall make
reasonable efforts to disseminate any notice by other means, such
as publication. Except as otherwise required or permitted by law, if post
offices in Canada are not open for the deposit of mail, any notice which
Canco or the Transfer Agent may give or cause to be given hereunder will be
deemed to have been properly given and to have been received by holders of
Exchangeable Shares if (i) it is given to the TSX for dissemination or (ii)
it is published once in the national edition of _The Globe and Mail_ and in
the daily newspapers of general circulation in each of the French and English
languages in the City of Montreal, provided that if the national edition of
_The Globe and Mail_ is not being generally circulated, publication thereof
will be made in the _National Post_ or any other daily newspaper of general
circulation published in the City of Toronto.  
      
    |   | Notwithstanding any other provisions of these share provisions,
notices, other communications and deliveries need not be mailed if Canco
determines that delivery thereof by mail may be delayed. Persons entitled to
any deliveries (including certificates and cheques) which are not mailed for
the foregoing reason may take delivery thereof at the office of the Transfer
Agent to which the deliveries were made, upon application to the Transfer
Agent, until such time as Canco has determined that delivery by mail will
not longer be delayed. Canco will provide notice of any such determination
not to mail made hereunder as soon as reasonably practicable after the making
of such determination and in accordance with this Section 16(4). Such
deliveries in such circumstances will constitute delivery to the persons
entitled thereto.  #####

 The undersigned hereby notifies Canco that, subject to the Retraction Call Right referred to below, the undersigned desires to have Canco redeem in accordance with Section 6 of the Share Provisions:

 The undersigned acknowledges that if, as a result of solvency provisions of applicable law, Canco is unable to redeem all Retracted Shares, and provided that Callco has not exercised the Retraction Call Right with respect to the Retracted Shares, the Retracted Shares will be automatically exchanged pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement so as to require RG to purchase the unredeemed Retracted Shares.

SCHEDULE F 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF TARGET  

  

 Target represents and warrants to Acquireco as follows (and acknowledges that Acquireco is relying on such representations and warranties in entering into this agreement and completing the Transactions): 

  

       | (a)  |   | Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each
of Target and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or other
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the requisite power
and authority to own its assets and conduct its business as currently owned
and conducted. Each of Target and each of its Subsidiaries is duly qualified
or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in
which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing of
its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary. Target has
made available for review by Acquireco complete and correct copies of its
Articles of Continuance and By-Laws and the certificates of incorporation and
bylaws or comparable organization documents of the Subsidiaries of Target, in
each case as amended to the date of this agreement. Target is not in
violation of any provision of its Articles of Continuance or By-Laws, and no
Subsidiary of Target is in violation of any provisions of its certificate of
incorporation, by-laws or comparable organizational documents.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Target Subsidiaries. Section (b) of the Target
Disclosure Statement lists each Subsidiary of Target and the ownership or
interest therein of Target. All the outstanding shares of capital stock of
each such Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-
assessable and, except as set forth in Section (b) of the Target Disclosure
Statement, are owned by Target, by another Subsidiary of Target or by Target
and another Subsidiary of Target, free and clear of all pledges, claims,
liens, charges, mortgages, deeds of trust, net profit interests, net smelter
returns, royalties, overriding royalty interests, other payments out of
production, other burdens, security interests and other encumbrances of any
kind or nature whatsoever held by third parties (collectively, "Liens").
Except for the capital stock of the Subsidiaries of Target and except for the
ownership interests set forth in Section (b) of the Target Disclosure
Statement, Target does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or
other ownership interest.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Capitalization. The authorized capital (the "Authorized
Capital") and issued capital of Target is as set out in the recitals to this
agreement. Except as set forth above, there are no shares of capital stock or
other voting securities of Target issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. Except as set forth in Section (c) of the Target Disclosure
Statement, there are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness
of Target having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which shareholders
of Target must vote. Except as set forth above and except as set forth in
Section (c) of the Target Disclosure Statement, as of the date of this
agreement,   
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

  

F-2 

   

       |   |   | there are not any options, warrants, puts, calls,
rights, commitments, agreements, arrangements or undertakings of any kind
(collectively, "Options") to which Target or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party or by which any of them is bound relating to the issued or unissued
capital stock of Target or any of its Subsidiaries, or obligating Target or
any of its Subsidiaries to issue, transfer, grant, sell or pay for or
repurchase any shares of capital stock or other equity interests in,
or securities convertible or exchangeable for any capital stock or other
equity interests in, Target or any of its Subsidiaries or obligating Target
or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such
Options. All shares of Targets capital stock that are subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instrument pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. The issuance and sale of all
of the shares of capital stock described in this Section (c) of Schedule F
have been in compliance with all Laws. Target has previously provided
Acquireco with a schedule setting forth the names of, and the number of
shares of each class (including the number of shares issuable upon exercise
of Target Options and the exercise price and vesting schedule with
respect thereto) and the number of options held by, all holders of Target
Options. Section (c) of the Target Disclosure Statement sets forth the
average exercise price for outstanding Target Options. Except as set forth in
Section (c) of the Target Disclosure Statement, Target has not agreed to
register any securities under any securities Laws or granted registration
rights to any person or entity; copies of all such agreements have previously
been made available to Acquireco. Except as set forth above and in Section
(c) of the Target Disclosure Statement, as of the date of this agreement,
there are not any outstanding contractual obligations or other requirements
of Target or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Target or any of its
Subsidiaries, or provide funds to or make any investment (in the form of a
loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of Target or any
other person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, there are no
stock appreciation rights, phantom equity or similar rights, agreements,
arrangements or commitments based upon the book value, income or any other
attribute of Target or any of its Subsidiaries.

    | (d)  |   | Authority; Non-Contravention.  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | Target has all requisite corporate power and
corporate authority to enter into this agreement and, subject to the
Target Securityholder Approval, to consummate the Transactions and to perform
its obligations under this agreement. On December 16, 2009, the board of
directors of Target unanimously approved this agreement and the Transactions
and resolved to recommend to Target Shareholders that Target Shareholders
give the Target Securityholder Approval. The execution and delivery of this
agreement by Target and the consummation by Target of the Transactions have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Target,
subject to the Target Securityholder Approval. No other corporate proceedings
on the part of Target or any of its Subsidiaries are necessary   
---|---|---|--- 
  

  ##### 

  

  

    

  

F-3 

   

       |   |   | to authorize this agreement, the performance by
Target of its obligations under this agreement and, subject to the Target
Securityholder Approval, the Transactions. This agreement has been duly
executed and delivered by Target and constitutes a valid and binding
obligation of Target, enforceable by Acquireco against Target and each of its
Subsidiaries in accordance with its terms, subject to the availability of
equitable remedies and the enforcement of creditors rights generally. The
execution and delivery of this agreement does not, and the consummation of
the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this agreement will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
first refusal, consent, termination, buyback, purchase, cancellation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of any property, rights or benefits
under, or result in the imposition of any additional obligation under, or
result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of
Target or any of its Subsidiaries under, (i) the Articles of Continuance or
By-Laws of Target or the comparable organization documents of any of its
Subsidiaries; (ii) any contract, royalty, instrument, permit, concession,
franchise, license, loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease or other property agreement, partnership or joint venture
agreement or other legally binding agreement, arrangement or understanding
whether oral or written (a "Contract"), to which Target or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of them or their respective
properties or assets is bound or affected, or (iii) subject to the
governmental filings and other matters referred to in the following sentence,
any Law applicable to Target or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets. No consent, approval, order or authorization of, or
registration, declaration or filing with, any Agency, is required by or with

and delivery of this agreement by Target or the consummation by Target of the
Transactions, except for (i) the filing with the applicable securities
regulatory Agencies of the Target Circular, (ii) any approvals required by
the Interim Order and the Final Order, (iii) filings with the Director under

certificates, franchises, licenses, permits, grants, easements, covenants,
certificates, orders, authorizations and approvals issued to or granted by
Agencies or other third parties (collectively, "Permits") necessary to
conduct its business as such business is currently conducted or is expected
to be conducted following completion of the Transaction, except where the
failure to possess such Permits would not be Materially Adverse to the Target
and its Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section (d) of the Target
Disclosure Statement, (i) all such Permits are validly held by Target or its
Subsidiaries, and Target and its Subsidiaries have complied in all respects  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

F-4 

   

       |   |   | with all terms and conditions thereof, (ii) none of
such Permits will be subject to suspension, modification, revocation or non-
renewal as a result of the execution and delivery of this agreement or the
consummation of the Transactions, and (iii) since December 31, 2008, neither
Target nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice, notice of
violation or probable violation, notice of revocation, or other written
communication from or on behalf of any Agency, alleging (A) any violation of
such Permit, or (B) that Target or any of its Subsidiaries requires any
Permit required for its business as such business is currently conducted,
that is not currently held by it.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (e)  |   | Publicly Filed Documents; Undisclosed
Liabilities. Target has filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including documents incorporated by
reference) with the applicable security regulatory Agencies since January 1,
2006 (the "Target Public Disclosure Documents"). As of its date, each
Target Public Disclosure Document complied in all material respects with the
requirements of all applicable securities Law. None of the Target Public
Disclosure Documents, as of their respective dates, contained any untrue
statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except
to the extent that such statements have been modified or superseded by a
later-filed Target Public Disclosure Document. The consolidated
financial statements of Target included in the Target Public Disclosure
Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the
applicable securities regulatory Agencies with respect thereto, have been
prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly
present the consolidated financial position of Target as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end audit adjustments). Except (i) as and to the extent disclosed,
reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet or the notes thereto of
Target as of December 31, 2008 included in the Filed Target Public Disclosure
Documents, as incurred after the date thereof in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice and prohibited by this agreement or
(ii) as set forth in Section (e) of the Target Disclosure Statement, Target
does not have any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether known
or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise and whether due or to
become due, that, individually or in the aggregate, have had or would
reasonably be expected to have a Materially Adverse effect on Target and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Except as set forth in Section (e) of the
Target Disclosure Statement, none of Target or its Subsidiaries is subject to
the informational reporting requirements of, or required to file any form or
other document with, any securities regulatory Agency (including any stock
exchange).

F-5 

   

       | (f)  |   | Information Supplied. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Target or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Target Circular or any other filings
relating to the Transactions will, at the date the Target Circular is first
mailed to Target Securityholders, or at the time of the Target Special
Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. The Target Circular will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of applicable securities Law, except that no
representation or warranty is made by Target with respect to statements made
or incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by
Acquireco for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Target
Circular.

caused each of its Subsidiaries to conduct, its business only in the ordinary
course and:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | there has not been any event, change, effect or
development (including any decision to implement such a change made by the
board of directors of Target or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of which
senior management believes that confirmation of the board of directors is
probable), which, individually or in the aggregate, has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, a Materially Adverse effect on Target and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | there has not been, except for regular annual
dividends not in excess of $0.04 per Target Share, with customary record and
payment dates, any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or
other distribution (whether in cash, stock or property) with respect to any
Target Shares;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | there has not been any split, combination or
reclassification of any Authorized Capital of Target or any issuance or the
authorization of any issuance of any other securities in exchange or in
substitution for shares of Authorized Capital of Target;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | there has not been, except as disclosed in Section (g)
of the Target Disclosure Statement, (A) any granting by Target or any of
its Subsidiaries to any officer of Target or any of its Subsidiaries of
any increase in or acceleration of compensation, (B) any granting by Target
or any of its Subsidiaries to any such officer of any increase in severance
or termination pay, or (C) any entry by Target or any of its Subsidiaries

payment or benefit to any employee, consultant, officer or director of Target

beneficiaries thereof or any third party.

Section (s) of the Target Disclosure Statement, there is no suit, action or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of Target, threatened against Target
or any of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, if
adversely determined, would reasonably be expected to have a Materially
Adverse effect on Target and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and there is
not any judgement, decree, injunction, rule or order of any Agency
or arbitrator outstanding against Target or any of its Subsidiaries having,
or which would reasonably be expected to have, any Materially Adverse effect

held on December 16, 2009:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | that the entering into of this agreement, the
performance by Target of its obligations hereunder and the Transactions are
in the best interests of Target and its shareholders;

Agreement) with notice in writing of such extension, under the Target Rights
Agreement until after the vote by the Target Shareholders on the Arrangement
at the Target Special Meeting;  
      
    | (v)  |   | to recommend that Target Shareholders approve the
Arrangement; and  
      
    | (vi)  |   | to recommend that Target Shareholders waive the Target
Rights Agreement so that neither the entering into nor delivery of this
agreement, the Arrangement or the other agreements contemplated hereby nor
the consummation of all or any part of the Transactions shall constitute a
Flip-in Event (as defined in the Target Rights Agreement).  
      
    |   |   | To the knowledge of Target, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, no provincial or state take-over statute or similar
statute or regulation (including Multilateral Instrument 61-101  _Protection

SCHEDULE G 
 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ACQUIRECO AND CANCO 

   

 Acquireco and Canco jointly and severally represent and warrant to Target as follows (and acknowledge that Target is relying on such representations and warranties in entering this agreement and completing the Transactions): 

  

       | (a)  |   | Organization, Standing and Corporate Power. Each
of Acquireco and each of its Subsidiaries is a corporation, partnership or
other legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has the
requisite power and authority to own its assets and conduct its business as
currently owned and conducted. Each of Acquireco and each of its Subsidiaries
is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification or licensing necessary. Acquireco
has made available for review to Target complete and correct copies of its
Certificate of Incorporation and the certificates of incorporation or
comparable organization documents of the Subsidiaries of Acquireco, in each
case as amended to the date of this agreement. Acquireco is not in violation
of any provision of its Certificate of Incorporation or By-Laws, and no
Subsidiary of Acquireco is in violation of any provisions of its certificate
of incorporation, by-laws or comparable organizational documents.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Acquireco Subsidiaries. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each Subsidiary of Acquireco have been validly issued and
are fully paid and non-assessable. Canco is an indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of Acquireco.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Capitalization. The authorized capital of Acquireco
consists of (i) 100,000,000 Acquireco Shares, of which 40,996,905 were issued
and outstanding as of the close of business on December 16, 2009, and (ii)
10,000,000 shares of $0.01 par value Preferred Stock, of which none were
outstanding as of the close of business on December 16, 2009. As of December
16, 2009, (i) 383,740 Acquireco Shares were reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding stock options that were granted pursuant
to Acquirecos stock option plan, (ii) 102,140 Acquireco Shares were reserved
for issuance upon the vesting of outstanding stock appreciation rights
granted by Acquireco, and (iii) 154,250 Acquireco Shares were reserved for
issuance upon the vesting of performance shares and continued service shares
granted by Acquireco to management and employees. Except as set forth above,
there are no shares of capital stock or other voting securities of Acquireco
issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. There are not any bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness of Acquireco having the right to vote
(or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which shareholders of Acquireco must vote. Except as
set forth above and except as set forth in Section (c) of the Acquireco
Disclosure Statement, as of the date of this agreement, there are not any
options to which Acquireco or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which
any of them is bound relating to the issued  ##### 

 

 

G-2  

       |    |   | or unissued capital stock of Acquireco or any of
its Subsidiaries, or obligating Acquireco or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, transfer, grant, sell or pay for or repurchase any shares of capital
stock or other equity interests in, or securities convertible or exchangeable
for any capital stock or other equity interests in, Acquireco or any of its
Subsidiaries or obligating Acquireco or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
grant, extend or enter into any such options. All shares of Acquirecos
capital stock that are subject to issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the
terms and conditions specified in the instrument pursuant to which they
are issuable, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable. The issuance and sale of all of the shares of capital stock
described in this Section (c) of Schedule G have been in compliance with all
Laws. Acquireco has previously provided Target with a schedule setting forth
the number of Acquireco stock options (including the number of shares
issuable upon exercise of Acquireco stock options and the exercise price and
vesting schedule with respect thereto) held by all holders of Acquireco stock
options. Section (c) of the Acquireco Disclosure Statement sets forth the
average exercise price for outstanding Acquireco stock options. Except as set
forth in Section (c) of the Acquireco Disclosure Statement, Acquireco has not
agreed to register any securities under any securities Laws or granted
registration rights to any person or entity; copies of all such
agreements have previously been made available to Target. As of the date of
this agreement, there are not any outstanding contractual obligations or
other requirements of Acquireco or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase,
redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of Acquireco or any
of its Subsidiaries, or provide funds to or make any investment (in the form
of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in, any Subsidiary of Acquireco
or any other person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
except as set forth in Section (c) of the Acquireco Disclosure Statement,
there are no phantom equity or similar rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments based upon the book value, income or any other attribute of
Acquireco or any of its Subsidiaries.

agreement. The board of directors of each of Acquireco and Canco has
unanimously approved this agreement and the Transactions. The execution and
delivery of this agreement by each of Acquireco and Canco and the
consummation by Acquireco and Canco, as applicable, of the Transactions have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of
Acquireco and Canco, as applicable. No approval of the shareholders or other
securityholders of Acquireco or Canco or other corporate proceedings on the
part of Acquireco or any of its Subsidiaries are necessary to authorize this
agreement, the performance by Acquireco and Canco of their obligations under
this agreement and the Transactions. This agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by each of Acquireco and Canco and  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

G-3  

       |   |   | constitutes a valid and binding obligation of each
of Acquireco and Canco, enforceable by Target against each of Acquireco and
Canco in accordance with its terms, subject to the availability of equitable
remedies and the enforcement of creditors rights generally. Except as set
forth in Section (d) of the Acquireco Disclosure Statement, the execution
and delivery of this agreement does not, and the consummation of
the Transactions and compliance with the provisions of this agreement will
not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default (with or
without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
consent, termination, purchase, cancellation or acceleration of any
obligation or to loss of any property, rights or benefits under, or result in
the imposition of any additional obligation under, or result in the creation
of any Lien upon any of the properties or assets of Acquireco or any of its
Subsidiaries under, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of

delivery of this agreement by Acquireco or the consummation by Acquireco of
the Transactions, except for (i) any approvals required by the Interim Order
or the Final Order, and (ii) the approvals listed on Schedule H.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | Each of Acquireco and its Subsidiaries possesses all
Permits necessary to conduct its business as such business is currently
conducted or is expected to be conducted following completion of the
Transaction, except where the failure to possess such Permits would not be

Permits are validly held by Acquireco or its Subsidiaries, and Acquireco and
its Subsidiaries have complied in all respects with all terms and conditions
thereof, (ii) none of such Permits will be subject to suspension,
modification, revocation or non-renewal as a result of the execution and
delivery of this agreement or the consummation of the Transactions, and (iii)
since July 1, 2009, neither Acquireco nor any of its Subsidiaries has

any of its Subsidiaries requires any Permit required for its business as such
business is currently conducted, that is not currently held by it.  
   

  

       | (e)  |   | Publicly Filed Documents; Undisclosed
Liabilities. Except as set forth in Section (e) of the Acquireco Disclosure
Statement, Acquireco has filed all required reports, schedules, forms,
statements and other documents (including  
---|---|---|--- ##### 

 

 

G-4  

       |   |   | documents incorporated by reference) with the
applicable security regulatory Agencies since July 1, 2006 (the "Acquireco
Public Disclosure Documents"). Except as set forth in Section (e) of the
Acquireco Disclosure Statement, as of its date, each Acquireco Public
Disclosure Document complied in all material respects with the requirements
of the _Securities Act_ or the _Securities Exchange Act_ , as applicable, and
the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such Acquireco
Public Disclosure Document. None of the Acquireco Public Disclosure
Documents, as of their respective dates, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent that such statements have been modified or superseded by a later-filed
Acquireco Public Disclosure Document. The consolidated financial statements
of Acquireco included in the Acquireco Public Disclosure Documents comply as

the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis during
the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)

normal year-end audit adjustments). Except as and to the extent disclosed,
reflected or reserved against on the balance sheet or the notes thereto of
Acquireco as of June 30, 2009 included in the Filed Acquireco Public
Disclosure Documents, as incurred after the date thereof in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and prohibited by this

nature, whether known or unknown, absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether due or to become due, that, individually or in the
aggregate, have had or would reasonably be expected to have a Materially
Adverse effect on Acquireco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

       | (f)  |   | Information Supplied. None of the information
supplied or to be supplied by Acquireco or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or

in order to make the statements therein, in light of circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading.

course, and:  
   

  

       | (i)  |   | there has not been any event, change, effect or

respect of which senior management believes that confirmation of the board of

       | (iv)  |   | there has not been any change in accounting

Materially Adverse to Acquireco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; and  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (iii)  |   | the data or information made available to
Target in respect of Acquireco and its Subsidiaries, was complete and correct
in all material respects and, did not, at the time it was made available and

timely filed, or caused to be timely filed with the appropriate Agency, all
Tax Returns required to be filed by them, and have timely paid, or caused to
be timely paid, all material amounts of Taxes due and payable by them,
including all instalments on account of any Taxes, except for any such
failure to file or failure to pay which would not individually or in the
aggregate, have a Materially Adverse effect on Acquireco. All such Tax
Returns are true, correct and complete in all material respects and have been
completed in accordance with applicable Laws. To the best of Acquirecos
knowledge, no such Tax Return contains any misstatement or omits any
statement that should have been included therein.

(and political subdivisions thereof) or received written notification from
any Agency that it may be required to file on such basis.  
      
    | (ix)  |   | There are no Tax liens on any assets of Acquireco or

the date of this agreement, Acquireco together with its affiliates (as
defined in the _Competition Act_  (Canada)) do not have: (a) total assets in

acting in good faith and in its sole discretion, economic equivalence for the
purposes of any event referred to in Section 2.7(a) or Section 2.7(b) and
each such determination shall be conclusive and binding on RG. In making each
such determination, the following factors shall, without excluding other
factors determined by the Board of Directors of Canco to be relevant, be
considered by the Board of Directors of Canco:

option or warrant and the Current Market Price of a RG Share;  
      
    | (iii)  |   | in the case of the issuance or distribution of any
other form of property (including any shares or securities of RG of any class
other than RG Shares, any rights, options or warrants other than those
referred to in Section 2.7(d)(ii), any evidences of indebtedness of RG or any
assets of RG), the relationship between the fair market value (as determined
by the Board of Directors of Canco in the manner above contemplated) of such
property to be issued or distributed with respect to each outstanding RG
Share and the Current Market Price of a RG Share;  
      
    | (iv)  |   | in the case of any subdivision, redivision or change
of the then outstanding RG Shares into a greater number of RG Shares or the
reduction, combination, consolidation or change of the then outstanding RG
Shares into a lesser number of RG Shares or any amalgamation, merger,
arrangement, reorganization or other transaction affecting RG Shares, the
effect thereof upon the then outstanding RG Shares; and  
      
    | (v)  |   | in all such cases, the general taxation consequences of
the relevant event to holders of Exchangeable Shares to the extent that
such consequences may differ from the taxation consequences to holders of RG
Shares as a result of differences between taxation laws of Canada and the
United States (except for any differing consequences arising as a result of
differing withholding taxes and marginal taxation rates and without regard to
the individual circumstances of holders of Exchangeable Shares).  
   

  

       | (e)  |   | Canco agrees that, to the extent required, upon
due notice from RG, Canco shall use its best efforts to take or cause to be
taken such steps as may be necessary for the purposes of ensuring that

subdivisions, redivisions or changes are made to the Exchangeable Shares, in
order to implement the required economic equivalence with

2.8 Tender Offers 

   

 In the event that a tender offer, share exchange offer, issuer bid, take-over bid or similar transaction with respect to RG Shares (an "Offer") is proposed by RG or is proposed to RG or its shareholders and is recommended by the Board of Directors of RG, or is otherwise effected or to be effected with the consent or approval of the Board of Directors of RG, and the Exchangeable Shares are not redeemed by Canco or purchased by Callco pursuant to the Redemption Call Right, RG shall expeditiously and in good faith take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable to enable and permit holders of Exchangeable Shares (other than RG and its affiliates) to participate in such Offer to the same extent and on an economically equivalent basis as the holders of RG Shares, without discrimination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, RG shall expeditiously and in good faith take all such actions and do all such things as are necessary or desirable to ensure that holders of Exchangeable Shares may participate in each such Offer without being required to retract Exchangeable Shares as against Canco (or, if so required, to ensure that any such retraction, shall be effective only upon, and shall be conditional upon, the closing of such Offer and only to the extent necessary to tender or deposit to the Offer).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, but subject to Article 3, RG shall not be in violation of this Section 2.9 if any person or group of persons acting jointly or in concert acquire all or substantially all of the assets of RG or the RG Shares pursuant to any merger of RG pursuant to which RG was not the surviving corporation. 

  

2.10 RG and Affiliates Not to Vote Exchangeable Shares 

   

 RG covenants and agrees that it shall appoint and cause to be appointed proxyholders with respect to all Exchangeable Shares held by it and its affiliates for the sole purpose of attending each meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares in order to be counted as part of the quorum for each such meeting. RG further covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its affiliates not to, exercise any voting rights which may be exercisable by holders of Exchangeable Shares from time to time pursuant to the Share Provisions or pursuant to the provisions of the CBCA (or any successor or other corporate statute by which Canco may in the future be governed) with respect to any Exchangeable Shares held by it or by its affiliates in respect of any matter considered at any meeting of holders of Exchangeable Shares.  #####

2.12 Stock Exchange Listing 

   

 RG covenants and agrees in favour of Canco that, as long as any outstanding Exchangeable Shares are owned by any person other than RG or any of its affiliates, RG shall use reasonable efforts to maintain a listing for such Exchangeable Shares on The Toronto Stock Exchange.

necessary or advisable to evidence the assumption by the RG Successor of
liability for all moneys payable and property deliverable hereunder and the

obligations of RG under this agreement; and

 Whenever the conditions of Section 3.1 have been duly observed and performed, the parties, if required by Section 3.1, shall execute and deliver the supplemental agreement provided for in Section 3.1(a) and thereupon the RG Successor and such other person that may then be the issuer of the RG Shares shall possess and from time to time may exercise each and every right and power of RG under this agreement in the name of RG or otherwise and any act or proceeding by any provision of this agreement required to be done or performed by the Board of  #####

which all or substantially all of the then outstanding RG Shares are acquired

Act (otherwise than by virtue of a right referred to in paragraph 251(5)(b)
thereof);

receive such shares (the "Other Shares") or another corporation (the "Other
Corporation") that, immediately after such RG Control Transaction, owns or
controls, directly or indirectly, RG;  
   

 

then all references herein to "RG" shall thereafter be and be deemed to be
references to "Other Corporation" and all references herein to "RG Shares"
shall thereafter be and be deemed to be references to "Other Shares" (with
appropriate adjustments if any, as are required to result in a holder of
Exchangeable Shares on the exchange, redemption or retraction of such shares
pursuant to the Exchangeable Share Provisions or Article 5 of the Plan of
Arrangement or exchange of such shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange
Trust Agreement immediately subsequent to the RG Control Transaction being
entitled to receive that number of Other Shares equal to the number of

exchange, redemption or retraction of such shares pursuant to the
Exchangeable Share Provisions or Article 5 of the Plan of Arrangement, or
exchange of such shares pursuant to the Voting and Exchange Trust Agreement
had occurred immediately prior to the RG Control Transaction and the RG
Control Transaction was completed) without any need to amend the terms and
conditions of the Exchangeable Shares and without any further action
required.  #####

 All of the rights of a Beneficiary with respect to the Beneficiary Votes exercisable in respect of the Exchangeable Shares held by such Beneficiary, including the right to instruct the Trustee as to the voting of or to vote personally such Beneficiary Votes, shall be deemed to be surrendered by the Beneficiary to RG, as the case may be, and such Beneficiary Votes and the Voting Rights represented thereby shall cease immediately upon (i) the delivery by such holder to the Trustee of the certificates representing such Exchangeable Shares in connection with the occurrence of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for RG Shares, as specified in Article 5 (unless RG shall not have delivered the requisite RG Shares issuable in exchange therefor to the Trustee pending delivery to the Beneficiaries), or (ii) the retraction or redemption of Exchangeable Shares pursuant to Section 6 or 7 of the Share Provisions, or (iii) the effective date of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of Canco pursuant to Section 5 of the Share Provisions, or (iv) the purchase of Exchangeable Shares from the holder thereof by Callco pursuant to the exercise by Callco of the Retraction Call Right, the Redemption Call Right or the Liquidation Call Right, or upon the purchase of Exchangeable Shares form the holders thereof by RG or Callco pursuant to the exercise by RG or Callco of the Change of Law Call Right (as defined in the Plan of Arrangement).

to time, or as would be required under the articles of RG or any laws or
regulations, or pursuant to the rules or regulations of any Agency, if the

 The Exchange Right shall be and remain vested in and exercisable by Trustee. Subject to Section 6.15, the Trustee shall exercise the Exchange Right only on the basis of instructions received pursuant to this Article 5 from Beneficiaries entitled to instruct the Trustee as to the exercise thereof. To the extent that no instructions are received from a Beneficiary with respect to the Exchange Right, the Trustee shall not exercise or permit the exercise of the Exchange Right. 

  

5.4 Purchase Price 

   

 The purchase price payable by RG for each Exchangeable Share to be purchased by RG under the Exchange Right shall be an amount per share equal to (i) the Current Market Price of an RG Share on the day before the exchange, which shall be satisfied in full by RG issuing to the Beneficiary one RG Share, plus (ii) an additional amount equal to the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the date of the exchange. In connection with each exercise of the Exchange Right, RG shall provide to the Trustee an Officers Certificate setting forth the calculation of the purchase price for each Exchangeable Share. 

  

5.5 Exercise Instructions 

   

 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, a Beneficiary shall be entitled upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Insolvency Event, to instruct the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right with respect to all or any part of the Exchangeable Shares registered in the name of such Beneficiary on the books of Canco. To cause the exercise of the Exchange Right by the Trustee, the Beneficiary shall deliver to the Trustee, in person or by certified or registered mail, at its principal office in  or at such other place as the Trustee may from time to designate by written notice to the Beneficiaries, the certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which such Beneficiary desires RG to purchase, duly endorsed in blank for transfer, and accompanied by such other documents and instruments as the Trustee, RG and Canco may reasonably require together with (a) a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right, contained on the reverse of or attached to the Exchangeable Share certificates, stating (i) that the Beneficiary thereby instructs the Trustee to exercise the Exchange Right so as to require RG to purchase from the Beneficiary the number of Exchangeable Shares specified therein, (ii) that such Beneficiary has good title to and owns all such Exchangeable Shares to be acquired by RG free and clear of all liens, claims, security interests and encumbrances, (iii) the names in which the certificates representing RG Shares issuable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange Right are to be issued, and (iv) the names and addresses of the persons to whom such new certificates should be delivered, and (b) payment (or evidence satisfactory to the Trustee, RG and Canco of payment) of the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.7 of this agreement. If only a part of the Exchangeable Shares represented by any certificate or  ##### 

 

 

J-12   

certificates delivered to the Trustee are to be purchased by RG under the
Exchange Right, a new certificate for the balance of such Exchangeable Shares
shall be issued to the holder at the expense of Canco. 

  

5.6 Delivery of RG Shares; Effect of Exercise 

   

 Promptly after the receipt by the Trustee of the certificates representing the Exchangeable Shares which the Beneficiary desires RG to purchase under the Exchange Right, together with such documents and instruments of transfer and a duly completed form of notice of exercise of the Exchange Right (and payment of taxes, if any payable as contemplated by Section 5.7 or evidence thereof), duly endorsed for transfer to RG, the Trustee shall notify RG and Canco of its receipt of the same, which notice to RG and Canco shall constitute exercise of the Exchange Right by the Trustee on behalf of the Beneficiary in respect of such Exchangeable Shares, and RG shall promptly thereafter deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, for delivery to the Beneficiary in respect of such Exchangeable Shares (or to such other persons, if any, properly designated by such Beneficiary) the Exchangeable Share Consideration deliverable in connection with the exercise of the Exchange Right; provided, however, that no such delivery shall be made unless and until the Beneficiary requesting the same shall have paid (or provided evidence satisfactory to the Trustee, Canco and RG of the payment of) the taxes (if any) payable as contemplated by Section 5.7 of this agreement. Immediately upon the giving of notice by the Trustee to RG and Canco of the exercise of the Exchange Right, as provided in this Section 5.6, the closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the Exchange Right shall be deemed to have occurred, and the Beneficiary of such Exchangeable Shares shall be deemed to have transferred to RG all of such Beneficiarys right, title and interest in and to such Exchangeable Shares and in the related interest in the Trust Estate and shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and shall not be entitled to exercise any of the rights of a holder in respect thereof, other than the right to receive his proportionate part of the total Exchangeable Share Consideration therefor, unless such Exchangeable Share Consideration is not delivered by RG to the Trustee for delivery to such Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any, properly designated by such Beneficiary) within three business days of the date of the giving of such notice by the Trustee, in which case the rights of the Beneficiary shall remain unaffected until such Exchangeable Share Consideration is delivered by RG and any cheque included therein is paid. Upon delivery of such Exchangeable Share Consideration to the Trustee, the Trustee shall promptly deliver such Exchangeable Share Consideration to such Beneficiary (or to such other person, if any, properly designated by such Beneficiary). Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall be considered and deemed for all purposes to be the holder of the RG Shares delivered to it pursuant to the Exchange Right. 

  

5.7 Stamp or Other Transfer Taxes 

   

 Upon any sale of Exchangeable Shares to RG pursuant to the Exchange Right or the Automatic Exchange Right, the share certificate or certificates representing RG Shares to be delivered in connection with the payment of the purchase price therefor shall be issued in the name of the Beneficiary in respect of the Exchangeable Shares so sold or in such names as such Beneficiary may otherwise direct in writing without charge to the holder of the Exchangeable Shares so sold; provided, however, that such Beneficiary (a) shall pay (and none of RG, Canco or the Trustee shall be required to pay) any documentary, stamp, transfer of other taxes that may  ##### 

 

 

J-13   

be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of
such shares to a person other than such Beneficiary or (b) shall have
evidenced to the satisfaction of RG that such taxes, if any, have been
paid. 

  

5.8 Notice of Insolvency Event 

   

 As soon as practicable following the occurrence of an Insolvency Event or any event that with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would be an Insolvency Event, Canco and RG shall give written notice thereof to the Trustee. As soon as practicable following the receipt of notice from Canco and RG of the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, or upon the Trustee becoming aware of an Insolvency Event, the Trustee shall mail to each Beneficiary, at the expense of RG (such funds to be received in advance), a notice of such Insolvency Event in the form provided by RG, which notice shall contain a brief statement of the rights of the Beneficiaries with respect to the Exchange Right. 

  

5.9 Failure to Retract 

   

 Upon the occurrence of an event referred to in paragraph (iv) of the definition of Insolvency Event, Canco hereby agrees with the Trustee and in favour of the Beneficiary promptly to forward or cause to be forwarded to the Trustee all relevant materials delivered by the Beneficiary to Canco or to the transfer agent of the Exchangeable Shares (including a copy of the retraction request delivered pursuant to Section 6(1) of the Share Provisions) in connection with such proposed redemption of the Retracted Shares. 

  

5.10 Listing of RG Shares 

   

 RG covenants that if any RG Shares to be issued and delivered pursuant to the Automatic Exchange Right or the Exchange Right require registration or qualification with or approval of or the filing of any document, including any prospectus or similar document, or the taking of any proceeding with or the obtaining of any order, ruling or consent from any Agency under any United States or Canadian federal, provincial or territorial law or regulation or pursuant to the rules and regulations of any Agency or the fulfillment of any other United States or Canadian legal requirement before such shares may be issued and delivered by RG to the initial holder thereof or in order that such shares may be freely traded (other than any restrictions of general application on transfer by reason of a holder being a "control person" or the equivalent of RG for purposes of Canadian securities Law or any United States equivalent), RG shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which, for greater certainty, shall not require RG to consent to a term or condition of an approval or consent which RG reasonably determines could have a materially adverse effect on RG or its subsidiaries) to cause such RG Shares (or such other shares or securities) to be and remain duly registered, qualified or approved. RG shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (which, for greater certainty, shall not require RG to consent to a term or condition of an approval or consent which RG reasonably determines could have a materially adverse effect on RG or its subsidiaries) to cause all RG Shares (or such other shares or securities) to be delivered pursuant to the Automatic Exchange Right or the Exchange Right to be listed, quoted or posted for trading on all stock exchanges and quotation systems on which outstanding RG Shares have been listed by RG and remain listed and are quoted or posted for trading at such time.  ##### 

 

 

J-14  

5.11 RG Shares 

   

 RG hereby represents, warrants and covenants that the RG Shares issuable as described herein will be duly authorized and validly issued as fully paid and shall be free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance. 

  

5.12 Automatic Exchange on Liquidation of RG 

   

 (1) RG shall give the Trustee written notice of each of the following events at the time set forth below: 

  

       | (a)  |   | in the event of any determination by the board of
directors of RG to institute voluntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up
proceedings with respect to RG or to effect any other distribution of assets
of RG among its shareholders for the purpose of winding up its affairs, at
least 60 days prior to the proposed effective date of such liquidation,
dissolution, winding-up or other distribution; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | as soon as practicable following the earlier of (A)
receipt by RG of notice of, and (B) RG otherwise becoming aware of any
instituted claim, suit, petition or other proceedings with respect to the
involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of RG or to effect any
other distribution of assets of RG among its shareholders for the purpose of
winding up its affairs, in each case where RG has failed to contest in
good faith any such proceeding commenced in respect of RG within 30 days of
becoming aware thereof.  
   

  

 (2) As soon as practicable following receipt by the Trustee from RG of notice of any event (a "Liquidation Event") contemplated by Section 5.12(1)(a) or Section 5.12(1)(b), the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the Beneficiaries. Such notice shall be provided to the Trustee by RG and shall include a brief description of the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for RG Shares provided for in Section 5.12(3). 

  

 (3) In order that the Beneficiaries will be able to participate on a pro rata basis with the holders of RG Shares in the distribution of assets of RG in connection with a Liquidation Event, immediately prior to the effective date (the "Liquidation Event Effective Date") of a Liquidation Event, all of the then outstanding Exchangeable Shares shall be automatically exchanged for RG Shares. To effect such automatic exchange, RG shall purchase each Exchangeable Share outstanding immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date and held by Beneficiaries, and each Beneficiary shall sell the Exchangeable Shares held by it at such time, free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance, for a purchase price per share equal to (i) the Current Market Price of an RG Share on the day prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, which shall be satisfied in full by RG issuing to the Beneficiary one RG Share, plus (ii) an additional amount equal to the full amount of all declared and unpaid dividends on each such Exchangeable Share held by such holder on any dividend record date which occurred prior to the date of the exchange. RG shall provide the Trustee with an Officers Certificate in connection with each automatic exchange setting forth the calculation of the purchase price for each Exchangeable Share. Upon payment by RG of such purchase price, the relevant Beneficiary shall cease to have any right to be paid by Canco any amount in respect of declared and unpaid dividends on each Exchangeable Share.  ##### 

 

 

J-15  

 (4) The closing of the transaction of purchase and sale contemplated by the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for RG Shares shall be deemed to have occurred immediately prior to the Liquidation Event Effective Date, and each Beneficiary shall be deemed to have transferred to RG all of the Beneficiarys right, title and interest in and to such Beneficiarys Exchangeable Shares free and clear of any lien, claim or encumbrance and the related interest in the Trust Estate and each such Beneficiary shall cease to be a holder of such Exchangeable Shares and RG shall issue to the Beneficiary the RG Shares issuable upon the automatic exchange of Exchangeable Shares for RG Shares and on the applicable payment date shall deliver to the Trustee for delivery to the Beneficiary a cheque for the balance, if any, of the purchase price for such Exchangeable Shares, without interest, in each case less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.13. Concurrently with such Beneficiary ceasing to be a holder of Exchangeable Shares, the Beneficiary shall become the holder of the RG Shares issued pursuant to the automatic exchange of such Beneficiarys Exchangeable Shares for RG Shares and the certificates held by the Beneficiary previously representing the Exchangeable Shares exchanged by the Beneficiary with RG pursuant to such automatic exchange shall thereafter be deemed to represent RG Shares issued to the Beneficiary by RG pursuant to such automatic exchange. Upon the request of a Beneficiary and the surrender by the Beneficiary of Exchangeable Share certificates deemed to represent RG Shares, duly endorsed in blank and accompanied by such instruments of transfer as RG may reasonably require, RG shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Beneficiary certificates representing the RG Shares of which the Beneficiary is the holder. 

  

5.13 Withholding Rights 

   

 RG, Canco and the Trustee shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any dividend, distribution, price or other consideration otherwise payable under this agreement to any holder of Exchangeable Shares or RG Shares such amounts as RG, Canco or the Trustee is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the _Income Tax Act_ (Canada) or United States tax Laws or any provision of provincial, state, local or foreign tax Law, in each case as amended or succeeded. The Trustee may act and rely on the advice of counsel with respect to such matters. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing Agency. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted or withheld from any payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the consideration otherwise payable to the holder, RG, Canco and the Trustee are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose of such portion of the consideration as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to RG, Canco or the Trustee, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and RG, Canco or the Trustee shall notify the holder thereof and remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.  #####

J-24  

 (2) In no case shall RG or Canco be liable under this indemnity for any claim against any of the Indemnified Parties unless RG and Canco shall be notified by the Trustee of the written assertion of a claim or of any action commenced against the Indemnified Parties, promptly after any of the Indemnified Parties shall have received any such written assertion of a claim or shall have been served with a summons or other first legal process giving information as to the nature and basis of the claim. Subject to (ii) below, RG and Canco shall be entitled to participate at their own expense in the defence and, if RG and Canco so elect at any time after receipt of such notice, either of them may assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce any such claim. The Trustee shall have the right to employ separate counsel in any such suit and participate in the defence thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Trustee unless: (i) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by RG or Canco; or (ii) the named parties to any such suit include both the Trustee and RG or Canco and the Trustee shall have been advised by counsel acceptable to RG or Canco that there may be one or more legal defences available to the Trustee that are different from or in addition to those available to RG or Canco and that, in the judgement of such counsel, would present a conflict of interest were a joint representation to be undertaken (in which case RG and Canco shall not have the right to assume the defence of such suit on behalf of the Trustee but shall be liable to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel for the Trustee). This indemnity shall survive the termination of the Trust and the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

depreciation of the value of any part of the Trust Estate or any loss
