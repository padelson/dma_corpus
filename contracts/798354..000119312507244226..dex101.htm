iv STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of November 1, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made and entered into by and among FISERV, INC., a
Wisconsin corporation (" _Seller_ "), FISERV HEALTH, INC., a Delaware
corporation (" _Target_ "), and UNITED HEALTHCARE SERVICES, INC., a Minnesota
corporation (" _Buyer_ ").

_WITNESSETH_ :

WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the outstanding capital stock of Target (the "
_Target Shares_ ");

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase, and Seller desires to sell, all of the
Target Shares upon the terms and subject to the conditions described in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
certain key employees of the Target Group set forth in Exhibit A (the "
_Target Group Executives_ ") have entered into employment agreements with an
Affiliate of Buyer, each to take effect as of the Closing;

WHEREAS, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Seller and Buyer have entered into a trademark license agreement in the form
of Exhibit B hereto (the " _Transitional Trademark License Agreement_ ") and a
transition services agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ " and, together with the Transitional
Trademark License Agreement, the " _Ancillary Agreements_ "), each to take
effect as of the Closing; and

WHEREAS, Buyer, Seller and Target desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the purchase and sale
of the Target Shares and also to prescribe various conditions to the
transaction.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants,
representations and warranties made herein and intending to be bound hereby,
the parties hereto agree as follows:

ARTICLE I.

SALE AND PURCHASE OF TARGET SHARES

_1.1. _Purchase and Sale of Shares_. _

_1.1.1. Purchase Price._

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the
Closing, Seller shall sell to Buyer the Target Shares, and Buyer
shall purchase from Seller the Target Shares, in each case free and clear of
all Liens, for an aggregate purchase price equal to $775,000,000, as adjusted
as set forth in Section 1.1.1(b) and in accordance with Section 1.4 (such
purchase price, as so adjusted, the " _Purchase Price_ "). (b) The purchase price specified in Section 1.1.1(a) shall be adjusted as
follows:

(i) if the Estimated Working Capital is greater than $0, such purchase price
shall be increased by the dollar amount by which the Estimated Working
Capital is greater than $0;

(ii) if the Estimated Working Capital is less than $0, such purchase
price shall be reduced by the dollar amount by which the Estimated Working
Capital is less than $0; and

(iii) in all cases, such purchase price shall be reduced by an amount equal
to the Target Group Debt.

_1.1.2. Preparation of Estimated Balance Sheet_. Not fewer than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer in writing (a) an estimated consolidated balance sheet for the Target
Group as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Estimated Balance Sheet_
"), (b) a good faith estimate of the Purchase Price payable at Closing after
giving effect to the adjustments described in Section 1.1.1(b) (the "
_Estimated Purchase Price_ "), and (c) a good faith calculation, as of
immediately prior to the Closing, of (i) Estimated Working Capital and (ii)
Target Group Debt. The Estimated Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance
with GAAP, except as set forth on Section 2.2.3(a)-2 of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule, and on a basis consistent with the accounting methods, practices and
procedures used to prepare the Annual Financial Statements for Targets fiscal
year ending December 31, 2006 and the Latest Financial Statements, insofar as
such methods, practices and procedures are consistent with GAAP (including
appropriate closing adjustments, as if the Closing were at a fiscal year end)
except as set forth on Section 2.2.3(a)-2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
For illustrative purposes only, Exhibit D sets forth an example of the
Estimated Balance Sheet, as of July 31, 2007, and an example calculation of
Working Capital derived therefrom. Working Capital shall be calculated by
applying the terms and conditions of this Agreement on a basis consistent
with the sample calculation and methodology set forth on Exhibit D.

_1.2.  _The Closing__. The closing of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Sullivan and
Cromwell LLP in New York, New York, commencing at 9:00 a.m. local time on the
second Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
the obligations of the parties to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby (other than conditions with respect to actions the respective parties
will take at the Closing itself) or such other time and place as Buyer and
Seller may mutually determine (the " _Closing Date_ "), and shall be effective
for financial accounting and tax purposes as of 11:59 p.m. on the Closing
Date.



 

2 _1.3. _Deliveries at the Closing__. At the Closing:

(a) Buyer will deliver to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to one or more accounts designated in writing by Seller
(such designation to be made at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date), an amount in cash equal to the Estimated Purchase Price;

(b) Seller will deliver to Buyer the certificates referred to in Sections
4.2.1(c) below and 4.2.2 below;

(c) Buyer will deliver to Seller the certificates referred to in Sections
4.3.1(c) below and 4.3.2 below;

(d) Seller will deliver to Buyer stock certificates representing the Target
Shares, endorsed in blank or accompanied by duly executed stock powers;

(e) Seller shall deliver to Buyer the minute books, stock ledgers and
transfer records and the corporate seal for each entity that is a member of
the Target Group (including, without limitation, to the extent certificated,
certificates representing all outstanding shares of capital stock or other
equity interests of each entity that is a member of the Target Group), except
to the extent Applicable Law requires that such instruments be maintained at
the offices of such member of the Target Group;

(f) Seller shall deliver to Buyer an executed resignation, in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, effective as of the Closing Date, from each of
the directors of each member of the Target Group, except for resignations of
any such directors in respect of whom Buyer notifies Seller, at least ten (10)
days prior to Closing, that no such resignation is required;

(g) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a copy of a Certificate of Good Standing
from the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, as of date within
three (3) Business Days of the Closing Date, evidencing the good standing of
Target in such state;

(h) Seller shall deliver to Buyer an update to Section 2.2.3(g) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, setting forth a list, as of a date within five (5)
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, which is correct and complete as of
such date, of all bank accounts and safe deposit boxes of the Target Group,
the number of each such account or box and such information as Seller can
reasonably locate regarding the Persons authorized to draw on such accounts or
to access such boxes; and

(i) Seller shall deliver to Buyer a duly executed certification, substantially
in the form of Exhibit E hereto, that Seller is not a foreign person within
the meaning set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv).



 

3 _1.4. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_. _

(a) _Calculation of Final Purchase Price_. As soon as reasonably practicable,
but in no event later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare and cause to be delivered to Seller (i) a consolidated balance
sheet for the Target Group as of immediately prior to Closing (the " _Final
Balance Sheet_ "), (ii) a good faith calculation of the Purchase Price
payable at Closing after giving effect to the adjustments described in Section
1.1.1(b) (the " _Final Purchase Price_ "), and (iii) a good faith calculation,
as of immediately prior to the Closing, of (A) Working Capital and (B) Target
Group Debt. The Final Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except as set forth on Section 2.2.3(a)-2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
and on a basis consistent with the accounting methods, practices and
procedures used to prepare the Annual Financial Statements for Targets fiscal
year ending December 31, 2006 and the Latest Financial Statements, insofar as
such methods, practices and procedures are consistent with GAAP (including
appropriate closing adjustments, as if the Closing were at a fiscal year end)
except as set forth on Section 2.2.3(a)-2 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Working Capital shall be calculated by applying the terms and conditions of
this Agreement on a basis consistent with the sample calculation and
methodology set forth in Exhibit D. Buyers Representatives shall be permitted
reasonable access at all reasonable times to the books and records of
Seller and the personnel of Seller and/or Sellers Representatives (in the
case of Representatives, to the extent permitted by such Representatives and,
in each case, subject to Buyers execution and delivery of customary
agreements with such Representatives) to the extent that they relate to the
Target Group and to such historical financial information relating to the
Target Group as Buyer may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the
Estimated Balance Sheet or preparing the Final Balance Sheet and the
calculation of the Final Purchase Price and preparing materials for any
presentation to the Accounting Expert.

(b) _Examination by Seller_. Upon receipt of the Final Balance Sheet and
calculation of the Final Purchase Price, Seller and Sellers Representatives
shall be permitted during the succeeding sixty (60) day period (the " _Review
Period_ ") reasonable access at all reasonable times to the books and records
of the Target Group and the personnel of Buyer, the members of the Target
Group and/or Buyers Representatives (in the case of Representatives, to the
extent permitted by such Representatives and, in each case, subject to
Sellers execution and delivery of customary agreements with such
Representatives) to the extent that they relate to the Target Group and to
such historical financial information relating to the Target Group as Seller
may reasonably request for the purpose of reviewing the Final Balance Sheet
and the calculation of the Final Purchase Price and preparing materials for
any presentation to the Accounting Expert. 

(c) _Objection by Seller_. On or prior to the last day of the Review Period,
Seller may object to the calculation of the Final Purchase Price by
delivering to Buyer a written statement setting forth Sellers objections to
the calculation of the Final Purchase Price and a reasonable basis for such
objections, including, in reasonable detail, the specific items of
the calculation of the Final Purchase Price to which such objections relate
(the " _Statement of Objections_ "). If Seller fails to deliver the Statement
of Objections within the Review Period, Buyers calculation of the Final
Purchase Price shall be deemed to have been accepted by  



 

4  Seller and shall be final and binding and shall be used in computing the
Adjustment Amount. If Seller delivers the Statement of Objections within the
Review Period, subject to Section 1.4(d) below, Seller and Buyer shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve such objections, and, if the same are so
resolved, the calculation of the Final Purchase Price with such changes as may
have been previously agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer shall be final and
binding and shall be used in computing the Adjustment Amount. To the extent a
matter is not set forth in the Statement of Objections, such matter shall be
deemed to have been accepted and agreed to by Seller and all such matters and
any amounts related thereto shall be final and binding and shall be used in
computing the Adjustment Amount.

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_. If Seller and Buyer shall fail to reach an
agreement with respect to all of the matters set forth in the Statement of
Objections within thirty (30) days after the date of delivery of the
Statement of Objections (or such longer period as the parties hereto shall
agree in writing), then such unresolved matters shall, not later than ten (10)
days after the expiration of such thirty day period (or such longer period as
the parties hereto shall agree in writing), be jointly submitted by the
parties hereto for resolution to the Chicago, Illinois office of Ernst and Young
LLP or, if Ernst and Young LLP is not independent of Seller and Buyer at
such time, such other nationally recognized accounting firm to be mutually
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer (the " _Accounting Expert_ ") who shall,
acting as experts and not as arbitrators, resolve such matters and make any
resulting adjustments to the calculation of the Final Purchase Price. The
Accounting Expert shall be bound by a mutually agreeable confidentiality
agreement.

(e) _Fees of the Accounting Expert_. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Expert shall be borne by Seller and Buyer in such proportion as is appropriate
to reflect the relative percentages of the aggregate dollar amount of all
matters submitted to the Accounting Expert that were resolved against Seller
or Buyer, respectively. For example, if Seller objects to the calculation of
the Final Purchase Price by an amount of $100,000, and the Accounting Expert
resolves such matters submitted to it in a manner that results in an upward
adjustment to the calculation of the Final Purchase Price of $40,000, Buyer
shall bear 40% of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Expert and Seller
shall bear the other 60% of such fees and expenses.

(f) _Access to Supporting Documentation_. Subject to, and to the extent
permitted by, any Applicable Laws, Seller and Buyer and their respective
Representatives (in the case of Representatives, to the extent permitted by
such Representatives and, in each case, subject to the execution and delivery
of customary agreements with such Representatives) shall each make reasonably
available to the Accounting Expert all relevant work papers and books and
records relating to the Target Group, and copies of all such materials and
information provided by a party to the Accounting Expert shall be
concurrently delivered to the other party to the proceeding. The Accounting
Experts determination shall be based solely on its review of such work papers
and books and records relating to the Target Group and the written
information and presentations provided by Buyer and Seller (or their
Representatives), which are in accordance with the terms and procedures set
forth in this Agreement, and not on the basis of an independent review.



 

5 (g) _Determination by Accounting Expert_. The parties shall jointly instruct
the Accounting Expert to make a determination as soon as practicable within
thirty (30) days (or such other time as the parties hereto shall agree in
writing) after its engagement only with respect to the disputed items
submitted to the Accounting Expert, whether and to what extent (if any) the
Final Purchase Price requires adjustment and a written explanation in
reasonable detail of each such required adjustment, including the basis
therefor. The procedures of this Section 1.4 are exclusive and
the determination of the Accounting Expert shall, absent manifest error, be
conclusive, final and binding upon the parties hereto and shall be used in
computing the Adjustment Amount.

(h) _Payment of Adjustment Amount_. Within two (2) Business Days of the later
of (i) acceptance of the calculation of the Final Purchase Price or (ii) the
resolution of Sellers objections in connection therewith in accordance with
this Section 1.4, the Purchase Price shall be recalculated by giving effect to
such final and binding amounts and, to the extent that the Final Purchase
Price is less than or more than the Estimated Purchase Price, (x) the Purchase
Price shall be adjusted downward (if the Final Purchase Price is less than the
Estimated Purchase Price) or upward (if the Final Purchase Price is greater
than the Estimated Purchase Price) respectively, on a dollar-for-dollar basis
by the amount of the difference between the Final Purchase Price and the
Estimated Purchase Price (such dollar amount, the " _Adjustment Amount_
"), and (y) Seller shall pay to Buyer, or Buyer shall pay to Seller, as the
case may be, the Adjustment Amount together with interest thereon accrued at a
rate per annum equal to the Prime Rate as published in the The Wall Street
Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect for the period from the Closing Date to
the date on which the Adjustment Amount is paid. Any such payment shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds as directed by Buyer or
Seller, as the case may be. 

ARTICLE II.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND TARGET

_2.1. _Disclosure Schedules__. On or prior to the date hereof, Seller has
delivered to Buyer (the " _Seller Disclosure Schedule_ "), and Buyer has
delivered to Seller (the " _Buyer Disclosure Schedule_ " and, together with
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, the " _Disclosure Schedules_ "), a schedule
each setting forth, among other things, items the disclosure of which is
necessary or appropriate either in response to an express disclosure
requirement contained in a provision hereof or as an exception to one or more
representations and warranties contained in Article II or to one or more of
the covenants contained in Article III; _provided_ , that the mere inclusion
of an item in the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule as
an exception to a representation, warranty or covenant shall not be deemed an
admission by a party that such item represents a material exception or fact,
event or circumstance or that such item has had or is reasonably likely to
result in a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the disclosing party.
Notwithstanding that the  



 

6  Disclosure Schedules are organized such that the responses or exceptions set
forth thereon are set forth under captions referencing the Sections
and subsections, if any, of this Agreement to which such responses or
exceptions apply, a disclosure in any section of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a disclosure for
all other sections of the Seller Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure
Schedule in respect of which it is reasonably apparent on its face that such
disclosure is applicable.

_2.2. _Representations and Warranties of Seller and Target__. Seller and
Target jointly and severally represent and warrant to Buyer, as of the date
hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows _:_

_2.2.1. Authorization; No Conflicts; Status of the Target Group, etc._

(a) _Due Organization, etc_. Section 2.2.1(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule sets forth a correct and complete list of Target and each of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Target Group_ "), their respective forms
and jurisdictions of incorporation or organization and each jurisdiction in
which a member of the Target Group is qualified to do business. Seller and
each member of the Target Group is a corporation, limited liability company
or limited liability limited partnership, as applicable, duly incorporated or
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its
respective jurisdiction of incorporation or organization, with the requisite
power and authority, as applicable, to carry on its business as now conducted
and presently proposed by Seller to be conducted and to own or lease and to
operate its properties as and in the places where such business is now
conducted and such properties are now owned, leased or operated. Each member
of the Target Group is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing
as a foreign corporation, limited liability company or limited liability
limited partnership, as applicable, in all jurisdictions in which the nature
of its business or its ownership of property requires it to be so qualified,
except for those failures to be so qualified that would not, individually or
in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
the Target Group.

taxable period through the Closing Date and the denominator of which shall be
the number of days in the taxable period. All Straddle Tax Returns shall be

extension or waiver of the limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or
assessment relating to the Target Group, or take any other similar action
relating to the filing of any Tax Return or the payment of any Tax, if such
election, adoption, change, amendment, agreement, settlement, surrender,
consent or other action would have the effect of increasing the Tax liability
of the Target Group for any period ending after the Closing Date or decreasing
any Tax attribute of the Target Group existing on the Closing Date. Seller
shall notify Buyer of any consent to any extension or waiver of the
limitation period applicable to any Tax claim or assessment relating to the
Target Group within fifteen (15) days of making such consent or waiver.

pharmacy benefit management and administration for group health plans,
including subrogation, bill review and claim repricing in connection therewith
or (z) disease management or care management programs for group health plans
(each, a " _Competing Business_ "); _provided, however_ , that the following
shall not be deemed a violation of this Section 3.1.8(a):

 

(i) ownership of stock of any corporation listed on a national securities
exchange or publicly traded on any nationally recognized over-the-counter
market so long as Seller and its Subsidiaries collectively do not own more
than an aggregate of five percent (5%) of the capital stock of such
corporation;

(ii) making or maintaining any investment (or engaging in any activity related
thereto) in a fiduciary or agency capacity of any type and carried out on
behalf of clients or other beneficiaries;

(iii) ownership of, an affiliation with, or the conduct of any other
prohibited activity with respect to, a Person that conducts, either directly
or indirectly, a Competing Business (any such Person, together with all of its
Affiliates, a " _Competing Person_ ") that is the direct or indirect result
of (A) the merger, consolidation, share exchange, sale or purchase of assets
or similar business combination involving Seller or any of its Affiliates and
any Competing Person or (B) the acquisition of any Competing Person by
Seller or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ if more than 15% of the total
revenue, assets or cash flows of the Competing Person in the calendar year
prior to such ownership or affiliation is attributable to any Competing
Business, Seller shall, prior to the first anniversary of the consummation of
such transaction, divest or discontinue the operations of the  



 

40  acquired business that constitute Competing Businesses; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that prior to any such divestiture, Seller shall provide
reasonable notice thereof to Buyer such that Buyer has a reasonable
opportunity to make an offer to purchase such business should it desire to do
so; or

(iv) ownership and operation of the Continued Retained Business.

(b) For purposes of clarity, the parties hereby acknowledge that, for all
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Competing Business" shall not include
the business of (i) workers compensation pharmacy benefits and
administration, (ii) consumer-directed health plan administration, or (iii)
health care banking and payments, except, in the case of payments, to the
extent acting as a third party administrator of healthcare benefits.

(c) Section 3.1.8 shall terminate immediately upon a Change in Control of
Seller; _provided, however_ , that for the balance of the Restricted Period
following any such Change in Control, Seller shall (i) cause any employees of
Seller or any Affiliate thereof who, at any time prior to Closing, had been
employed by any member of the Target Group or otherwise had been in receipt
of confidential information with respect to the Target Group, to continue to
abide by the provisions of this Section 3.1.8 including, without limitation,
by causing any such employees not to assist or participate in any Competing
Business engaged in by any other party who became an Affiliate of Seller in
connection with such Change in Control (a " _COC Party_ ") and (ii) keep
confidential, and not disclose to any COC Party, any confidential information
related to the Target Group (including, without limitation, customer or price
information).

(d) Seller hereby acknowledges that the geographic boundaries, scope of
prohibited activities and the time duration of the provisions of this Section
3.1.8 are reasonable and are no broader than are necessary to protect the
legitimate business interests of Buyer including, without limitation, the
ability of Buyer to realize the benefit of its bargain and enjoy the goodwill
of Target and the other members of the Target Group.

_3.1.9. Agreement Not to Hire._ During the Restricted Period, Seller shall
not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, hire, or directly or
indirectly attempt to hire away, any then-current employee of Buyer or any of
its Affiliates who is a Transferred Employee, or persuade any such employee
to leave employment with Buyer or any of its Affiliates; _provided_ , that a
general solicitation for employment through advertisements not specifically
directed at any Transferred Employees shall not be prohibited under this
Section 3.1.9 and the hiring of any Transferred Employees who are non-exempt
for purposes of the Fair Labor Standards Act and who are solicited through
such a general solicitation shall not be prohibited under this Section 3.1.9.



 

41 _3.1.10. Available Remedies._ Seller acknowledges that it would be difficult
to fully compensate Buyer or any of its Affiliates for damages resulting from
any breach by them of the provisions of Sections 3.1.8 or 3.1.9. Accordingly,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of
any actual or threatened breach of such provisions, Buyer and its Affiliates
shall (in addition to any other remedies which it may have) be entitled to
seek from any court of competent jurisdiction temporary and/or permanent
injunctive relief to enforce such provisions and recover attorneys fees and
costs for same, and such relief may be granted without the necessity of
proving actual damages or the inadequacy of money damages, or posting bond.
Seller further acknowledges that Sections 3.1.8 and 3.1.9 constitute
a material inducement to Buyer to complete the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and Buyer will be relying on the enforceability of Sections
3.1.8 and 3.1.9 in completing such transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

_3.1.11. Insurance Subsidiary Transactions._ Prior to Closing, Seller shall
(i) contribute $5,000,000 to the Insurance Subsidiary (so as to cause the
cash on hand thereof to be equal to at least such amount) and (ii) cause all
intercompany loans between the Insurance Subsidiary and Seller or any
Affiliate of Seller (other than members of the Target Group) to be cancelled,
without any cost or other liabilities to any member of the Target Group
resulting therefrom.

_3.2. _Covenants of Buyer_._

_3.2.1. Public Announcements._ From the date hereof to the Closing Date,
except as required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, make any public announcement in respect of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of
Seller, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Buyer will
cooperate with Seller and the Target Group to develop all public
communications and make appropriate members of management available at
presentations related to the transactions contemplated hereby as reasonably
requested by Seller.

_3.2.2. Further Actions._

(a)  _Generally_. From the date hereof to the Closing Date, Buyer will use
its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
cause the conditions set forth in Sections 4.1 and 4.3 to be satisfied as
promptly as practicable.

(b) _Filings, etc_. From the date hereof to the Closing Date, Buyer will (i)
as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than fifteen (15) days
following the date of this Agreement, file or supply, or cause to be filed or
supplied, all applications, notifications and information required to be filed
or supplied by or on behalf of Buyer or its Affiliates pursuant to Applicable
Law in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and (ii) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain from
any Governmental Authority or pursuant to Applicable Law any Consents required
to be obtained or made by Buyer  



 

42  or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby (collectively, the " _Buyer
Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ " and, together with the Seller Requisite
Regulatory Approvals, the " _Requisite Regulatory Approvals_ "), including but
not limited to (in the case of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii))
filings and Consents (i) pursuant to the HSR Act, (ii) under any applicable
state health or pharmacy third party benefits administration licensing laws or
regulations or (iii) with the Arizona Department of Insurance. Subject to the
rules, regulations and instructions of any relevant Governmental Authority,
Seller will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable
Buyer will consult with Seller, in each case subject to Applicable Laws
relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all material written
information submitted to any third party or any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable.

(c) _Other Actions_. Subject to Applicable Laws and the rules, regulations
and instructions of any relevant Governmental Authority, Buyer will, and will
cause its Affiliates to, coordinate and cooperate with Seller in exchanging
such information and supplying such reasonable assistance as may be reasonably
requested by Seller in connection with the filings and other actions
contemplated by Section 3.1.5(b).

(d) _Notice of Certain Events_. From the date hereof to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall promptly notify Seller of:

(i) any fact, condition, event or occurrence known to Buyer that will or
reasonably may be expected to result in the failure of any of the conditions
contained in Sections 4.1 and 4.3 to be satisfied;

(ii) any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the
consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

(iii) subject to Applicable Laws and the rules, regulations and instructions
of any relevant Governmental Authority, any notice or other communication
from any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

_3.2.3. Employee Benefit Matters._

(a) _Transferred Employee Benefits_. Buyer agrees: (i) to waive any
limitations regarding pre-existing conditions, waiting periods and actively
at work requirements under any new health benefit plan maintained by Buyer
(and/or any of its Affiliates) for the benefit of Transferred Employees to the
extent such condition, period or requirement was satisfied under any existing
health benefit plans in which Transferred Employees participate; and (ii) for
all purposes (other than benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan)
under all benefit plans and policies, to treat all service by Transferred
Employees with any member of the Target Group before the Closing Date as
service with Buyer and its Subsidiaries; and (iii) to recognize, for each
Transferred  



 

43  Employee, any unused vacation days set forth on Section 3.2.3(a)(iii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule that the Transferred Employee has accrued as
of the Closing Date for purposes of Buyers vacation plan or policies. Buyer
and Seller agree that (i) the Transferred Employees shall continue to
participate in Sellers medical and dental plans for the period beginning on
the Closing Date and ending on (x) December 31, 2007, if the Closing occurs
prior to January 1, 2008, and (y) the last day of the month in which the
Closing occurs, if the Closing occurs on or after January 1, 2008, and (ii)
Buyer shall reimburse Seller for the cost of providing the benefits described
in clause (i) of this sentence in the amount equal to the difference between
the COBRA rate for such benefits and the applicable employee premiums for such
benefits. Commencing on the later of January 1, 2008, and the first day of
the month following the month in which the Closing occurs, the Transferred
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the medical and dental plans of
Buyer on terms that are substantially comparable to the terms applicable to
similarly situated employees of Buyer. With respect to the Transferred
Employees, Seller agrees to amend its 401(k) plan to eliminate its last day of
employment requirement with respect to the Transferred Employees for purposes
of eligibility to receive any employer contributions from Seller under
Sellers 401(k) plan and Seller shall make post-Closing employer contributions
to its 401(k) plan for the benefit of the Transferred Employees on a pro rata
basis based on the Transferred Employees length of employment by Seller or
its Affiliates in 2007 and in accordance with its customary process. Buyer
agrees to accept rollovers from Sellers 401(k) plan for Target Employees.
Seller further agrees to 100% vest all Transferred Employees in its retirement
plans including its 401(k) plan. Other than the obligations specifically set
forth in this Section 3.2.3, Buyer shall have no liability with respect
to payment of benefits under any benefit plans of Seller in which any
Transferred Employee has or currently participates.

(b)  _Continuation of Employment_.

(i) Except as provided in this Section 3.2.3(b), immediately after the
Closing, Buyer shall continue the employment of all of the Target Group
Employees by transferring their employment to an Affiliate of Buyer, and any
Target Group Employee whose employment thus continues after the Closing Date
shall be a " _Transferred Employee_." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
Transferred Employee shall have any continuing rights to employment, and each
such employee shall be considered an "at will" employee, unless he/she has or
enters into a written employment agreement binding on Buyer or one of its
Affiliates. Buyer, in its sole discretion, and subject only to an obligation
to interview each person in good faith, may determine whether or not to
continue the employment of any Target Group Employee listed on Section
3.2.3(b)(i) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule. No later than fifteen (15) days
prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide Seller with a written list of
any Target Group Employee listed on Section 3.2.3(b)(i) of the Buyer
Disclosure Schedule whose employment will not continue after the Closing Date
(each a " _Non-Transferred Employee_ "). Seller will, or will cause each
member of the Target Group to, terminate the employment of, or transfer to
Seller or one of its Affiliates (other any member of the Target Group), any
Non-Transferred Employee, with such termination or transfer to take effect no
later than the Closing Date.



 

44 (ii) Seller shall be fully liable for all employment-related costs or
liabilities in respect of any Non-Transferred Employee, including but not
limited to any termination-related costs such as severance benefits, and
Seller shall fully indemnify Buyer and each member of the Target Group from
any such liability or cost.

 

(iii) The rest of this Section 3.2.3(b) notwithstanding, in the event that any
Target Group Employee is not actively at work on the Closing Date due to any
leave of absence, including but not limited to a short-term disability leave
(each an " _Inactive Employee_ "), such employee shall become a Non-
Transferred Employee and Seller shall assume the employment relationship for
that person and all costs and liabilities incurred as a result of that
employment relationship as described in Section 3.2.3(b)(ii). With respect to
any Inactive Employee who becomes a Non-Transferred Employee pursuant to
this Section 3.2.3(b)(iii), Buyers sole obligation shall be to pay, or cause
a member of the Target Group to pay, to Seller an amount for each such
Inactive Employee that is equal to the sum of (x) the short-term disability
payroll continuation payment made to such person, if any, (y) the Human
Resources and Payroll fees set forth on Exhibit 1 of the Transition Services
Agreement, and (z) the Health, Dental, Flexible Spending, HSA, HRA and COBRA
Plan Benefits fees set forth on Exhibit 1 of the Transition Services
Agreement; _provided, however,_ that for purposes of health insurance
reimbursement for each of the Inactive Employees, instead of the reimbursement
rate being the COBRA rate, such reimbursement rate shall equal $1,500 per
month for each such Inactive Employee; _provided, further_ , that with respect
to any Inactive Employee, Buyers payment obligation hereunder shall end on
the _earliest_ of: (A) the date on which the Inactive Employee becomes a
Transferred Employee pursuant to this Section 3.2.3(b)(iii), (B) the date on
which Seller terminates the Inactive Employee for any reason, or (C) the
sixth-month anniversary of the Closing Date. If any Inactive Employee is able
to return to work on or before the six-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
Buyer shall hire such person and such person shall become a Transferred
Employee as of the date that Buyer receives written notice from Seller that
the employee is able to return to work. For purposes of this Section
3.2.3(b)(iii) "able to return to work" means that Seller provides Buyer with
adequate documentation that the person is able to perform the essential
functions of his/her Target Group Employee position, with or without
reasonable accommodation.

(iv) The rest of this Section 3.2.3(b) notwithstanding, each Target Group
Employee listed on Section 3.2.3(b)(iv) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is
performing duties directed to performance by Harrington Benefit Services, Inc.
(which is a member of the Target Group) pursuant to a Services Agreement
dated October 25, 2007, between it and Kaiser Permanente Insurance Company
("Kaiser"). The parties acknowledge that the business transaction contemplated
by this Agreement will give Kaiser a contractual right to terminate the
afore-described Services Agreement. If Kaiser exercises its contractual
termination  



 

45  right prior to the Closing Date, then each such person will become a Non-
Transferred Employee for purposes of Sections 3.2.3(b)(i) and (ii). If
Kaiser exercises its contractual termination right after the Closing Date
then Seller shall be fully liable for and shall indemnify Buyer against any
and all liabilities arising out of Buyers decision to terminate the
employment of any person listed on Section 3.2.3(b)(iv) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule as a direct result of Kaiser exercising that contractual
right.

(v) Section 3.2.3(b)(v) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of
certain Target Group Employees who are performing duties directed to the
Retained Business (the "Retained Business Employees"). Accordingly,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2.3(b), (A) no
Retained Business Employee will become a Transferred Employee, (B) each
Retained Business Employee will become a Non-Transferred Employee and (C)
Seller shall transfer each such Retained Business Employee to a Retained
Business Transferee, with such transfer to take effect no later than the
Closing Date.

(c) _Severance._ Except as otherwise required by any Applicable Law, for a
12-month period beginning on the Closing Date, Buyer shall provide, or cause
each member of the Target Group to provide, to any Transferred Employee whose
employment is terminated other than for cause (within the meaning of the
severance payment schedule set forth on Section 3.2.3(c) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule), severance benefits that are no less favorable than as
would be determined in accordance with Targets existing severance payment
schedule (which is set forth on such severance payment schedule). To the
extent that any Transferred Employee who is a party to an agreement providing
for the payment of severance under certain circumstances, as set forth on
Section 2.2.8(a)(iii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, is terminated by
Buyer or any of its Affiliates or terminates or resigns his or her employment,
in each case within the first ninety (90) days immediately following the
Closing Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer for each such terminated Transferred
Employee the difference between the amount of severance paid to the Terminated
Employee under such employees severance agreement and the amount of
severance that such employee would have otherwise been eligible to receive
under the severance payment schedule set forth on Section 3.2.3(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule.

(d) _Vesting_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall take all actions
necessary to provide that all options to purchase the common stock of Seller,
restricted stock units of Seller or unvested shares of restricted stock of
Seller that are held by any Target Group Employee as of the Closing Date,
whether vested or unvested, shall be cancelled in exchange for the payment by
Seller to such Target Group Employee of the cash equivalent thereof;
_provided_ , that the foregoing shall not apply to restricted stock units
awarded to certain Target Group sales executives listed on Section 3.2.3(d) of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule, who were awarded such restricted stock units
pursuant to an incentive compensation plan or scheme, the unvested value of
which is set forth on Section 3.2.3(d) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.
Buyer will establish an incentive compensation arrangement to provide such
sales executives with an opportunity to earn such unvested value.



 

46 (e) _Deferred Compensation Plan_. On the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause a
member of the Target Group to continue to maintain sponsorship of the
Deferred Compensation Plan maintained by a member of the Target Group along
with any assets and liabilities associated therewith, including but not
limited to any assets or liabilities of the Rabbi Trust.

(f) _Incentive Compensation_.

(i) Seller shall, or shall cause each member of the Target Group to, fully
reflect or specifically reserve against in accordance with GAAP in the
Estimated Balance Sheet (and there shall be included in the Final Balance
Sheet), amounts adequate to pay all incentive compensation earned by any
Target Group Employee through the Closing Date. Buyer shall ensure that each
such employee is paid that amount no later than the customary payment date the
Target Group has used for such incentive compensation payments.

(ii) Set forth on Section 3.2.3(f)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule is a
listing of each Target Group Employee, including estimated incentive pay
and/or bonus accruals for each such employee for the remainder of calendar
year 2007. At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall deliver to Buyer an updated Section 3.2.3(f)(ii) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule that sets forth the estimated incentive pay and bonus
accruals for each Target Group Employee as of the Closing Date. Buyer shall
pay, or cause to be paid, to any Transferred Employee the amount of incentive
compensation such employee earns, pursuant to the terms of any incentive
compensation plan that is in effect as of the Closing Date, during the period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date and ending on December 31, 2007.
Any such earned compensation shall be paid no later than the customary payment
date the Target Group has used for such incentive compensation payments.

(iii) Seller agrees to pay or cause to be paid to selected Target Group
Employees incentive compensation described in Section 3.2.3(f)(iii) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule. Buyer agrees to pay or cause to be paid to select
Transferred Employees incentive compensation as described in Section
3.2.3(f)(iii) of the Buyer Disclosure Schedule.

_3.3. _Change of Name_._

(a) Except for the limited license expressly provided in the Transitional
Trademark License Agreement, all right, title and interest in and to (i) the
name "Fiserv" or any derivative thereof or any logo, trademark, service mark,
domain name, or trade name including such name, and (ii) any other trademark,
service mark, logo, domain name or other indicia or origin of the Seller and
its Affiliates (other than any member of the Target Group) ((i) and (ii)
collectively, the " _Seller Marks_ "), shall be retained by Seller or its
applicable Affiliates and none of Buyer or the Target Group shall have any
rights therein or thereto following the Closing.



 

47 (b) Except as expressly provided in the Transitional Trademark License
Agreement, immediately following Closing, Buyer will, and will cause each
member of the Target Group to, cease use of the Seller Marks and any other
designation of affiliation with Seller or its Affiliates (including the
removal of any Seller Marks from the name of any member of the Target Group
and the filing of all appropriate documentation with state authorities
relating thereto).

_3.4. _Cooperation__. 

(a) Seller and Buyer will, and Buyer will cause each member of the Target
Group to, provide the other party with such cooperation and information as
the other party may request in filing any Tax Return, in determining a
liability for any Tax or a right to a refund or credit of any Tax, in
defending an audit or in conducting any other proceeding in respect of any
Tax, in each case in connection with a Tax of a member of the Target Group
(including as a result of being included in a Seller Group) for a Tax period
that ends on or before the Closing Date or, in the case of a Tax period that
begins on or before the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, the
portion of the period through and including the Closing Date (such full or
partial period is a " _Pre-Closing Period_ "). Such cooperation shall include,
but not be limited to, providing access to the books and records of each
member of the Target Group, making employees of Buyer and of each member of
the Target Group available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
explanation of any documents or information provided hereunder or
as otherwise may be necessary or appropriate for any of the foregoing. Seller
and Buyer shall, and Buyer shall cause each member of the Target Group to,
retain all Tax Returns of a member of the Target Group, schedules and work
papers and all other material records or documents relating thereto or to a
member of the Target Groups inclusion in Seller Group Tax Returns for all
Pre-Closing Periods until 60 days after the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (including any extensions and waivers thereof), and at
the expiration of such period each party shall have the right to dispose of
any such Tax Returns or other documents or records after providing thirty (30)
days written notice to the other party, unless the other party requests that
such Tax Returns or other documents or records be delivered to it or be
retained.

(b) Buyer shall promptly notify Seller in writing within thirty (30) days
after receipt by Buyer, any of its Affiliates or any member of the Target
Group of notice of any pending or threatened federal, state, local or foreign
Tax audit, proposed adjustment or assessment which may affect the Tax
liability of any member of the Target Group for which Seller would be required
to indemnify Buyer pursuant to Section 6.10. Failure of Buyer to promptly
notify Seller shall be deemed a waiver of Buyers right to indemnification
under Section 6.10. Seller shall have the sole right to represent a member of
the Target Group in any Tax audit or administrative or court proceeding to the
extent it relates to (i) a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date,
or (ii) a Tax period that includes the Closing Date if the only items at issue
relate to the portion of the period prior to or including the Closing Date, to
 



 

48  control such audit or proceedings, and to employ counsel of its choice at
its expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall not be entitled to
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
claim for Taxes which would adversely affect Buyer or any member of the Target
Group for any period after the Closing Date without the prior written consent
of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed;
_provided_ , _however_ that such consent shall not be necessary to the extent
that Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer against the effects of any such
settlement. Seller shall be entitled to participate at its expense with
counsel of its choice in the defense of any claim for Taxes which may be the
subject of indemnification by Seller pursuant to Section 6.10 which is not
subject to Sellers control pursuant to this Section 3.4(b). Neither Buyer,
any member of the Target Group, nor any of their Affiliates may agree to
settle or pay any Tax claim which may be the subject of indemnification by
Seller under Section 6.10 without the prior written consent of Seller, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned.

_3.5. _Intercompany Relationships_._ 

(a) _Seller Guarantees_. Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause itself or one or more of its Affiliates to be substituted in all
respects for Seller or any of its Affiliates and for Seller and any of its
Affiliates to be otherwise removed or released, effective as of the Closing,
in respect of all obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates under
each guaranty, performance bond, letter of credit or similar instrument
obtained by Seller or any of its Affiliates to the extent that it is for the
benefit of any member of the Target Group (collectively, the " _Seller
Guarantees_ "), and for all obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates in
respect thereof to be terminated, with, in each case, such substitution,
removal, release and termination to be in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Seller. In the event that Buyer has been unable to effect any
such substitution, removal, release or termination with respect to any Seller
Guarantee effective as of the Closing, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such substitution, removal
and release and termination as soon as reasonably practicable, including,
without limitation, by providing substitute cash collateral. Buyer shall
promptly reimburse Seller for any payments made by Seller or any of
its Affiliates on or after the Closing in respect of any Seller Guarantee.

(b) _Target Guarantees_. Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to cause itself or one or more of its Affiliates (other than Target or any
other member of the Target Group) to be substituted in all respects for Target
or any other member of the Target Group and for Target and any member of
the Target Group to be otherwise removed or released, effective as of the
Closing, in respect of all obligations of Target and any member of the Target
Group under each guaranty, performance bond, letter of credit or similar
instrument obtained by Target or any other member of the Target Group for the
benefit of Seller or its Affiliates (other than Target or any other member of
the Target Group) (collectively, the " _Target Guarantees_ "), and for all
obligations of Target and any other member of the Target Group in respect
thereof to be terminated, with, in each case, such substitution, removal,
release and termination to be in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer. In the event that Seller has been unable to effect any  



 

49  such substitution, removal, release or termination with respect to any
Target Guarantee effective as of the Closing, from and after the Closing,
Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to effect such
substitution, removal and release and termination as soon as reasonably
practicable, including, without limitation, by providing substitute cash
collateral. Seller shall promptly reimburse Buyer for any payments made by
any member of the Target Group on or after the Closing in respect of any
Target Guarantee.

(c) _Termination of Contracts_. Except as set forth on Section 3.5(c) of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule, Seller shall terminate, or cause to be terminated,
all Target Contracts between Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than
Target or any other member of the Target Group) on the one hand, and any of
Target or any other member of the Target Group, on the other hand (other than,
for the avoidance of doubt, any of the Ancillary Agreements), effective as of
the Closing, in each case without any penalty or obligation for Target or any
other member of the Target Group.

(d) _Assignment of Contracts_. From and after the Closing, at Buyers
reasonable request, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, assign to
Buyer and its Affiliates any and all rights that Seller and its Affiliates may
have under any agreement, contract or commitment to the extent relating to
the protection of confidential information of Target or any other member of
the Target Group, other than any agreements entered into in connection with
the proposed sale or disposition of the Target Group, to the extent such
assignment is permissible under Applicable Law and the terms of the relevant
agreement, contract or commitment.

_3.6. _Title Insurance Policies.__ At Buyers request and Buyers sole cost
and expense, (i) Seller and Buyer shall each agree to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain prior to Closing, to the extent reasonably
practicable, a letter from Targets and/or the Target Groups current
provider of the Title Policy stating that the Title Policy will continue in
effect after the Closing and (ii) Seller shall cooperate with Buyer in seeking
a non-imputation endorsement to the Title Policy. 

_3.7. _Election under Section 338(h)(10)_._

(a) At the sole discretion of Buyer, Seller shall join with Buyer in making
joint elections under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any comparable
election under state or local Law) with respect to the purchase of the Target
Shares and the outstanding equity ownership interests of each other member of
the Target Group. The Target Group, Buyer and Seller shall cooperate fully
with each other in the making of such elections, including the filing of
all required IRS forms and comparable forms under state and local Law.
Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall provide to Buyer any information
reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with the filing of the Section
338(h)(10) elections. 

(b) Seller shall pay all Taxes attributable to the making of the Section
338(h)(10) elections, including any federal, state, or local Tax attributable
to an election under federal, state, or local law similar to the election
available under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code, and will indemnify the Buyer
against any claim arising out of any failure to pay any such Tax. 



 

50 (c) The Purchase Price shall be allocated among the assets of the Target Group
in accordance with their fair market value as reasonably determined by Buyer
and Seller in accordance with Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the
regulations thereunder (the " _Allocation_ "). Buyer shall initially determine
the Allocation and prepare a complete set of IRS Forms 8023 and 8883 (and any
comparable forms required to be filed under state or local tax Law) and any
additional data or materials required to be attached to Forms 8023 and 8883
pursuant to the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 338 of the
Code (" _Section 338 Forms_ "). Buyer will deliver the Section 338 Forms to
Seller for review no later than sixty (60) days prior to the date the Section
338 Forms are required to be filed. In the event Seller reasonably objects to
the manner in which the Section 338 Forms have been prepared, Seller will
notify Buyer within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the Section 338 Forms of
any such objection, and Buyer and Seller will endeavor in good faith to
resolve such dispute in the succeeding fifteen (15) days. If Buyer and Seller
are unable to resolve such dispute within such time period, Buyer and Seller
will submit such dispute to an independent accounting firm of recognized
national standing (the " _Allocation Arbiter_ ") mutually agreeable to Buyer
and Seller, which firm will not be the regular accounting firm of Buyer or
Seller. Promptly, but no later than fifteen (15) days after its acceptance of
appointment hereunder, the Allocation Arbiter will determine (based solely on
representations of Buyer and Seller and not by independent review) only those
matters in dispute that have been submitted to it and will render a
written report thereon, which will be conclusive and binding on Buyer and
Seller.

(d) Buyer and Seller shall (i) report the acquisition of the Target Shares by
Buyer in a manner consistent with the making of the Section 338(h)(10)
elections and (ii) not take a position in any Tax Return that is inconsistent
with the Section 338(h)(10) elections.

_3.8. _Retained Business__. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall cause the
Target Group to transfer the Contracts and other assets and liabilities set
forth on Section 3.8 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (collectively, the "
_Retained Business_ ") to one or more Persons that is not a member of the
Target Group (each, a " _Retained Business Transferee_ ").

by the eight-month anniversary of the date hereof;

(c) by Buyer by written notice delivered to Seller, if Seller shall have

representations and warranties made herein shall survive the Closing and
terminate as provided in this Section 6.1. Upon such termination, no party

shall have given appropriate notice to the party liable for indemnification
pursuant to this Article VI (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") before the
termination of the relevant representation or warranty as provided in this
section and, accordingly, any representation or warranty, and any liability
with respect thereto, that would otherwise terminate in accordance with this
Section 6.1 shall continue to survive if a notice of a claim shall have been
timely given under this Article VI on or prior to such termination, until such
claim has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as provided in this Article
VI, but only with respect to such claim. The representations and warranties
and the covenants and other obligations contained in this Agreement shall
survive the Closing for a period of twenty-four (24) months following the

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence (i) the representations and warranties

(ii) the representations and warranties in Sections 2.2.1(a), (b), clause (i)
of Section 2.2.1(c), and the second sentence of Section 2.2.1(d)

(Authorization; No Conflicts; Status of Buyer, etc.) (such representations
and warranties, the " _Buyer Fundamental Representations_ ") and the covenants
and other obligations in this Agreement shall survive the Closing
indefinitely.

_6.2.1. Seller Indemnity._

(a) Seller hereby agrees that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates and their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents and stockholders (the " _Buyer
Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of any damages, losses,
charges, liabilities, claims, demands, actions, suits, proceedings, payments,
judgments, settlements, assessments, costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees, and reasonable out-of-pocket disbursements) (collectively, "
_Losses_ ") imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted
against, any of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of third
party claims, claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise, directly or
indirectly relating to or to the extent arising or resulting from:

(i) subject to Section 6.2.1(b), any breach of any representation or warranty

equal to $10,000,000, in which case Seller shall be liable only for the amount
of Losses which exceed $7,500,000, and (ii) Seller shall not be liable to the
Buyer Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect to the matters
contained in Section 6.2.1(a)(i) that exceed an aggregate amount equal to 35%
of the Purchase Price.

_6.2.2. Buyer Indemnity._

 

(a) Buyer hereby agrees that from and after the Closing it shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates and their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents and stockholders (the "
_Seller Indemnified Parties_ ") from, against and in respect of any Losses
imposed on, sustained, incurred or suffered by, or asserted against, any of
the Seller Indemnified Parties, whether in respect of third party claims,
claims between the parties hereto, or otherwise, directly or indirectly
relating to, or to the extent arising out of or resulting from:

(i) subject to Section 6.2.2(b), any breach of any representation or warranty
made by Buyer contained in this Agreement, in all cases without giving effect
to any qualifications as to materiality, such as "in all material respects",
"material", "Material Adverse Effect" and similar qualifications contained in
such representations and warranties; and



 

56 (ii) any breach of a covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in this
Agreement. 

(b) Except with respect to fraud and claims with respect to breaches of any
Buyer Fundamental Representation, (i) Buyer shall not be liable to the Seller
Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect to the matters contained in
Section 6.2.2(a)(i) unless the Losses therefrom exceed an aggregate amount
equal to $10,000,000, in which case Buyer shall be liable only for the amount
of Losses which exceed $7,500,000, and (ii) Buyer shall not be liable to the
Seller Indemnified Parties for any Losses with respect to the matters
contained in Section 6.2.2(a)(i) that exceed an aggregate amount equal to 35%
of the Purchase Price.

_6.2.3. Exclusive Remedy_. Following Closing, except (i) with respect to a
claim to enforce this Article VI, (ii) with respect to fraud or (iii) as may
be contemplated by Section 1.4, the rights and remedies of Seller and Buyer
under this Article VI are exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights
and remedies which Seller and Buyer may have under, or with respect to, this
Agreement or otherwise against each other with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement for monetary relief with respect to any breach
of any representation or warranty or any failure to perform any covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement and Buyer and Seller each expressly
waives any and all other rights or causes of action it or its Affiliates may
have against the other party or its Affiliates for monetary relief now or in
the future under any Applicable Law with respect to the subject matter hereof.

_6.2.4. Further Limitations_. Except for actions required to be taken by
Buyer or any member of the Target Group pursuant to this Agreement or
otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, Seller shall not have any liability
under any provision of this Agreement for any Losses to the extent the

Price or the Adjustment Amount.

_6.3. _Third Party Claims; Direct Claims_._

(a) In the event that any claim or demand for which an Indemnifying Party may
have liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted against or
sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party (a " _Third
Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event (a)
more than thirty (30) days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of a
Third Party Claim, or (b), to the extent practicable, fewer than three (3)
days prior to any appearance in a litigated matter, notify the Indemnifying
Party in writing of such Third Party Claim, and the amount or the estimated
amount of damages or other relief sought thereunder to the extent then
ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount of
such Third Party Claim)  



 

57  and, to the extent practicable, any other material details pertaining
thereto (a " _Claim Notice_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
give a timely Claim Notice or otherwise comply with this Section 6.3(a) shall
not affect the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder unless, and then only
if and to the extent that, such failure has a prejudicial effect on
the defenses or other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect
to such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days
(or such lesser number of days set forth in the Claim Notice as may be
required by court proceeding in the event of a litigated matter) after
receipt of the Claim Notice (the " _Notice Period_ ") to notify the
Indemnified Party that it desires to defend the Indemnified Party against such
Third Party Claim.

(b) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
within the Notice Period that it desires to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend the Indemnified Party by appropriate proceedings and shall
have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel of its
choosing, at its expense, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall actively and
diligently defend such Third Party Claim by appropriate proceedings and (iii)
the Indemnified Party, prior to the period in which the Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of such matter, may take such reasonable actions to
preserve any and all rights with respect to such matter, without such actions
being construed as a waiver of the Indemnified Partys rights to defense and
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, but with such actions not being
determinative of the amount of any Losses. Once the Indemnifying Party has
duly assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense
and to employ separate counsel of its choosing. The Indemnified Party shall
participate in any such defense at its expense; _provided, however_ , that
such Indemnified Party shall be entitled to participate in any such defense
with separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party if,
(A) so requested by the Indemnifying Party to participate or (B) in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Party, a conflict or
potential conflict exists between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party that would make such separate representation advisable; and _provided,
further_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not be required to pay for more
than one such counsel for all Indemnified Parties in connection with any
Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any Third Party Claim.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Third Party Claim (i) would result in the
imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would materially
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party or any of
its Affiliates, (ii) would result in a finding or admission of a violation of
Applicable Law by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates, (iii) would
result in any monetary liability of the Indemnified Party that will not be
fully and promptly paid or reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party or (iv) is
reasonably likely to adversely impact any ongoing business of the Indemnified
Party or any of its Affiliates, then, in each such case, the Indemnified Party
alone shall be entitled to contest, defend, compromise and settle (subject,
with respect to any such settlement, to obtaining the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
such Third Party Claim in the first instance and, if the Indemnified Party
does not contest, defend, compromise or settle such Third Party Claim, the
Indemnifying Party shall then have the right to contest, defend, compromise
and settle (subject, with respect to any such settlement, to obtaining the
consent of the Indemnified Party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed) such Third Party Claim.



 

58 (c) If the Indemnifying Party (i) does not elect to defend the Indemnified
Party against a Third Party Claim, whether by not giving the Indemnified
Party timely notice of its desire to so defend or otherwise or (ii) after
assuming the defense of a Third Party Claim, fails to take commercially
reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within
thirty (30) days after receiving written notice from the Indemnified Party to
the effect that the Indemnifying Party has so failed, the Indemnified Party
shall have the right but not the obligation, to assume such defense and shall
have the sole power to direct and control such defense, with counsel of its
choosing; _it being understood that_ the Indemnified Partys right to
indemnification for a Third Party Claim shall not be adversely affected
by assuming the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnified Party
shall not settle a Third Party Claim without the consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

(d) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in the
conduct of the defense of a Third Party Claim, including by
providing reasonable access to each others relevant business records and
other documents, and employees.

(e) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent
with Applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel
and others representing any party to a Third Party Claim to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges.

(f) In the event any Indemnified Party has a claim against any Indemnifying
Party that does not involve a Third Party Claim, within thirty (30) days after
becoming aware of facts and circumstances sufficient to allow the Indemnified
Party to conclude that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 6.2 in respect of such claim, the Indemnified Party shall
notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such claim and the amount or the
estimated amount of damages or other relief sought thereunder to the extent
then ascertainable (which estimate shall not be conclusive of the final amount
of such claim) and, to the extent practicable, any other material details
pertaining thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to give a
timely notice or otherwise comply with this Section 6.3(f) shall not affect
the rights of an Indemnified Party hereunder unless, and then only if and to
the extent that, such failure has a prejudicial effect on the defenses or
other rights available to the Indemnifying Party with respect to such claim.

_6.4. _Trewit Litigation_._

(a) Following the Closing, Seller shall, at its own expense, (i) actively and
diligently defend the Buyer Indemnified Parties (including,
without limitation, the members of the Target Group) with respect to the
Trewit Litigation by appropriate  



 

59  proceedings and (ii) have the sole power to direct and control such defense,
with counsel of its choosing. The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have
the right, but not the obligation, to participate in such defense and to
employ separate counsel of their own choosing and may participate in such
defense at their own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if counsel for
the Buyer Indemnified Parties reasonably determines that there is a conflict
between the positions of Seller and the Buyer Indemnified Parties in
conducting the defense of such action or that there are legal defenses
available to the Buyer Indemnified Parties different from or in addition to
those available to Seller, then counsel for the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled, if the Buyer Indemnified Parties so elect, to conduct the
defense to the extent reasonably determined by such counsel to protect
the interests of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, at their own expense. Seller
shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise the Trewit Litigation in any manner that is reasonably likely to
have an ongoing material and adverse impact on the business and operations of
the Target Group. Subject to the preceding sentence, Seller shall be permitted
to settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise the Trewit Litigation
without the prior written consent of Buyer provided that such settlement
contains an unqualified release of the Target Group.

(b) The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the conduct of the
defense of the Trewit Litigation, including by providing reasonable access to
the relevant business records, other documents and employees of the Target
Group.

(c) The Buyer Indemnified Parties and Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to avoid production of confidential information (consistent with
Applicable Law), and to cause all communications among employees, counsel and
others representing any party to the Trewit Litigation to be made so as to
preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privileges. 

(d) To the extent any member of the Target Group is entitled to reimbursement
under an insurance policy covering the Trewit Litigation of the attorneys
fees and expenses in respect of the Trewit Litigation, Buyer shall cause such
member of the Target Group to assign and transfer such amounts to Seller upon
receipt thereof.

(e) All rights of Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified Parties set forth in this
Section 6.4 shall terminate immediately upon the nonappealable dismissal with
prejudice of Target as a defendant in the Trewit Litigation, without affecting
in any respect the respective obligations of Buyer and the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to this Section 6.4, which obligations shall continue
in full force and effect.

_6.5. _Consequential Damages__. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, no Person shall be liable under this Article VI
for any consequential, punitive, special, incidental or indirect damages,
including lost profits, except to the extent recovered by a third party in
connection with a Third Party Claim, or except to the extent the Loss arises
out of fraud by the non-claiming party.



 

60 _6.6. _Payments__. The Indemnifying Party shall pay to the Indemnified Party,
by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the amount of any Loss for
which it is liable hereunder no later than three (3) days following any final
determination of such Loss and the Indemnifying Partys liability therefor. A
"final determination" shall exist when (i) the parties to the dispute have
reached an agreement in writing, (ii) a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have entered a final and non-appealable order or judgment, or (iii) an
arbitration or like panel shall have rendered a final non-appealable
determination with respect to disputes the parties have agreed to submit
thereto.

_6.7. _Adjustments to Losses_._

_6.7.1. Insurance_. In calculating the amount of any Loss, the proceeds
actually received by the Indemnified Party or any of its Affiliates under any
insurance policy or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by
or against any other Person in each case relating to the Third Party Claim or
other claim, net of any actual costs, expenses or premiums (including any
increase in premiums directly attributable to insurance claims relating to
such Loss) incurred in connection with securing or obtaining such proceeds,
shall be deducted, except to the extent that the adjustment itself would
excuse, exclude or limit the coverage of all or part of such Loss. In the
event that an Indemnified Party has any rights against an insurer or other
third party with respect to any Loss that results in a payment by
an Indemnifying Party under this Article VI, such Indemnifying Party shall be
subrogated to such rights to the extent of such payment. Without limiting the
generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each Indemnified Party and
Indemnifying Party shall duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably
necessary to evidence and perfect the subrogation and subordination rights
detailed herein, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims.

_6.7.2. Taxes._ The amount of indemnification to which any Indemnified Party
shall be entitled under this Article VI shall be reduced by the amount of the
Tax Benefit, if any, computed at the Assumed Rate for all Taxes, such Tax
Benefit to be reduced by the cost of any Tax Detriment, computed at the
Assumed Rate, it being the intent of the parties that the indemnification
provided for in this Article VI be net of all actual income tax effects to
the Indemnified Party, and it further being the intention of the parties that
if the Tax Benefit to the Indemnified Party, if any, computed at the Assumed
Rate for all Taxes, is less than the cost of any Tax Detriment to the
Indemnified Party calculated at the Assumed Rate, that the Indemnifying Party
shall be liable to and shall further indemnify for the Indemnified Party for
the difference between the Tax Benefit and Tax Detriment. Tax Benefits
realized in a taxable period subsequent to the period in which the related
indemnification payment is made (such as the utilization of net operating
losses that arise or are increased as a result of an indemnity claim) shall
not be taken into account in computing such payment; instead the Indemnified
Party will pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amounts of such Tax Benefits
as and when they are actually realized; _provided_ the aggregate amount
required to be so paid over to the Indemnifying Party under this Section
shall not exceed the amount



 

61  of the indemnification payment made by it. The Indemnified Party will
provide the Indemnifying Party with sufficient documentation each taxable year
(which requirement may be satisfied by a certification of such partys tax
manager or other knowledgeable officer) confirming the amount of Tax Benefit
and Tax Detriment realized in such year.

_6.7.3. Reimbursement_. If an Indemnified Party recovers an amount from a
third party in respect of a Loss that is the subject of
indemnification hereunder after all or a portion of such Loss has been paid
by an Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Article VI, the Indemnified Party
shall promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of (i) the
amount paid by the Indemnifying Party in respect of such Loss, plus the
amount received from the third party in respect thereof, (net of costs
reasonably incurred directly in connection with the collection of such amounts
from the third party), less (ii) the full amount of Loss.

_6.8. _Mitigation__. In the event an Indemnified Party willfully fails to
mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the Indemnifying Party shall have no
liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have been avoided
had the Indemnified Person not willfully failed to so mitigate.

_6.9. _Claims Unaffected by Investigation__. The right of an Indemnified Party
to indemnification or to assert or recover on any claim shall not be affected
by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or
capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution
and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy of or compliance with, any of the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed
upon in writing by the parties, the written waiver of any condition based on
the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or
compliance with any covenant or agreement, shall not affect the right to
indemnification or other remedy based on such representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements.

_6.10. _Tax Indemnity__.

(a) The indemnification obligations of the parties in respect of Taxes are
not subject to the provisions of Section 6.2.1. Seller shall be liable for and
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from,
against and in respect of any and all Pre-Closing Taxes and any and all Tax
Claims resulting from, arising out of or relating to: (i) any Taxes imposed on

otherwise set forth in Section 7.2 relating to transfer Taxes, all liability
for Taxes of the Target Group arising (directly or indirectly) as a result of
the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents (including, without
limitation, Taxes imposed on or with respect to income or gain recognized by

(iii) any inaccuracy of a representation or warranty with respect to Taxes set
forth herein, (iv) all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated
combined or unitary group of which the Target Group (or any predecessor of the
Target Group) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury  



 

62  Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local or
foreign law or regulation, (v) any and all Taxes of any Person (other
than the Target Group) imposed on the Target Group as a transferee,
successor, by contract or pursuant to any law, rule or regulation, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing Date, (vi) the
transfer Taxes for which Seller is liable pursuant to Section 7.2, and (vii)
Taxes and other costs resulting from a failure on the part of Seller to take
any action required of Seller under this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that
Seller shall not be liable to indemnify Buyer under this Section 6.10(a) for
Taxes described in each of clauses (i) through (vii) above to the extent that
amounts in respect of such taxes have been adequately reflected as a current
liability in the Final Balance Sheet (and thus in Working Capital).
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
indemnification obligations of Seller pursuant to this Section 6.10(a) shall
survive until six months after the expiration of the statute of limitations
for the Taxes involved.

(b) Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to any Tax refund or credit
received by any member of the Target Group for any Pre-Closing Period (except
to the extent such refund or credit was included as an asset in the
calculation of the Final Balance Sheet).

shall constitute an adjustment to the Purchase Price for all purposes,

purposes, except as otherwise required by GAAP for financial accounting
purposes only.
