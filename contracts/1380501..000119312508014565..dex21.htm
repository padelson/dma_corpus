ARTICLE II

THE TENDER OFFER

Section 2.1. _The Offer_.

(a) Provided that this Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance
with _Section 10.1_ and no event shall have occurred and no circumstance
shall exist which would result in a failure to satisfy any of the conditions
set forth in _Annex A_ hereto (as they may be amended in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_ "), Merger Sub shall commence, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the
Exchange Act), the Offer as promptly as practicable after February 4, 2008.
The Offer Price of $10.6506 per share shall be net to each seller of shares
of Common Stock in the Offer in cash, subject to reduction for applicable
amounts withheld pursuant to _Section 2.1(f)_ below and reduction as
contemplated by _Section 8.2_ below. The Company agrees that no shares of
Common Stock held by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer. The obligation of Merger Sub to accept for payment and
to pay for any shares of Common Stock validly tendered pursuant to the Offer
shall be subject only to the Offer Conditions. A share of Common Stock which
has been properly withdrawn shall not be considered validly tendered pursuant
to the Offer, but may be re-tendered upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of the Offer. 

(b) Parent, on behalf of Merger Sub, expressly reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to waive, amend or modify any of the terms and conditions of the
Offer (including, without limitation, the Offer Conditions) in a manner not
inconsistent with this Agreement, _provided, that_ , without the prior written
consent of the Company, Parent shall not, and shall cause Merger Sub not to,
(i) decrease the Offer Price (except as permitted by this Agreement), (ii)
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer (other than by adding
consideration), (iii) decrease or limit the number of shares of Common
Stock sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive satisfaction
of the Minimum Condition; (v) amend any term or condition of the Offer in any
manner materially adverse to the holders of shares of Common Stock, or (vi)
extend the expiration of the Offer except as provided in _Section 2.1(d)_.
Merger Sub shall not, nor shall Parent cause or permit Merger Sub to, revoke,
abandon or terminate the Offer except pursuant to _Section 10.1_ or impose
additional conditions or requirements in addition to the Offer Conditions.



 

8 (c) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (i)
file or cause to be filed with the SEC a combined Schedule 13E-3 and Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed under cover of Schedule TO (together with
all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ ") and related
offer to purchase, letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and other
ancillary Offer documents and instruments pursuant to which the Offer will be
made (collectively, and including any supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and (ii) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to
the holders of shares of Common Stock as and to the extent required by
applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company agrees to promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub in writing, for inclusion in the Offer
Documents, all information concerning the Company required by applicable law
to be included in the Offer Documents or that may be reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the preparation of the
Offer Documents. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each agrees to promptly
correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents if and
to the extent that such information shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by applicable law and Merger
Sub shall, and Parent further agrees to cause Merger Sub to, take all steps
necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected or supplemented, to be
filed with the SEC and the Offer Documents, as so corrected or supplemented,
to be disseminated to holders of shares of Common Stock, in each case as and
to the extent required by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. The Company
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Offer Documents, and any amendments thereto, prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of shares of
Common Stock. Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel
with a copy of any written comments with respect to the Offer Documents from
the SEC or its staff, and shall consult with the Company regarding any
telephonic notification of any oral comments with respect to the Offer
Documents from the SEC or its staff, and shall consult with the Company and
its counsel to the extent reasonably practicable under the circumstances
before responding to any written comments with respect to the Offer Documents
from the SEC or its staff, in each case promptly after the receipt thereof.
In the event that Parent or Merger Sub receives any comments from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, each shall (i) respond promptly
to such comments and (ii) take all other commercially reasonable actions
necessary to resolve the issues raised therein.

(d) The Offer shall remain open until that date that is twenty (20)
Business Days following (and including the day of) the commencement of the
Offer or such later date to which the Offer may be extended in accordance with
this paragraph (d) (such date, or such subsequent date to which the expiration
of the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Merger Sub may, without the consent of
the Company, (i) extend and re-extend the Offer on one or more occasions for
one (1) or more periods of not more than ten (10) Business Days each, so long
as the last such extension does not cause the Acceptance Date (hereinafter
defined) to occur after April 30, 2008, if at the then-scheduled Expiration
Date any of the Offer Conditions shall not be satisfied or waived; (ii)
extend and re-extend the Offer for any period required by any rule,
regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff thereof
applicable to the Offer; and (iii) extend and re-extend the Offer on one or
more occasions for an aggregate period of not more than twenty (20) Business
Days so long as the last such extension does not cause the Acceptance Date to
occur after April 30, 2008, if the Minimum Condition has been satisfied but
less than that number of shares of Common Stock have been validly tendered
that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned
(within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act) by Parent or any of
its Affiliates or Subsidiaries, represents less than 90% of the outstanding
shares of Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis). Merger Sub (or Parent on
its behalf) may, in its sole discretion, elect to provide a
subsequent offering period for the Offer pursuant to, and on the terms
required by, Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act. Nothing contained
in this _Section 2.1(d)_ shall be construed to affect any termination rights
set forth in Article X hereof.



 

9 (e) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction
or waiver by Parent, on behalf of Merger Sub, of the Offer Conditions, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment and pay
for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer promptly after the Expiration Date (the time and date
of such acceptance for payment, the " _Acceptance Date_ "). Parent shall
provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds
necessary to purchase any and all shares of Common Stock that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

(f) Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares
of Common Stock such amounts as Merger Sub reasonably determines that it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
under any other applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Merger Sub, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

Section 2.2. _Company Action_

(a) The Company shall, after affording Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment thereon, file with the SEC on the date of the filing by
Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer Documents, a Schedule 13E-3 (the " _Company
Schedule 13E-3_") and a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (together with any amendments or supplements thereto, and including the
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") reflecting the recommendation of
the Board of Directors that holders of shares of Common Stock tender their
shares of Common Stock in response to the Offer, and shall disseminate the
Schedule 14D-9, to the extent required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the
Exchange Act and any other applicable laws to holders of shares of Common
Stock. The Schedule 14D-9 will set forth, and the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, that the Board of Directors, acting
upon the recommendation of the Special Committee, at a duly held meeting
has (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are advisable and fair to and in the best
interests of the Company and its stockholders (other than Parent and its
Affiliates), (ii) approved the Offer, the Merger, the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby in accordance with applicable law, (iii) recommended that
the holders of shares of Common Stock accept the Offer, tender their shares
of Common Stock in response to the Offer, and approve the Merger and this
Agreement (to the extent such approval is required by applicable law for the
consummation of the Merger) (such recommendations, together with the
determinations set forth in clause (i), the " _Recommendation_ "), (iv)
directed that the approval of the Merger and this Agreement be submitted for
consideration of the stockholders of the Company (to the extent required by
applicable law) and (v) taken all other action necessary to render any
Takeover Statute inapplicable to each of the Offer, the Merger, this Agreement
and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (such actions by
the Board of Directors described in the preceding clauses (i) through (v),
collectively, the " _Board Actions_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Recommendation may be withdrawn, modified or
amended to the extent permitted by Section 8.7(e). The Company hereby approves
of and consents to the Offer and consents to the inclusion in the Offer
Documents of the Board Actions. The Company has been advised by each of
its directors and officers that such person intends to tender all shares of
Common Stock owned by such person in response to the Offer. The Company agrees
that the Schedule 14D9 shall comply in all  



 

10  material respects with the requirements of applicable U.S. federal
securities laws. The Company agrees to promptly correct the Company Schedule
13E-3 and the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that either document shall
become false or misleading in any material respect or as otherwise required by
applicable law (and each of Parent and Merger Sub, with respect to written
information supplied by it specifically for use in the Company Schedule 13E-3
or the Schedule 14D-9, shall promptly notify the Company of any required
correction of such information and cooperate with the Company with respect to
correcting such information) and to amend or supplement the information
contained in the Company Schedule 13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9 to include any
information that shall become necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the
Company Schedule 13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the Companys stockholders to the extent required
by applicable U.S. federal securities laws. To the extent reasonably
practicable under the circumstances, Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Company
Schedule 13E-3 and the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the holders of shares
of Common Stock. The Company shall respond as promptly as reasonably
practicable to any comments received from the SEC with respect to the Company
Schedule 13E-3 or the Schedule 14D-9 and provide copies of such comments to
Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel promptly upon receipt thereof and
copies of proposed responses to Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel prior
to filing or disseminating and, to the extent reasonably practicable under the
circumstances, to allow comment.

(b) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall promptly
furnish to Parent and Merger Sub, or their designated agent, mailing labels
(containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the shares of
Common Stock as of a recent date and of those persons becoming record holders
subsequent to such date and, to the extent known, a list of the beneficial
owners of the shares of Common Stock as of a recent date), security position
listings, non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available listing or
computer list containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the
shares of Common Stock as of the most recent practicable date and shall
furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available information
(including, without limitation, updated lists of holders of shares of Common
Stock and their addresses, mailing labels and lists of security positions and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists as they become available) and such
other assistance as Parent and Merger Sub and their agents may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of
shares of Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable law, and
except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Offer and the Merger, Parent,
Merger Sub and their Affiliates and Representatives shall use the information
contained in any such labels, listings and files only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver
to the Company all copies of such information, in each and every form of
media, then in their possession.

Section 2.3. _Directors of the Company_.

(a) Subject to compliance with applicable law and this _Section 2.3_,
promptly upon the acceptance and payment for shares of Common Stock by Parent
or any of its Affiliates representing at least the Minimum Condition pursuant
to the Offer (the " _Share Purchase Date_ "), Parent shall be entitled to
designate all of the members of the board of directors of the Company. In
furtherance thereof, the Company shall, upon the request of Parent, promptly
take all actions in accordance with applicable law, its corporate charter and
bylaws and/or NYSE rules and regulations necessary to cause Parents designees
to be so elected or appointed (including, if necessary or requested by Parent,
securing the resignations of one or more existing directors or increasing the
size of the Board of Directors, or both), in each case in compliance with
applicable law, the Companys corporate charter and bylaws and/or NYSE rules
and  



 

11  regulations. At such time, the Company shall, if requested by Parent, also
take all action consistent with applicable law, its corporate charter and
bylaws and/or NYSE rules and regulations necessary to cause persons
designated by Parent to constitute (i) each committee of the Board of
Directors, (ii) each board of directors (or similar body) of each Company
Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or similar body) of each such board of
directors.

(b) The Companys obligations under _Section 2.3(a)_ shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 thereunder. The Company shall
promptly take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in
order to fulfill its obligations under  _Section 2.3(a)_, including mailing
to the holders of shares of Common Stock an information statement containing
the information required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1, as promptly as
practicable following the mailing of the Schedule 14D-9 (or together with the
Schedule 14D-9 if Parent has then provided the required information) and shall
include in such information statement all information with respect to the
Company and its officers and directors as is required under Section 14(f) and
Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its obligations under _Section 2.3(a)_. Parent
will supply to the Company any information with respect to itself and its
officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

Section 2.4. _Top-Up Option_.

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the " _Top-
Up Option_ ") to purchase from the Company, at a price per share equal to the
Offer Price, a number of newly issued shares of Common Stock (the " _Top-Up
Option Shares_ ") that, when added to the number of shares of Common Stock
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub at the time of
exercise of the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share of Common Stock more than
90% of the number of shares of Common Stock that will be outstanding
immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Top-Up Option
may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole but not in part, at any time on or
after the Acceptance Date hereunder and on or prior to the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the Acceptance Date or the expiration date of any
subsequent offering period; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the obligation of
the Company to deliver Top-Up Option Shares upon the exercise of the Top-Up
Option is subject to the conditions that (i) no provision of any applicable
law and no Restraint shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
delivery of the Top-Up Option Shares in respect of such exercise, (ii) the
issuance of Top-Up Option Shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option would not
require approval of the Companys stockholders under applicable law or
pursuant to any applicable securities exchange listing rules and regulations,
(iii) upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of shares of Common Stock
owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent or Merger Sub constitutes one share
of Common Stock more than 90% of the number of shares of Common Stock that
will be outstanding immediately after the issuance of the Top-Up Option
Shares, (iv) in no event shall the TopUp Option be exercisable for a number
of shares in excess of the aggregate of the number of shares of Common Stock
held as treasury shares by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and the
number of shares of Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue under
its corporate charter but that are not issued and outstanding (and are not
otherwise reserved for issuance) as of immediately prior to the exercise of
the TopUp Option and (v) Merger Sub shall have accepted for payment and paid
for all shares of Common Stock validly tendered in the Offer and not properly
withdrawn. The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-
Up Option Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable laws,
including compliance with an applicable exemption from registration of the
Top-Up Option Shares under the Securities Act.

(b) If Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall
deliver to the Company a notice setting forth (i) the number of shares of
Common Stock that will be owned, directly or indirectly, by Parent and Merger
Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares and (ii)
a place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares.
The Company  



 

12  shall, as soon as reasonably practicable following receipt of such notice,
notify Parent and Merger Sub of the number of shares of Common Stock
then outstanding and the number of Top-Up Option Shares. At the closing of
the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the
aggregate consideration required to be paid in exchange for such Top-Up Option
Shares, and the Company shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate
representing such Top-Up Option Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable
for the Top-Up Option Shares may be paid by Merger Sub by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note having a principal amount equal
to the balance of the aggregate purchase price for the Top-Up Option Shares.
Any such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 5% per annum,
shall mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery
of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. If this
Agreement is terminated after the Top-Up Option is exercised and prior to the
Effective Time, all amounts then owing pursuant to the promissory note
(including all interest) shall thereupon become immediately due and payable.

(c) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Option Shares that
Merger Sub may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be
registered under the Securities Act and will be issued in reliance upon an
exemption thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Parent
and Merger Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or
will be upon the purchase of the Top-Up Option Shares, an "Accredited
Investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Option Shares to be
acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by
Merger Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale
in connection with, any distribution thereof in violation of the Securities
Act.

ARTICLE IV

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE EQUITY SECURITIES

OF THE CONSTITUENT COMPANIES

Section 4.1. _Conversion of Securities_. As of the Effective Time, pursuant to
this Agreement and by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part
of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of shares of Common Stock:

(a) each share of Common Stock that is held by the Company as treasury stock
or owned by Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and no payment or distribution shall be
made or delivered with respect thereto;

(b) each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common
stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Company; and

(c) each share of Common Stock (including any Restricted Shares) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares
of Common Stock to be canceled in accordance with _Section 4.1(a)_) shall
automatically be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Offer
Price in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable
to the holder thereof upon surrender of the Certificate formerly representing
such share of Common Stock in the manner provided in _Section 4.2_.



 

14 Section 4.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate, or
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable
to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as agent for the payment of
the Merger Consideration. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent
immediately available funds equal to the aggregate Merger Consideration (the
" _Exchange Fund_ ") and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely
pay the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Agreement. The Exchange
Agent shall make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange
Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of Merger. The
Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all interest
earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to Parent.

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Common Stock. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing ownership of the
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided for herein. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented for any reason to the Exchange Agent, the Surviving
Company or the Companys transfer agent shall be cancelled and converted into
the Merger Consideration provided for and in accordance with the procedures
set forth in this Article IV.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time and, in any
event, not later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the Closing
Date, the Surviving Company shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to
send, to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_: (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in such form and have such
other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify); and (ii) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents reasonably satisfactory to the
Company as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent or the Surviving Company, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration payable in exchange therefor,
without interest, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. Until surrendered and exchanged as contemplated by this _Section
4.2_, each such Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration as contemplated by this _Section 4.2_. No interest shall be
paid or accrue on any cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate. In the
event of a transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed and accompanied by appropriate stock
powers or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and accompanied by all
documents reasonably required by the Exchange Agent to evidence and effect
such transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.



 

15 (d) _No Further Ownership Rights In Common Stock; Share Transfers_. At the
Effective Time, holders of shares of Common Stock shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, stockholders of the Company other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration contemplated by this Article IV. The Merger
Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
representing Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article IV
shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights and
privileges pertaining to the Common Stock exchanged theretofore represented
by such Certificates. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
capital stock of the Surviving Company with a record date after the Effective
Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates which were converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration for six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent upon demand and any holders of
shares of Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Company for payment of the Merger
Consideration (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat and other
similar law). Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Surviving Company, the Company or the Exchange Agent, or any employee,
officer, director, partner, agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable
to any Person in respect of the Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official or Governmental Authority pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by holders of Certificates as of a date immediately prior to such
time that such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become the property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
become the property of Parent on such date, free and clear of any claims or
interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent;  _provided_ , _however_
, that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United
States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the
full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or
Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of
such bank which are then publicly available). Any net profit resulting from,
or interest or income produced by, such investments, shall be placed in the
Exchange Fund and be payable to Parent. To the extent that there are losses
with respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other
reasons below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger
Consideration, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion of the
Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure that
the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to make
such payments.

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the Surviving Company or the Exchange Agent, the posting
by such Person of a bond in such amount as Parent, the Surviving Company or
the Exchange Agent may reasonably direct, the Exchange Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration into which the shares of Common Stock theretofore represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement.



 

16 (h) _Uncertificated Shares_. Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the
procedures set forth in this _Section 4.2_ to permit the payment of the
Merger Consideration in the case of any uncertificated shares of Common Stock
as if such shares were represented by certificates.

Section 4.3. _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub
or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration and other amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of any
applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld by
the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, and paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority, such deducted
or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

Section 4.4. _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall
be available with respect to the Offer, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 4.5. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

(a) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding restricted share
of Common Stock issued under a Company Incentive Plan (each a " _Restricted
Share_ ") shall vest, the restrictions thereon shall lapse, and each
Restricted Share shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 4.1(c)_. All payments
under this _Section 4.5(a)_ shall be subject to any applicable withholding
Tax.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) each independent director of
the Company who holds any outstanding and unsettled deferred compensation
units (the " _Deferred Compensation Units_ ," and each independent director
who holds any Deferred Compensation Units, a " _Participant_ ") issued under
the Independent Director Plan shall become entitled to a lump sum payment in
cash, without interest, in the aggregate amount equal to the balance credited
to such Participants deferred compensation account maintained by the Company
under the Independent Director Plan (the " _Deferred Compensation Payment_ ")
and (ii) each such Participants Deferred Compensation Units shall be
cancelled and of no further force and effect. Parent shall pay, or direct the
Exchange Agent to pay, to each Participant, the Deferred Compensation Payment
as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective Date, at which
time the Participant shall cease to possess any rights to any compensation
from the Company or the Surviving Company. For the purpose of determining the
Deferred Compensation Payment, the "Fair Market Value" of one share of Common
Stock, as such term is used in the Independent Director Plan, shall be equal
to the Offer Price.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company and each of the Company
Subsidiaries shall take all actions necessary to facilitate the
implementation of the provisions contained in this _Section 4.5_. The Company
covenants and agrees that it shall cause the Company Incentive Plans to
terminate as of the Effective Time and all awards issued under such Company
Incentive Plans shall be terminated and the provisions of any other plan,
program, arrangement or agreement providing for the issuance or grant of any
other interest in respect of equity interests of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries shall be of no further force and effect and shall be
deemed to be terminated as of the Effective Time and no holder of Restricted
Shares or any other participation in any Company Incentive Plan shall have any
right thereunder to (i) acquire any securities of the Company, the Surviving
Company or any Subsidiary thereof or (ii) receive any payment or benefit with
respect to any award previously granted under the Company Incentive Plans
except as provided in this _Section 4.5_.



 

17 (d) On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Company or
the Exchange Agent, an amount in cash sufficient to pay the amounts described
in this _Section 4.5_.

Section 4.6. _Adjustments_. If at any time during the period between the date
of this Agreement and the Effective Time any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur as a result of any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split) or subdivision or combination, exchange or readjustment
of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution, merger or other
similar transaction, the Offer Price (with respect to any such event that
becomes effective prior to the Expiration Date) and the Merger Consideration
payable per share of Common Stock shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such
change; _provided, that_ , nothing in this _Section 4.6_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement. If the Company shall declare or
pay any dividend or distribution, including, without limitation, the dividend
required by  _Section 8.2_ hereof, the Offer Price and Merger Consideration
per share of Common Stock shall be reduced by the per share amount of such
dividend or distribution.

Section 4.7. _Tax Characterization_. The parties intend that for U.S. federal,
state and local income Tax purposes, the Merger shall be treated as a taxable
purchase of Company Common Stock by Parent.

to do business and is in good standing under the laws of any other
jurisdiction in which the properties owned, leased or operated by it therein
or in which the transaction of its business makes such qualification or
licensing necessary (each such jurisdiction being listed in _Section 5.1(b)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_) except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed, or to have such power and authority would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Material
Adverse Effect, and (ii) has all requisite power and authority to own,
operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as it is

Agreement or the Offer or to consummate the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by
the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery

obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with

permits, licenses, variances, exemptions, orders, franchises,
consents, approvals and other authorizations necessary to conduct its
business as it is now being conducted and has made all necessary filings
required under any federal, state, local or foreign law except, in each case,

Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in
violation of, or in default under, any of its obligations under any such
certificate, permit, license, variance, exemption, order, franchise, consent,
approval or other authorization of any federal, state, local or foreign

21 Section 5.7. _SEC Reports_.

(a) The Company has timely filed all reports, schedules, forms, statements and
other documents required to be filed with the SEC since its
inception (collectively, the " _Company SEC Reports_ "), all of which, at the
time of filing thereof (except as and to the extent such Company SEC Report
has been modified or superseded in any subsequent Company SEC Report filed and
publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement) complied in all
material respects with all applicable requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (" _SOX_ ") and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports. As
of their respective dates (except as and to the extent modified or superseded
in any subsequent Company SEC Report filed and publicly available prior to the
date of this Agreement, in the case of Company SEC Reports filed prior to the
date hereof, or prior to the Effective Time, in the case of subsequently-filed
Company SEC Reports), none of the Company SEC Reports at the time of filing
contained, nor will any report, schedule, form, statement or other document
filed by the Company with the SEC after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted, or
will omit, to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Each of the
consolidated financial statements of the Company included or incorporated by
reference in the Company SEC Reports complied, or will comply if filed after
the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been, or will be if filed after the date
hereof, prepared in accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC
and subject to normal year end audit adjustments which would not be material
in amount or effect) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly presented, or
will fairly present if filed after the date hereof, in accordance with
the applicable requirements of GAAP and the applicable rules and regulations
of the SEC, the assets, liabilities and the consolidated financial position of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole, as of the dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations, stockholders equity and
cash flows for the periods then ended (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, which are
subject to normal, recurring adjustments, none of which are material). No
Company Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act.

(b) There are no liabilities of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries of any kind whatsoever, whether or not accrued and whether or not
contingent or absolute or determined other than (i) liabilities disclosed in
or reserved against or provided for on the face of the unaudited balance
sheet in the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Company
included in the Company SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof (the "
_Balance Sheet_ ") or reasonably apparent from the notes thereto, (ii)
liabilities incurred on behalf of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii)
liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice since the date of the Balance Sheet and which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The management of the Company has (i) implemented and maintains disclosure
controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act)
to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries, is made known to the management of the
Company, and (ii) the Companys management has disclosed, based on its
most recent evaluation, to the Companys outside auditors and the audit
committee of the Board of Directors (A) all significant deficiencies and
material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which
are reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud or allegation
of fraud whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys or any of the Companys
Subsidiaries internal controls over financial reporting.



 

22 (d) The Company has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or
operation of the Companys internal control over financial reporting. To the
knowledge of the Company, there is no reason to believe that its auditors and
its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not be able to
give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of SOX when next due.

(e) There is and has been no failure on the part of the Company or any of the
Companys directors or officers, in their capacities as such, to comply in all
material respects with any provision of SOX applicable to them and the rules
and regulations promulgated in connection therewith.

as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act
applicable thereto and any other applicable law as of the date of such filing.

(a) There is no litigation, suit, arbitration, claim, investigation, action or
proceeding pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
against the Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective
properties or assets that, individually or in the aggregate, constitutes or
would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any such litigation, suit, arbitration,

would reasonably be expected to prohibit the Offer, the consummation of the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby.

(c) Since their inception, each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
has been operated at all times in compliance with all laws applicable to
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or by which any property,
business or asset of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries is bound
or affected, except for such failures as would not, individually or in the
aggregate,  



 

23  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received written notification of
violation of, and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
knowledge of any claim alleging the violation of, any applicable law, except
for violations and notices that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The Company has not taken any action, nor have any other steps been taken
or have any legal proceedings been commenced, nor to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened, against the Company, for the winding up, liquidation or

Section 5.10. _Absence of Certain Changes_. Except as disclosed in _Section
5.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, since December 31, 2007, (a) there

Adverse Effect, (b) the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
has been conducted only in the ordinary course consistent with past practice
and (c) none of the actions set forth in _Section 7.1_ have occurred.

Section 5.11. _Taxes_.

 

(a) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries (i) has timely filed (or
had filed on their behalf) all Tax Returns required to be filed by any of
them (after giving effect to extensions) and all such Tax Returns are true,
correct and complete in all material respects and (ii) has paid (or had paid
on their behalf) all material Taxes that are required to be paid by it
(whether or not shown on a Tax Return), in each case, other than with respect
to matters contested in good faith or adequately reserved against or provided
for (in accordance with GAAP) in the Companys financial statements.

(b) The most recent financial statements contained in the Covered SEC Reports
reflect an adequate reserve (excluding any reserve for deferred
Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax income)
for all Taxes payable by the Company or Company Subsidiaries for all taxable
periods and portions thereof through the date of such financial statements,
and Taxes payable by the Company or its Company Subsidiaries on the Closing
Date will not materially exceed such reserve as adjusted through the Closing
Date in accordance with the past custom and practice of the Company or its
Company Subsidiaries in filing their Tax Returns.

(c) All material Taxes which the Company or its Subsidiaries are required by
law to withhold or collect, including Taxes required to have been withheld in
connection with amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party and sales, gross receipts and use
Taxes, have been duly withheld or collected and, to the extent required, have
been paid over to the proper Governmental Authority.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has executed or
filed with the IRS or any other taxing authority any agreement, waiver or
other document or arrangement extending the period for assessment or
collection of Taxes that remains in effect.

(e) Commencing with the Companys taxable year ended December 31, 2007, the
Company (i) has satisfied and will satisfy (as applicable) all requirements

of the Code (a " _REIT_ "), (ii) has been organized and operated in a manner
consistent with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT,
and (iii) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to permit it to
continue to be eligible to qualify as a REIT through the Effective Time. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company has not taken or omitted to take any
action (other than approving this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby) which  



 

24  action or omission could reasonably be expected to result in a loss of its
status as a REIT, and no claim has been asserted by a Tax authority that
the Company will not be taxable as a REIT, which claim is pending or has been
threatened in writing.

any "prohibited transactions" within the meaning of Section 857(b)(6) of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds any asset the
disposition of which would be subject to the "built-in gains" rules set forth
in Treasury Regulation Section 1.337(d)-7. The Company has incurred no
liability for any Taxes under Sections 857(b), 860(c) or 4981 of the Code,
including Tax imposed with respect to redetermined rents, redetermined
deductions or excess interest, and neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has incurred material liability for Taxes other than in the

the preceding sentence will be imposed on the Company or any Company
Subsidiary.

(g) The Company has no earnings and profits attributable to it or any other
corporation in any non-REIT year within the meaning of Section 857 of the
Code. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has made any election,
and is not required, to treat any of its assets or the assets of any
Subsidiary as owned by another person for Tax purposes (other than by reason
of a Subsidiary being a "qualified REIT subsidiary" or a "disregarded entity"
for federal income tax purposes and any comparable provision of state, local
or foreign law).

(h) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has requested a
private letter ruling from the IRS or a comparable ruling from other Tax
authorities.

(i) Each Company Subsidiary that is a partnership, joint venture or limited
liability company has since the date it became a Company Subsidiary been
treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a partnership or disregarded
entity, as the case may be, and not as a corporation or an association
taxable as a corporation. Each Company Subsidiary that is a corporation
qualifies as a "qualified REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of Section
856(i) of the Code, or as a "taxable REIT subsidiary," within the meaning of
Section 856(l) of the Code.

(j) As of the date hereof, there are no audits, examination or other
proceedings relating to any Taxes of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pending, or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing and all
assessments made with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
result of any examination by the IRS or any taxing authority have been paid
in full.

claim by any taxing authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any
Company Subsidiary does not file income Tax Returns that it is or may be
subject to income taxation by that jurisdiction.

(l) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any Tax
sharing or allocation agreement other than any agreement solely between
the Company and any Company Subsidiary.

(m) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any liability for the
Taxes of another Person other than the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(i) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law), or (ii) as a transferee or successor.



 

25 (n) There are no Liens for Taxes (other than Taxes not yet due and payable)
upon any of the assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(o) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has participated in a
"reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4(b).

(p) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock
qualifying for the Tax treatment set forth in Section 355 of the Code (i) in
the two years prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) in a distribution
with constitutes part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" (within
the meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code) which involves the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 5.12. _Properties_. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
owns any real property. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has
good title to all personal property owned by it (the " _Company Property_ "),
in each case free and clear of all Liens, except as would not reasonably be
expected to materially and adversely affect the value of such property. Any
real property or personal property held under lease by the Company is held
under a lease which is valid, binding and enforceable against the Company
and, to the Companys knowledge, the other party thereto, except as may be
limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws
affecting creditors rights generally, and by general principles of equity,
or exceptions that are not, individually or in the aggregate, material to the
Company and would not reasonably be expected to interfere with the use made or
proposed to be made of such property by the Company.

Section 5.13. _Labor and Employment Matters_. Neither the Company nor any of
the Company Subsidiaries has any employees.

Section 5.14. _Employee Benefit Plans_. Neither the Company, any Company
Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate thereof maintains, contributes to or has
an obligation to contribute to or has any liability with respect to any
Employee Program, or has ever done so, and neither the Company, any Company
Subsidiary nor any ERISA Affiliate otherwise has or has had any liability
(direct or indirect) under ERISA. For purposes of this _Section 5.14_, the
term "ERISA Affiliate" means any person or trade or business required to be
aggregated with the Company under Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
or Section 4001 of ERISA, except that ERISA Affiliate does not include Parent
or any of Parents Affiliates other than the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

Section 5.15. _No Brokers_. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has entered into any Contract, arrangement or understanding with
any Person or firm which may result in the obligation of such entity or
Parent and Merger Sub to pay any finders fees, brokerage or agents
commissions or other like payments in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that the Company has retained The
Blackstone Group (the " _Company Financial Advisor_ ") as its financial
advisor in connection with the Merger. Prior to the date of this Agreement,
the Company has delivered to Parent and Merger Sub a true, correct and
complete copy of all agreements between the Company and the Company Financial
Advisor under which the Company Financial Advisor could be entitled to any
payment relating to the Merger or such other transactions.

Section 5.16. _Opinion of Financial Advisor_. The Board of Directors has
received an opinion of the Company Financial Advisor to the effect that, as
of the date of this Agreement, the consideration to be received by holders of
shares of Common Stock (other than Parent or its Subsidiaries) pursuant to the
Offer and the Merger, taken together, is fair, from a financial point of view,
to such holders.



 

26 Section 5.17. _Material Contracts_.

(a) _Section 5.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ sets forth a list of
all Material Contracts in effect as of the date of this Agreement. The

and enforceable in accordance with their respective terms and in full force
and effect with respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, and, to the knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, with
respect to each other party to any of such Material Contracts, except, in each
case, where such failure to be so legal, valid, binding and enforceable and
in full force and effect would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect, and except to the extent
that enforcement of rights and remedies created by any Material Contracts are
subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws of general application related to or affecting
creditors rights and to general equity principles. Except as set forth in 
_Section 5.17(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, (i) neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation of or in default under (nor does

notice or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any Material
Contract to which it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or
assets is bound and, (ii) to the knowledge of the Company, there are no such
violations or defaults (nor does there exist any condition which upon the
passage of time or the giving of notice or both would cause such a violation
or default) with respect to any third party to any Material Contract, except

a Material Adverse Effect.

business, operations, officers or directors of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries or under which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries are
insured and each contract with any insurer regarding such coverage. There is
no claim by the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending under any such
policies which both (a) has been denied or disputed by the insurer and (b)
would reasonably be likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect. All material insurance policies are in full force

employed by them, and have not received any notice of infringement of or

which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
violation) of (i) any material term, condition or provision of the
organizational documents of the Company or of any of the Company Subsidiaries
(for the avoidance of doubt, any provision that relates in any way to the
qualification of the Company as a real estate investment trust for federal
income tax purposes shall be deemed to be material), (ii) any term, condition
or provision of any loan or credit agreement or any note, bond, mortgage,

time from the Solicitation Period End Date and continuing until the earlier

Agreement pursuant to Article X, if the Company or any of its Representatives
receives an unsolicited written Competing Proposal that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and independent financial advisor, (i) constitutes a Superior Proposal
or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal, then
the Company may take the following actions: (x) furnish non-public information
to the  



 

39  Person making such Competing Proposal (if, and only if, prior to so

confidentiality provisions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement) and
(y) engage in discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to
such Competing Proposal.

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event no later than 24 hours)
notify Parent if the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or its or their
Representatives receives (i) any Competing Proposal or (ii) any inquiry or
request for discussions or negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal,
including during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Solicitation Period End Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly (and in
any event no later than 24 hours) of the identity of such Person and provide
a copy of such Competing Proposal, inquiry or request (or, where no such copy
is available, a written description of such Competing Proposal, inquiry or
request), including any material modifications thereto or to any Competing
Proposal made by an Excluded Party. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a current basis (and in any event no later than 24 hours) after
the occurrence of any material changes or developments of the status of any
Competing Proposal, inquiry or request (including the material terms and
conditions thereof and of any material modification thereto). Without limiting
the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) notify
Parent orally or in writing if it determines to begin providing or making
available information or to engage in discussions or negotiations concerning a
Competing Proposal pursuant to _Section 8.7(c)_. The Company agrees that it
will not enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent
to the date hereof which prohibits the Company from providing any such
information to Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the period from
the date of this Agreement to the Solicitation Period End Date, the Company
shall not be required to disclose the identity of the Person making a
Competing Proposal nor shall the Company be required to keep Parent informed
as to the status of any discussions or negotiations with such Person unless
there has been a material modification to the financial terms of the Competing
Proposal or in the event the Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisor, that such Competing Proposal (i) constitutes a Superior
Proposal or (ii) could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal
in which case the Company shall promptly (within 24 hours) notify Parent
orally or in writing of such facts.

(e) Other than in accordance with this _Section 8.7_, the Board of Directors
shall not (i) change, qualify, withdraw or modify, or propose publicly to
change, qualify, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Recommendation by the Board of Directors of the Offer, the Merger or this
Agreement or the other transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) approve, adopt
or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, adopt or recommend, any
Competing Proposal; (iii) make any recommendation in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer other than a recommendation against such offer (each
of the foregoing actions specified in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), a " _Change
of Recommendation_ "); or (iv) authorize the Company to enter into any letter
of intent, merger, acquisition, or similar agreement with respect to any
Competing Proposal other than any confidentiality agreement to be entered into
by the Company as contemplated by this _Section 8.7_ (each a " _Company
Acquisition Agreement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that, in response to the
receipt of a Superior Proposal that has not been withdrawn or abandoned, the
Board of Directors may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, make either (x) a Change of Recommendation and/or (y) terminate
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ to enter into a Company
Acquisition Agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a " _Superior
Termination_ "); _provided further_ , that, the Board of Directors may not
effect such Change of Recommendation or a Superior Termination, in each case
in connection with a Superior Proposal, unless both of the following
conditions have been met:



 

40 (A) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least
three (3) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its
intention to effect a Change of Recommendation and/or Superior Termination in
response to such Superior Proposal, which notice shall in addition specify the
material terms and conditions (including price) of any such Superior Proposal
(including the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the Superior
Proposal), and contemporaneously with providing such notice shall have
provided a copy of the relevant proposed acquisition agreement and other
material documents related thereto ( _provided,_ that, no information need be
provided regarding the terms, structure or other financial information
regarding any debt financing commitments) with the party making such Superior
Proposal; and

(B) prior to effecting such Change of Recommendation and/or Superior
Termination in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall
cause its legal and financial advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Competing Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal.

(f) If during the Notice Period any revisions are made to the Superior
Proposal to which the final proviso of _Section 8.7(e)_ applies and the Board
of Directors or any committee thereof in its good faith judgment determines
such revisions are material (it being agreed that any change in the purchase
price in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a material revision), the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub and to comply with the requirements of such proviso with respect to such
new written notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, no "stop-look-and-listen" communication to the Companys
shareholders of the nature contemplated by Rule 14d-9 of the Exchange
Act shall be deemed to constitute a Change of Recommendation. Upon the
occurrence of a Superior Termination involving the payment of all cash for
100% of the shares of the Companys common stock, Parent shall, and shall
cause all of its Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to cause the
transaction contemplated by the Superior Proposal to be consummated,
including, without limitation, tendering shares of Common Stock owned by
Parent or its Affiliates, agreeing to vote all shares of Common Stock owned
by Parent or its Affiliates in favor of the transaction contemplated by the
Superior Proposal, and taking all other commercially reasonable actions
requested by the Company to effectuate the transactions contemplated by the
Superior Proposal, including without limitation, the termination of the
Management Agreement and all other Contracts between the Company on the one
hand and Parent or its Affiliates on the other hand, with such termination to
be effective immediately prior to consummation of the transaction
contemplated by the Superior Proposal. In connection with the termination of
the Management Agreement contemplated by the previous sentence,
notwithstanding any terms of the Management Agreement to the contrary, the
Company shall, contemporaneously with such termination, pay to Parent in cash
50% of the Termination Fee. " _Termination Fee_ ," for the purpose of this
_Section 8.7(f)_ shall have the meaning ascribed to such term in Section 1
of the Management Agreement.

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Board of
Directors from making a Change of Recommendation to the extent that the Board
of Directors determines in good faith, for reasons not related to the receipt
of a Competing Proposal, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
counsel, that the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable law.

(h) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, the Board of
Directors may at any time take and disclose to its holders of shares of Common
Stock a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, may issue a stop, look and listen announcement and may make
any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange  



 

41  Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither
the Company nor the Board of Directors shall be permitted to recommend a
Competing Proposal which is not a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ ,
that any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, an express rejection of a Competing Proposal or an express reaffirmation
of the Recommendation to its stockholders in favor of the Offer and the Merger
shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation.

(i) Except in connection with the Companys entry into a Company Acquisition
Agreement in accordance with this _Section 8.7_, the Company shall not take
any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates)
from any Takeover Statute.

Section 8.8.  _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_.

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation existing
in favor of, and all limitations on the personal liability of, each present
and former director and officer of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
provided for in the respective charters or bylaws (or other applicable
organizational documents) or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall
survive the Merger (and, with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
that is not the surviving entity of the Merger, shall be reflected in the
applicable organizational documents of each such entity) and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms; _provided_ , _however_ , that
all rights to indemnification in respect of any claims (each a " _Claim_ ")
asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such Claim; _provided_ , _further however_ , that the
provisions of this Section 8.8(a) shall not apply to, nor be enforceable by,
any director of the Company who voluntarily resigns (other than as a result
of death, physical incapacity or serious illness) from his or her position as
a director of the Company on or prior to the earlier to occur of the
Acceptance Date or the date of termination of this Agreement.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and Surviving Company shall,
jointly and severally, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
law, indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in respect of each of the
foregoing) each current and former director and officer of the Company and any
of the Company Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs,
executors or administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by
law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and amounts paid
in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or at the
Effective Time (including without limitation the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) in connection with such persons serving as an officer,
director or other fiduciary of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of
the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions of this Section
8.8(b) shall not apply to, nor be enforceable by, any director of the Company
who voluntarily resigns (other than as a result of death, physical incapacity
or serious illness) from his or her position as a director of the Company on
or prior to the earlier to occur of the Acceptance Date or the date of
termination of this Agreement.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall be entitled to, and shall,
purchase a "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall
survive the Merger), of at least the same coverage and amounts containing
terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the directors and officers
of the Company and each Company Subsidiary as the Companys and the Company
Subsidiaries  



 

42  existing policy or policies, and from insurance carriers with comparable
credit ratings, for the benefit of the current and former officers and
directors of the Company and each Company Subsidiary with a claims period of
six years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance for claims arising from facts or events that occurred at
or prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the Surviving Company shall
jointly and severally be liable for the payment of all premiums in respect of
such "tail" insurance policy or policies. In addition to, and not to the
exclusion of or as an alternative to, the foregoing requirement that the
Company acquire "tail" insurance coverage, if the Company shall receive notice
that its existing management protection policy with ACE American Insurance
Company and/or either or both of its excess policies with Illinois National
Insurance Company and XL Specialty Insurance Company will expire, terminate or
not be renewed at any time after the date hereof but before the Effective
Time, the Company shall immediately, but in no event later than one (1)
Business Day after such expiration, termination or non-renewal, exercise any
and all rights to continue, extend or otherwise make claims under such
policies to the fullest extent permitted by the terms of such policies and pay
all premiums owed in connection with the exercise of such rights, it being
the express intention of the parties that the officers and directors of the
Company be afforded the fullest protection available under the Companys
existing insurance policies.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.8(a) and Section 8.8(b) of this
Agreement, if Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Company or
such transferees, as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in
this _Section 8.8_.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.8(a) and Section 8.8(b) of this
Agreement, the rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in
addition to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party
may have under any organizational documents of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company, any other indemnification
agreement or arrangement, applicable law or otherwise. The agreements and
covenants contained herein shall not be deemed to be exclusive of any other
rights to which any Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to law,
contract or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be
construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and
officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this _Section 8.8_ is not prior to,
or in substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

Section 8.9. _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent shall consult
with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any
public statements with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided,
however_ , that a party may, without the prior consent of the other party,
issue such press release or make such public statement as may be required by
law or the applicable rules of any national securities exchange if the party
issuing such press release or making such public statement has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain
such partys consent but has been unable to do so prior to the time such press
release or public statement or filing is required to be released or furnished
pursuant to such law or rules.

(c) By the Company, prior to the Acceptance Date:

(i) if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the
part of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred,
or any condition pursuant to _Section 9.1_ shall not have been satisfied,
which would prevent Parent or Merger Sub from consummating the transactions

Company shall each bear one-half of the costs of filing, printing and mailing
the Offer Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement/Information
Statement to the Companys stockholders. As used in this Agreement, "expenses"
means the out-of-pocket fees and expenses of any advisors, counsel and
accountants, incurred by the party or on its behalf in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, and the out-of-pocket
expenses of the preparation, printing, filing and mailing of the Offer
Documents, the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement/Information Statement
and the solicitation of Company Stockholder Approval.

(b) _Termination Fees_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary if:

(i) (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement, any Competing Proposal
(for purposes of this Subsection, substituting 50% for the 15% threshold set

disclosed or otherwise made known to the Company prior to, and not withdrawn
at or prior to the time of, the relevant termination (each, a " _Qualifying
Transaction_ "), (B) this Agreement is terminated by Parent or the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(b)(i)_ and (C) concurrently with or within twelve
(12) months after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive
agreement with respect to or consummates any Qualifying Transaction, then the
Company shall, concurrently with the consummation of the Qualifying

") (in any event net of any Parent Expense Reimbursement previously paid or
payable by the Company);

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company on or prior to the sixth
(6th) Business Day following the Solicitation Period End Date pursuant to

$3,700,000 in cash (the " _Excluded Party Break-Up Fee_ ") (in any event net
(but not less than $0.00) of any Parent Expense Reimbursement previously paid
or payable by the Company); _provided_ , _however_ , that if the initial
Notice Period begins on or prior to the sixth (6th) Business Day following the
Solicitation Period End Date, such sixth (6th) Business Day shall be tolled
until the end of all applicable Notice Periods with respect to that specific
Excluded Party for which such written notice was delivered pursuant to
_Section 8.7(e)(A)_ and the Company shall be entitled to pay the
Excluded Party Break-Up Fee rather than the Break-Up Fee as required by
_Section 10.3(b)(iii)_ below if the Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)(ii)_ immediately following the end of all
applicable Notice Periods as a result of the Superior Proposal made by such
Excluded Party;



 

46 (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to  _Section
10.1(c)(ii)_ (A) in connection with a Superior Proposal made by a Person other
than an Excluded Party, or (B) except as provided in _Section 10.3(b)(ii)_

Period End Date in connection with a Superior Proposal made by an Excluded
Party, the Company shall, concurrently with the consummation of such Superior
Proposal, pay to Parent the Break-Up Fee;

(iv) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)(ii)_
(unless the Company terminated this Agreement pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_
in connection with such Change of Recommendation), _Section 10.1(d)(iii)_ or
_Section 10.1(d)(iv)_, the Company shall pay to Parent, within two (2)
Business Days of such termination, the Break-Up Fee.

(c) If: (A) prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Competing Proposal
(for purposes of this Subsection, substituting 50% for the 15% threshold set
forth in the definition of Competing Proposal) or the bona fide intention of
any Person to make a Competing Proposal is publicly proposed or publicly
disclosed or otherwise made known to the Company prior to, and not withdrawn
at or prior to the time of the Company Stockholder Meeting, and (B) following
the occurrence of an event described in the preceding clause (A), this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to  _Section
10.1(b)(i)_ then, the Company shall pay to Parent or its designees, as
promptly as possible (but in no event later than two (2) Business Days
following termination) following the delivery by Parent of an invoice
therefor, all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses
incurred by Parent and Merger Sub in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expense Reimbursement_ ").

(d) The Excluded Party Break-Up Fee, the Break-Up Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement, as applicable, shall be paid in each case by wire transfer
of same day funds as directed by the Company, reasonably in advance and, once
paid, the Excluded Party Break-Up Fee, the Break-Up Fee and the Parent Expense
Reimbursement (in the case where the Excluded Party Break-Up Fee or the Break-
Up Fee is not otherwise payable) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
available to Parent and Merger Sub following termination of this Agreement.
Upon payment of the Excluded Party Break-Up Fee or the Break-Up Fee and/or the
Parent Expense Reimbursement (in the case where the Excluded Party Break-Up
Fee or the Break-Up Fee is not otherwise payable), as applicable, the Company
shall have no further liability with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby to Parent, Merger Sub, their shareholders,
Affiliates or otherwise. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall the Company be required to (i) pay both the
Excluded Party Break-Up Fee and the Break-Up Fee or (ii) pay either such fee
on more than one occasion. Any such payments shall be reduced by any amounts
as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under applicable Tax
law.

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, the Parent and Merger Sub would not have
entered into this Agreement. In the event that the Company shall fail to pay
the Excluded Party Break-Up Fee, the Break-Up Fee or the Parent Expense
Reimbursement when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent and/or Merger Sub,
as applicable, for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or
accrued by Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, (including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and enforcement
of this  _Section 10.3_. Each of the Parties acknowledges that the Excluded
Party Break-Up Fee, the Break-Up Fee and the Parent Expense Reimbursement, as
applicable, are, under the circumstances of this Agreement, reasonable
compensation for damages that Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, expects to
suffer in the circumstances in which such fees are payable.



 

47 Section 10.4. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or
modified only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each
party to this Agreement at any time before or after obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, but, after the Company Stockholder Approval, no
amendment shall be made that by law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange or quotation system requires further approval by such
stockholders without obtaining such further approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the
parties hereto.

Section 10.5. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time,
the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other parties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto and (c) subject to the provisions of _Section 10.4_, waive
compliance by the other parties with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of the party against which such waiver or extension is to be
enforced. The failure of a party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 11.3. _Non-Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and
Agreements_. None of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Share Purchase Date or the termination of
this Agreement, except for those representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein and therein which by their terms apply in whole
or in part and which contemplate performance after the Share Purchase Date or

Share Purchase Date or the termination of this Agreement, as the case may be.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, solely in the event
of a Superior Termination, Parents obligations set forth in _Section 8.7(f)_
shall survive until such time as the transaction contemplated by such
Superior Termination is completed or abandoned. EACH PARTY HERETO AGREES THAT,
EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT,
NEITHER PARENT, MERGER SUB NOR THE COMPANY MAKES ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR
WARRANTIES, AND EACH HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES
MADE BY ITSELF OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, FINANCIAL AND LEGAL ADVISORS OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVES (OTHER THAN AS
SET FORTH IN THE CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT), WITH RESPECT TO THE EXECUTION AND
DELIVERY OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE OFFER OR THE MERGER, NOTWITHSTANDING THE
DELIVERY OR DISCLOSURE TO THE OTHER OR THE OTHERS REPRESENTATIVES OF
ANY DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO ANY ONE OR MORE OF THE
FOREGOING. NOTHING CONTAINED IN THIS SECTION 11.3 WILL BE CONSTRUED AS A
WAIVER OF A CLAIM FOR FRAUD.



 

49 Section 11.4. _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The parties hereto recognize
and agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the
parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions hereof in any federal or state court located in the State of
Maryland, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or
in equity. In the event that any action shall be brought in equity to enforce
the provisions of this Agreement, no party shall allege, and each party hereby
waives the defense, that there is an adequate remedy at law.

Section 11.5. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the Parent
Disclosure Schedule, constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
hereto and supersedes all of the prior agreements and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 11.6. _Assignment_. Except as expressly permitted by the terms hereof,
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations
hereunder shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of
law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Parent may delegate or assign
(without any further consent of any parties) all or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any Affiliate of Parent, provided, however, that no
such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

Section 11.7. _Third Party Beneficiaries_. The terms and provisions of this
Agreement are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their
respective successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of
the parties to confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other person
except as provided in _Section 8.8_.

Section 11.8. _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the
application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement, and the application of such
provision to other persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby,
and to such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.

Section 11.9. _Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction_.

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Maryland.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
submits to the sole and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of
Maryland or any court of the United States located in the State of Maryland
(the " _Maryland Courts_ ") for any litigation arising out of or relating to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this
Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby (and agrees not to commence
any litigation relating thereto except in such courts), waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such litigation in the Maryland Courts and
agrees not to plead or claim in any Maryland Court that such litigation
brought therein has been brought in any inconvenient forum. Each of the
parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent such party is not otherwise subject
to service of process in the State of Maryland, to appoint and maintain an
agent in the State of Maryland as such partys agent for acceptance of legal
process, and (b) that service of process may also be made on such party by
prepaid certified mail with a proof of mailing receipt validated by the United
States Postal Service constituting evidence of valid service. Service made
pursuant to (a) or (b) above shall have the same legal force and effect as if
served upon such party personally within the State of Maryland.



 

50 Section 11.10. _Waiver_. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any investigation
by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the
party taking such action of compliance with any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be
construed as a waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any
other provision hereunder.

Section 11.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any suit, action or other proceeding arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Each party hereto (a)
certifies that no Representative or any other has represented, expressly
or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any action, suit or
proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement,
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this _Section
11.11_.

Section 11.12. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party. Facsimile transmission
of any signed original document shall be deemed the same as delivery of an
original. At the request of any party, the parties will confirm facsimile
transmission by signing a duplicate original document.

rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange
Act), Merger Sub will not be required to accept for payment, and may delay
the acceptance for payment of, any validly tendered shares of Common Stock
unless a number of shares of Common Stock representing at least 55% of the sum
of (x) the total number of outstanding shares of Common Stock not owned by
Parent and its Affiliates plus (y) the total number of shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants, conversion privileges
and other similar rights shall not have been validly tendered prior to the
expiration of the Offer (" _Minimum Condition_ "). Furthermore,
notwithstanding any other provision of the Offer (subject to the Agreement and
any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under
the Exchange Act), Merger Sub will not be required to accept for payment or
pay for any validly tendered shares of Common Stock if:

been terminated;

(b) there shall be pending any suit, action, or proceeding brought by any
Governmental Authority, (i) challenging the acquisition by Parent or Merger
Sub of the shares of Common Stock, seeking to make illegal, materially delay,
make materially more costly or otherwise directly or indirectly restrain or
prohibit the making or consummation of the Offer and the Merger or the
performance of any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
seeking to obtain from the Company, Parent or Merger Sub any damages or
penalties that are material in relation to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as whole; (ii) seeking to prohibit or materially limit the
ownership or operation by the Company, Parent or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any of the businesses or assets of the Company,
Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or to compel the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to
dispose of or hold separate all or any material portion of the businesses or
assets of the Company or Parent, as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any
of the other transactions contemplated by the Agreement; (iii) seeking to
impose material limitations on the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to acquire
or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any shares of Common Stock
accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer including, without limitation, the
right to vote the shares of Common Stock accepted for payment by it on all
matters properly presented to the stockholders of the Company; (iv) seeking
to prohibit Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates from effectively
controlling in any material respect the business or operations of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries; (v) requiring divestiture by Merger Sub or any
of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates of any shares of Common Stock; or (vi) which
otherwise would, if adversely determined, have a Material Adverse Effect;

(c) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation, executive order, decree,
ruling, judgment, decision, order or injunction (including with respect
to competition or antitrust matters) enacted, entered, promulgated, issued or
enforced by any Governmental Authority, or any statute, rule, regulation,
executive order, decree, ruling, judgment, decision, order or injunction which
has been proposed by any Governmental Authority with respect to or reasonably
deemed applicable (following consultation with outside legal counsel) to, or
any material consent or approval withheld with respect to (i) Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii) the
Offer or the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the
Agreement, by any court or other Governmental Authority, other than applicable
waiting periods    under the HSR Act as specified in the introductory paragraph above, in any
case, that has resulted or, in the reasonable judgment of Parent
following consultation with outside legal counsel, is reasonably likely to
result, directly or indirectly, in any of the consequences referred to in
clauses (i) though (vi) of paragraph (b) above;

(d) (i) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in the
Agreement that are qualified by reference to materiality or Material Adverse
Effect shall not be true and correct, and the other representations and
warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement shall not be true and
correct in all material respects, in each case at the date hereof and as of
the consummation of the Offer with the same effect as if made at and as of
the consummation of the Offer (except to the extent such representations and
warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which case such
representations and warranties that are qualified by reference to materiality
or Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct as of such earlier date,
and such other representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all
material respects as of such earlier date); or (ii) the Company shall have
failed to perform or comply in all material respects with its covenants and
obligations contained in the Agreement, which failure to perform has not been
cured within five (5) Business Days after the giving of written notice to the
Company;

(e) there shall have occurred since the date of the Agreement any events or
changes which, individually or in the aggregate, constitute or may reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;

any event shall have occurred which gives Parent or Merger Sub the right (i)
to terminate the Agreement pursuant to Article X or (ii) not to consummate the
Merger;

(g) there shall have occurred and be continuing (i) any general suspension of
trading in, or limitation in prices for securities on any national securities
exchange or in the over-the-counter market (other than as a result of market
circuit-breakers or other similar procedures); (ii) the declaration of a
banking moratorium or any suspension of payments in respect of banks in the
United States (whether or not mandatory); or (iii) any limitation (whether or
not mandatory), by a United States Governmental Authority or agency on the
extension of credit by banks or other financial institutions which in the
reasonable judgment of Parent or Merger Sub, in any such case, makes it
inadvisable to proceed with the Offer or with such acceptance for payment or
payments;

(h) all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, authorizations, notices,
reports or other filings required to be obtained or made by the Company,
Parent or Merger Sub with or from any Governmental Authority or third party in
connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the Agreement, the
Offer and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement
shall not have been made or obtained and such failure could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or

(i) Parent shall have failed to receive a certificate from the Company, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, executed by the Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, dated as of the
scheduled expiration of the Offer, to the effect that the conditions set forth
in paragraph (d) of this _Annex A_ have been satisfied.

Subject to the provisions of Section 2.1 of the Agreement, the foregoing
conditions are solely for the benefit of Parent and Merger Sub and may be
waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time and from time
to time in their sole discretion. The failure by Parent or Merger Sub at any
time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of
any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts
and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing
right which may be asserted at any time and from time to time. Capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ and not herein defined shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement to which it is annexed.
