Information   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   This Agreement and Plan of
Merger (this "Agreement") is made as of October 25, 2000, among State
Automobile Mutual Insurance Company, an Ohio mutual insurance company
("Parent"), MIGI Acquisition Corp., an Indiana corporation and a wholly-
owned subsidiary of Parent ("MergerCo"), and Meridian Insurance Group, Inc.,
an Indiana corporation (the "Company").  Background Information   A. The
respective Boards of Directors of MergerCo and the Company have approved the
merger of MergerCo with and into the Company (the "Merger") in accordance
with the Indiana Business Corporation Law (the "IBCL" or the "Merger Law"),
and, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, holders of common shares of the Company ("Old Common") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (as hereinafter
defined), other than Parent, will be entitled to the right to receive cash.
It is intended that the Merger will qualify, for federal income tax purposes,
as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code (as defined below).  
B. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board") has, in light
of and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement,
determined that the Merger Consideration (as hereinafter defined) to be paid
for each share of Old Common in the Merger is fair to the shareholders of
the Company and that the Merger is otherwise advisable and fair to and in
the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company Board has
approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated or required by this
Agreement, including the Merger (collectively, the "Transactions"), and
has recommended approval and adoption by the shareholders of the Company of
this Agreement and the Transactions. In addition, concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, Parent and Meridian Mutual (as defined below)
are entering into an Agreement to Merge (the "Mutual Company Agreement"), the
transactions contemplated by which are intended to be consummated
immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger.   C. MergerCo, Parent
and the Company (collectively, the "Parties") desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Transactions and to prescribe various conditions to the
Transactions.  Statement of Agreement   The Parties acknowledge the
accuracy of the foregoing Background Information and agree as
follows:  ARTICLE I THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, the Company
and MergerCo shall consummate the Merger pursuant to which (a) MergerCo
shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of MergerCo shall thereupon cease, (b) the Company shall be the
successor or surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter
referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall continue to be governed
by the laws of the State of Indiana, and (c) the separate
corporate existence of the Company with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected
by the Merger. The articles of incorporation of the Company (the "Articles
of Incorporation"), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation from and
after the Effective Time until further amended in accordance with law and
such Articles of Incorporation. The bylaws of the Company (the "Bylaws") as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until further amended
in accordance with law, the Articles of Incorporation and such Bylaws. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the Merger Law.   1.2 Closing.
Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the transactions
contemplated herein shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 9.1, and
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in
Article VIII hereof, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., Columbus, Ohio, time, on the second business day
after satisfaction or waiver (by the applicable party entitled to the benefit
thereof) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VIII hereof (the
"Closing Date"), at the offices of Baker and Hostetler LLP, 65 East State
Street, Suite 2100, Columbus, Ohio 43215, unless another time, date or place
is agreed to in writing by the Parties.   1.3 Effective Time. As soon as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement, the Parties shall
cause this Agreement to be provided to the commissioners or
superintendents of insurance, as applicable (each, an "Insurance
Commissioner"), of the respective states of domicile of the Company
Subsidiaries (as defined below) in accordance with the applicable
insurance laws of such states (collectively, the "Insurance Laws"). Subject
to the conditions set forth in Article VIII of this Agreement, on the Closing
Date, MergerCo and the Company shall duly execute and file articles of merger
(the "Articles of Merger") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Indiana, each in accordance with the Merger Law, and the Merger shall become
effective (the "Effective Time") upon the last to occur of (a) the filing of
the Articles of Merger with the Indiana Secretary of State and (b) such later
time as the Parties may agree to designate in such filing; provided, however,
that the Effective Time shall not be more than 31 (thirty-one) days from the
date of approval by the last Insurance Commissioner to approve the Merger.
Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Parties
shall use all reasonable efforts to assure that the filings contemplated
hereby are made, and the Effective Time occurs, as soon as is
practicable.   1.4 Directors and Officers. The directors and officers
of MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in
accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, the vice chairman
of the Surviving Corporation and the president of the Surviving
Corporation, effective as of the Effective Time, shall be Norma J. Oman
and Steven R. Hazelbaker, respectively, each of whom shall hold such office
from and after the Effective Time in accordance with the Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   ARTICLE
II EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT
CORPORATIONS   2.1 Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of
shares of Old Common or any holder of shares of capital stock of
MergerCo:   (a) Capital Stock of MergerCo. Each common share of  MergerCo
(the "MergerCo Common Stock") issued and  outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be  converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable  share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (b)
Cancellation of Treasury Stock and MergerCo-Owned  Stock. Each share of Old
Common, and all other shares of  capital stock of the Company, that are owned
by Meridian  Mutual Insurance Company, an Indiana mutual insurance  company
("Meridian Mutual"), the Company, or any Subsidiary  (as defined below) of
the Company (a "Company Subsidiary")  and all shares of Old Common and other
shares of capital  stock of the Company owned by MergerCo or Parent, shall
be  canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no  consideration
shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange  therefor.   2.2 Conversion
of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of MergerCo, the Company or the holders of any shares of
Old Common:   (a) Subject to the other provisions of this Section  2.2 and
to Section 3.1(i), each share of Old Common issued  and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time,  excluding shares of Old Common
owned by Meridian Mutual, the  Company, any Company Subsidiary, MergerCo, or
Parent, shall  be converted into the right to receive Thirty Dollars and 
Zero Cents ($30.00) per share, payable in cash to the holder  thereof,
without any interest thereon (the "Merger  Consideration"), upon surrender of
the Certificate (as  defined below) representing such share of Old
Common.   (b) All such shares of Old Common, when converted as  provided in
Section 2.2(a), shall no longer be considered  outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired  and shall cease to exist, and each
Certificate previously  evidencing such shares shall thereafter represent
only the  right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided  herein. The
holders of Certificates (as defined below)  previously evidencing shares of
Old Common outstanding  immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have  any rights with respect to the Old Common except as  otherwise
provided herein or by law and, upon the surrender  of Certificates in
accordance with Section 3.1, shall only  have the right to receive for their
shares of Old Common the  Merger Consideration as provided herein, without
any  interest thereon.   2.3 Company Stock Options and Related Matters.
As of and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, each outstanding
option, warrant or similar right (including any related stock appreciation
right) (an "Option") issued, awarded or granted pursuant to any plan,
agreement or arrangement of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
entitling the holder thereof to purchase one or more shares of Old Common
(the "Company Stock Plans") shall, as of the Effective Time, become fully
vested regardless of the vesting schedule contained in any Option agreement
or any of the Company Stock Plans. At the Effective Time, after giving effect
to any such vesting, each Option shall be canceled, and each holder of a
canceled Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration for
the cancellation of such Option, an amount in cash equal to the result
obtained when the number of shares of Old Common with respect to which such
canceled Option has not been exercised as of the cancellation of such Option
is multiplied by the excess of the Merger Consideration over the exercise
price per share of such canceled Option (such result obtained, the "Spread").
The total consideration to be paid for the cancellation of all Options is
hereinafter referred to as the "Option Cancellation Consideration." The
amount of Option Cancellation Consideration to be delivered to the holder of
any such Options shall be subject to reduction to satisfy applicable
withholding tax obligations. With respect to each such Option, the Company
shall take, or cause to be taken, prior to the Effective Time, all
such action so that each such Option shall be automatically canceled as of
the Effective Time and the holders of each such Option shall only be entitled
to receive from the Surviving Corporation, at the Effective Time or as soon
as practicable thereafter, an amount in cash equal to the Spread, if any, in
exchange for the cancellation of such Option, subject in each case to
applicable withholding tax obligations.   ARTICLE III PAYMENT FOR
SHARES   3.1 Payment for Shares of Old Common.   (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, MergerCo shall  appoint a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the  Company to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent").
At  or prior to the Effective Time, MergerCo shall deposit, or  MergerCo
shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause  to be deposited, with the
Exchange Agent in an account (the  "Exchange Fund") the aggregate Merger
Consideration to which  holders of shares of Old Common shall be entitled at
the  Effective Time pursuant to Section 2.2(a).   (b) Promptly after the
Effective Time, MergerCo shall  cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
record holder of  certificates (the "Certificates") that immediately prior
to  the Effective Time represented shares of Old Common a form  of letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery  shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the  Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the  Certificates to the Exchange Agent.   (c) In effecting the payment of
the Merger  Consideration with respect to shares of Old Common  represented
by Certificates entitled to payment of the  Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.2(a) (the "Cashed  Shares"), upon the surrender of each such
Certificate, the  Exchange Agent shall pay the holder of such Certificate
the  Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of Cashed  Shares, in
consideration therefor. Upon such payment such  Certificate shall forthwith
be canceled.   (d) From and after the Effective Time until  surrendered in
accordance with paragraph (c) above, each  Certificate representing shares of
Old Common shall  represent solely the right to receive the Merger 
Consideration relating thereto. No interest or dividends  shall be paid or
accrued on the Merger Consideration. If the  Merger Consideration (or any
portion thereof) is to be  delivered to any person other than the person in
whose name  the Certificate formerly representing shares of Old Common 
surrendered therefor is registered, it shall be a condition  to the right to
receive such Merger Consideration that the  Certificate so surrendered be
properly endorsed or otherwise  be in proper form for transfer and that the
person  surrendering such shares of Old Common shall pay to the  Exchange
Agent any transfer or other taxes required by  reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a  person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate  surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the 
Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not  applicable.   (e)
Promptly following the date which is 180 days  after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver  to the Surviving Corporation all cash,
Certificates and  other documents in its possession relating to the 
Transactions, and the Exchange Agent\'s duties shall  terminate. Thereafter,
each holder of a Certificate formerly  representing shares of Old Common may
surrender such  Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and (subject to 
applicable abandoned property, escheat and similar laws)  receive in
consideration therefor the Merger Consideration  relating thereto without any
interest or dividends thereon.   (f) After the Effective Time, there shall
be no  transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving  Corporation
of any shares of Old Common which were  outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If,  after the Effective Time, Certificates formerly
representing  shares of Old Common are presented to the Surviving 
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be surrendered  and canceled in
return for the payment of the Merger  Consideration relating thereto, as
provided in this Article  III.   (g) None of MergerCo, the Company or the
Exchange  Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash  from
the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in  good faith pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property,  escheat or similar law.   (h) If any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or  destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by  the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or  destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the 
provision of reasonable and customary indemnity against any  claim that may
be made against it with respect to such  Certificate, the Exchange Agent
shall issue in exchange for  such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
Merger  Consideration payable to such person pursuant to this 
Agreement.   (i) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to  deduct and
withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise  payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of shares  of Old Common such amounts as the
Surviving Corporation is  required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making  of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as  amended
(the "Code"), or any provision of state, local or  foreign tax law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld  by the Surviving Corporation, such
withheld amounts shall be  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been  paid to the holder of the shares of Old Common with respect  to
which such deduction and withholding was made by the  Surviving
Corporation.   ARTICLE IV REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF MERGERCO AND
PARENT   4.1 Representations and Warranties of MergerCo. MergerCo and
Parent, jointly and severally, hereby represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:   (a) Organization. MergerCo is a corporation duly  organized and
validly existing, for which the most recent  required biennial report has
been filed in the office of the  Indiana Secretary of State and no articles
of dissolution  have been filed in such office, and has all requisite 
corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental  approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to  carry on its business as now
being and proposed to be  conducted, except where the failure to be so
organized,  existing and in good standing or to have such power,  authority,
and governmental approvals would not reasonably  be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the  business, results of operations or condition
(financial or  otherwise) of MergerCo (a "MergerCo Material Adverse 
Effect").   (b) Authorization; Validity of Agreement; Necessary  Action.
MergerCo has all requisite corporate power and  authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to  consummate the Transactions. The execution,
delivery and  performance by MergerCo of this Agreement and the 
consummation of the Transactions have been duly authorized  by the Board of
Directors of MergerCo (the "MergerCo Board")  and by the shareholders of
MergerCo, and no other corporate  action on the part of MergerCo is necessary
to authorize the  execution and delivery by MergerCo of this Agreement and
the  consummation of the Transactions. This Agreement has been  duly
executed and delivered by MergerCo and, assuming the  due and valid
authorization, execution and delivery hereof  by the Company, is a valid and
binding obligation of  MergerCo enforceable against MergerCo in accordance
with its  terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,  moratorium
or other similar laws relating to creditors\'  rights generally and to
general principles of equity.   (c) Ownership. MergerCo is a wholly owned
Subsidiary  of Parent.   (d) Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except
for  filings, permits, authorizations, consents and approvals as  may be
required under, and other applicable requirements of,  applicable Insurance
Laws, the Securities Exchange Act of  1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
the HSR Act (as  hereinafter defined), and state securities or state "Blue 
Sky" laws, none of the execution, delivery or performance of  this Agreement
by MergerCo, the consummation by MergerCo of  the Transactions or compliance
by MergerCo with any of the  provisions hereof will (i) conflict with or
result in any  breach of any provision of the articles of incorporation or 
bylaws of MergerCo, (ii) require any filing with, or permit,  authorization,
consent or approval of, any Governmental  Entity (as hereinafter defined),
(iii) result in a violation  or breach of, or constitute (with or without due
notice or  lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise to any right  of
termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any of  the terms,
conditions or provisions of any note, bond,  mortgage, indenture, lease,
license, contract, agreement or  other instrument or obligation to which
MergerCo is a party  or by which it or any of its properties or assets may
be  bound, or (iv) violate any order, writ, injunction, decree,  statute,
rule, regulation or other law applicable to  MergerCo or any of its
properties or assets, excluding from  the foregoing clauses (ii), (iii) and
(iv) such violations,  breaches or defaults which would not, individually or
in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a MergerCo  Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement,  "Governmental Entity" means
any governmental or quasi-  governmental authority including, without
limitation, any  federal, state, territorial, county, municipal or other 
governmental or quasi-governmental agency, board, branch,  bureau,
commission, court, department or other  instrumentality or political unit or
subdivision, whether  domestic or foreign.   (e) Formation of MergerCo; No
Prior Activities.  MergerCo was formed solely for the purpose of engaging
in  the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. As of the  date hereof
and as of the Effective Time, except for (i)  obligations or liabilities
incurred in connection with its  incorporation or organization and the
transactions  contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) this Agreement and 
any other agreements or arrangements contemplated by this  Agreement or in
furtherance of the transactions contemplated  hereby, MergerCo has not
incurred, directly or indirectly,  through any subsidiary or affiliate, any
obligations or  liabilities or engaged in any business activities of any 
type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or  arrangements with
any person.   4.2 Representations and Warranties of Parent. Parent hereby
represents and warrants to the Company as follows:   (a) Organization.
Parent is a corporation duly  organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the  laws of its state of formation and has all requisite 
corporate power and authority and all necessary governmental  approvals to
own, lease and operate its properties and to  carry on its business as now
being conducted, except where  the failure to be so organized, existing and
in good  standing or to have such power, authority, and governmental 
approvals would not reasonably be expected to have a  material adverse effect
on the business, results of  operations or condition (financial or otherwise)
of Parent  (a "Parent Material Adverse Effect").   (b) Authorization;
Validity of Agreement; Necessary  Action. Parent has all requisite power and
authority to  execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the 
Transactions (subject to the authorizations, consents, and  approvals
described in Section 4.2(c), below). The  execution, delivery and performance
by Parent of this  Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have
been  duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of  Parent and no
other action on the part of Parent is  necessary to authorize the execution
and delivery by Parent  of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions.  This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by 
Parent and, assuming due and valid authorization, execution  and delivery
hereof by the Company, is a valid and binding  obligation of Parent
enforceable against Parent in  accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy,  insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws relating
to  creditors\' rights generally and to general principles of  equity.  
(c) Consents and Approvals; No Violations. Except for  filings, permits,
authorizations, consents and approvals as  may be required under, and other
applicable requirements of,  applicable Insurance Laws, the Exchange Act, the
HSR Act,  and state securities or state "Blue Sky" laws, none of the 
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by  Parent, the
consummation by Parent of the Transactions or  compliance by Parent with any
of the provisions hereof will  (i) conflict with or result in any breach of
any provision  of the organizational documents of Parent, (ii) require any 
filing with, or permit, authorization, consent or approval  of, any
Governmental Entity, (iii) result in a violation or  breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or  lapse of time or both) a default (or give
rise to any right  of termination, cancellation or acceleration) under, any
of  the terms, conditions or provisions of any note, bond,  mortgage,
indenture, lease, license, contract, agreement or  other instrument or
obligation to which Parent is a party or  by which it or any of its

injunction, decree,  statute, rule, regulation or other law applicable to

suits,  proceedings, investigations or claims pending against  MergerCo or
Parent, at law or in equity, or before or by any  court, commission,
governmental department, board, bureau,  agency, administrative officer or

or before any arbitrator, that would, individually or in the  aggregate,
reasonably be expected to prevent or delay the  consummation of the
Transactions or to have a Parent  Material Adverse Effect or a MergerCo
Material Adverse  Effect, as the case may be.   (e) No Brokers. Neither
MergerCo nor Parent has  entered into any contract, arrangement or

connection with the negotiations  leading to this Agreement or consummation
of the  Transactions.   (f) Compliance with Laws. MergerCo and Parent are

Instruments. Neither Parent nor  any of its Subsidiaries has received a
written notice that  Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of or

other material contract,  agreement, arrangement or understanding, to which
it is a  party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is  bound,
nor does any violation or default exist, except to  the extent such violation
or default would not, individually  or in the aggregate, have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect  or a MergerCo Material Adverse Effect, as the case

contains,  or will contain as of the Effective Time, any untrue  statement
of a material fact or omits, or will omit as of  the Effective Time, a
material fact necessary to make the  statements contained herein or therein
not misleading.   ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY   Except as set forth in the disclosure schedules delivered at or
prior to the execution hereof to MergerCo (the "Company Disclosure
Schedule"), the Company represents and warrants to Parent and MergerCo as
follows:   5.1 Existence; Good Standing; Authority; Compliance With
Law.   (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized and  validly
existing, for which the most recent required  biennial report has been filed
in the office of the Indiana  Secretary of State and no articles of
dissolution have been  filed in such office. The Company is duly licensed
or  qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in  good
standing under the laws of any other state of the  United States in which the
ownership of its property or the  conduct of its business makes such
qualification necessary,  except where the failure to be so licensed or
qualified or  in good standing would not, individually or in the  aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect (as
hereinafter defined). For purposes of  this Agreement, an event shall be
deemed to have a "Company  Material Adverse Effect" if such event has a
material  adverse effect on the business, results of operations or 
condition (financial or otherwise) of the Company and the  Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole; provided, however,  that the effects of
changes that are generally applicable to  (i) the insurance industry and the
markets for insurance and  insurance-related products and the other
industries and  markets in which the Company and the Company Subsidiaries 
operate or (ii) the United States securities markets for  debt and equity
securities, shall be excluded from the  determination of a Company Material
Adverse Effect; and  provided, further, that any adverse effect on the
Company or  the Company Subsidiaries resulting from the announcement of 
Parent\'s proposal to acquire the Company, the execution and  announcement of
this Agreement, or the Transactions or  regulatory approvals contemplated
hereby shall also be  excluded from the determination of a Company Material 
Adverse Effect. The Company has all requisite corporate  power and authority
to own, operate, lease and encumber its  properties and carry on its business
as now conducted.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 5.1 of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company Subsidiaries is a  corporation duly
incorporated, validly existing and in good  standing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of  incorporation, has the corporate power and authority to
own  its properties and to carry on its business as it is now  being
conducted, and is duly qualified to do business and is  in good standing in
each jurisdiction in which the ownership  of its property or the conduct of
its business requires such  qualification, except for jurisdictions in which
such  failure to be so qualified or to be in good standing would  not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect.   (c)
Except as set forth in Section 5.1 of the Company  Disclosure Schedule, to
the knowledge of the Company, the  Company and the Company Subsidiaries
possess all licenses,  permits and other authorizations required to conduct
their  businesses as now conducted by them, except where the  failure to
possess such licenses, permits and other  authorizations would not,
individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse  Effect. Each Company Subsidiary (i) possesses an
Insurance  License (as defined below) in each jurisdiction in which it  is
required to possess an Insurance License and (ii) is duly  authorized in its
jurisdiction of incorporation and each  other applicable jurisdiction to
write each line of business  reported as being written in the Company
Subsidiary SAP  Statements (as defined below). All such Insurance Licenses, 
including, but not limited to, authorizations to transact  reinsurance are in
full force and effect without amendment,  limitation or restriction, other
than as described in the  Company Disclosure Schedule, and, to the
Company\'s  knowledge, there is no event, inquiry or Proceeding (as  defined
below) which is reasonably likely to lead to the  revocation, amendment,
failure to renew, limitation,  suspension or restriction of any such
Insurance License.   (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.1 of the Company 
Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, the  Company and the
Company Subsidiaries are in compliance with  all applicable laws, statutes,
orders, rules, regulations,  policies or guidelines promulgated, or
judgments, decisions  or orders entered, by any federal, state or local court
or  governmental authority applicable to the Company or to any  of the
Company Subsidiaries or to their respective  businesses or properties
(collectively, the "Applicable  Laws"), except where the failure to comply
would not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to 
have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   5.2 Authorization, Validity and
Effect of Agreements. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as
applicable, has the requisite power and authority to enter into
the Transactions and to execute and deliver this Agreement. The Company
Board has approved this Agreement and the Transactions. Subject only to the
approval of this Agreement by the holders of the Old Common, the execution by
the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions have
been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of
the Company. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and, subject to approval by holders of the Old Common, and assuming
due and valid authorization, execution and delivery thereof by MergerCo and
Parent, constitutes a valid and legally binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors\' rights generally and to general principles
of equity.   5.3 Capitalization. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 20,000,000 shares of Old Common and 500,000 preferred

(b) zero shares of Preferred Stock were issued and outstanding; and (c)
445,302 shares of Old Common and zero shares of Preferred Stock were held in
the treasury of the Company. All such issued and outstanding shares of Old
Common have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except as set forth in Section
5.3 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, (i) there are no outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the right to
vote (or which are convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the shareholders of the Company on any matter, (ii) there
are no outstanding options, warrants, calls, subscriptions, convertible
securities, or other rights, agreements or commitments which obligate the
Company to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock of the
Company, (iii) there are no outstanding contractual obligations of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock, partnership interests or any other
securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, and (iv) neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary is under any obligation, contingent or
otherwise, by reason of any agreement to register the offer and sale or
resale of any of its securities under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the
"Securities Act"). As of the date hereof, there are no declared but unpaid
dividends outstanding with respect to the Old Common.   5.4 Subsidiaries.
Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of the
Company Subsidiaries. Except as set forth in Section 5.4 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, the Company owns directly or indirectly each of
the outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity interests of each of
the Company Subsidiaries free and clear of all liens, pledges, security
interests, claims or other encumbrances. Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of each of the Company Subsidiaries that is a corporation has
been duly authorized and validly issued and is fully paid and nonassessable.
Except as set forth in Section 5.4 of the Company Disclosure Schedule or in
Schedule D to the Company\'s or any Company Subsidiary\'s statutory annual
statement as amended from time to time to reflect the Company\'s or such
Company Subsidiary\'s investment activity in the ordinary course
of business, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary owns directly or
indirectly any interest or investment (whether equity or debt) in any
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, business,
trust or other entity (other than investments in short-term investment
securities and trade receivables).   5.5 No Violation; Consents. Neither
the execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement nor the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions in accordance with the
terms hereof will conflict with or result in a breach of any provisions of
the Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws, or other organizational documents of
the Company or of any Company Subsidiary. Except as set forth in Section 5.5
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of the Company, the
execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and consummation by
the Company of the Transactions in accordance with the terms hereof will
not violate, or conflict with, or result in a breach of any provision of, or
constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse of time or
both, would constitute a default) under, or result in the termination or in a
right of termination or cancellation of, or accelerate the performance
required by, or result in the creation of any lien, security interest, charge
or encumbrance upon any of the properties of the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries under, or result in being declared void, voidable or without
further binding effect, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of (a) any
note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust or (b) any license, permit,
contract, agreement or obligation to which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is a party, or by which the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or any of their properties is bound, except as would not (i)
prevent or delay consummation of the Merger in any material respect or
otherwise prevent the Company from performing its obligations under this
Agreement in any material respect, or (ii) individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Other than the filings provided for in the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (the "HSR Act"), and the Exchange
Act or applicable state securities and "Blue Sky" laws, and other than
filings required by the Insurance Commissioners and state Governmental
Entities with regulatory authority over the Company Subsidiaries, the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not, and the
performance of this Agreement by the Company and consummation of the
Transactions do not, require any consent, approval or authorization of,
or declaration, filing or registration with, any governmental or regulatory
authority, except as would not (A) prevent or delay consummation of the
Merger in any material respect or otherwise prevent the Company from
performing its obligations under this Agreement in any material respect or
(B) individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.   5.6 SEC Documents; Financial
Matters.   (a) The Company has filed all forms, reports and  documents
required to be filed by it with the SEC  (collectively, the "Company SEC
Reports"), in accordance  with the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
rules and  regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Securities Laws").  Each
of the consolidated balance sheets of the Company  included in or
incorporated by reference into the Company  SEC Reports (including the
related notes and schedules)  fairly presents in all material respects the
consolidated  financial position of the Company and the Company 
Subsidiaries as of its date, and each of the consolidated  statements of
income, retained earnings and cash flows of  the Company included in or
incorporated by reference into  the Company SEC Reports (including any
related notes and  schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the 
results of operations, retained earnings or cash flows, as  applicable, of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for  the periods set forth therein
(subject, in the case of  unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments  which would not be material in amount or effect), in each  case
in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles ("GAAP")
consistently applied during the periods  involved, except as may be noted
therein and except, in the  case of the unaudited statements, as permitted by
Form 10-Q  pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.   (b) The
Company has previously made available to  Parent and MergerCo true and
complete copies of the  following: (i) the Annual Statements (as defined
below) for  each Company Subsidiary as of and for the years ended  December
31, 1997, 1998 and 1999; (ii) the Quarterly  Statement (as defined below) for
each Company Subsidiary as  of and for the calendar quarters ended March 31,
June 30,  and September 30, 2000; (iii) any supplemental or separate 
statutory annual statements or quarterly statements for any  Company
Subsidiary for any of the periods ended December 31,  1997, 1998 or 1999 or

Governmental Entity  and that differ from the Annual Statements or the
Quarterly  Statements described in Section 5.6(b)(i) or (ii), above;  and
(iv) the audited SAP (as defined below) balance sheets  of each Company
Subsidiary as of December 31, 1997, 1998 and  1999 and the related audited

with the notes related thereto and the reports thereon of 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (collectively with the items  described in Section
5.6(b)(i), (ii) and (iii), the "Company  Subsidiary SAP Statements"). Since
December 31, 1999, the  Company has filed, or caused to be filed, all SAP
Statements  required to be filed with or submitted to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities, except for such filings or  submissions, the failure
so to file or submit is not,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
likely to have  a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each Company Subsidiary 
SAP Statement complied (and, as to SAP Statements filed  after the date of
this Agreement, will comply) in all  material respects with all Applicable
Laws when so filed,  and all material deficiencies with respect to any such 
Company Subsidiary SAP Statement have been cured or  corrected. Each Company
Subsidiary SAP Statement (and the  notes related thereto) referred to in
Section 5.6(b)(i),  (ii) and (iv), above, was prepared (and, as to SAP 
Statements filed after the date of this Agreement, will be  prepared) in
accordance with SAP and presents (and, as to  SAP Statements filed after the
date of this Agreement, will  present) fairly, in all material respects, the
financial  position of the Company Subsidiary to which such SAP  Statement
applies as of the respective dates thereof and the  related summaries of
operations and changes in capital and  surplus and cash flows of such Company
Subsidiary for the  respective periods covered thereby. To the Company\'s 
knowledge, each Company Subsidiary SAP Statement (including  the notes
related thereto) referred to in Section  5.6(b)(iii) hereof was prepared (or,
in the case of similar  SAP Statements filed after the date of this
Agreement, will  be prepared) in accordance with the statutory accounting 
practices required by the insurance Governmental Entity in  the jurisdiction
in which such statement was (or will be)  filed.   (c) Except as set forth
in Section 5.6(c) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule, with respect to each
Company  Subsidiary, the aggregate actuarial reserves and other  actuarial
amounts held in respect of Liabilities (as defined  below) with respect to
Insurance Contracts (as defined  below) of such Company Subsidiary as
established or  reflected in its December 31, 1999 Annual Statement and in 
its September 30, 2000 Quarterly Statement: (i)(A) were  determined in
accordance with generally accepted actuarial  standards consistently applied,
(B) were fairly stated, in  all material respects, in accordance with sound
actuarial  principles, and (C) were based on actuarial assumptions that  are
in accordance with or are more conservative than those  specified in the
related Insurance Contracts; and (ii)  complied with, in all material
respects, the requirements of  the Insurance Law of the jurisdiction
applicable to such  Company Subsidiary. Each Company Subsidiary owns Assets
(as  defined below) that qualify as admitted assets under  applicable
Insurance Laws in an amount at least equal to the  sum of such Company
Subsidiary\'s statutory reserves and  other similar amounts.   5.7
Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports or as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect, to the knowledge of the Company there are no
actions, suits, proceedings, investigations or claims pending or
threatened against the Company, at law or in equity, or before or by
any court, commission, governmental department, board, bureau, agency,
administrative officer or executive, or instrumentality (including, without
limitation any actions, suits, proceedings or investigations with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), whether federal, state,
local or foreign, or before any arbitrator.   5.8 Absence of Certain
Changes. Except as set forth in Section 5.8 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports filed after
December 31, 1999, since January 1, 2000, the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses in the ordinary course
of business and there has not been: (a) any event or events that have taken
place that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect or (b) except as required by SAP or
any Applicable Law, any action taken by the Company that would require

this Agreement.   5.9 Taxes.   (a) Except as set forth in Section 5.9 of
the Company  Disclosure Schedule, each of the Company and the Company 
Subsidiaries has filed all Tax Returns (as hereinafter  defined) which the
Company was required to file (after  giving effect to any filing extension
granted by a  Governmental Entity), and has paid all Taxes (as hereinafter 
defined) required to be paid by it, except, in each case,  where the failure
to file such Tax Returns or pay such Taxes  would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
To the  knowledge of the Company, no deficiencies for any Taxes have  been
proposed, asserted or assessed against the Company or  any of the Company
Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers  of the time to assess any such
Taxes are pending. Except as  set forth in Section 5.9 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule,  neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a
party to  any Tax sharing agreement, or agreement for an exemption  with any
Governmental Entity.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "Taxes" means
all  federal, state, local and foreign income, property, sales,  franchise,

and the Company Subsidiaries own or  lease all machinery, equipment and other
tangible personal  property and assets necessary for the conduct of their 
business as presently conducted, except where the absence of  such ownership
or leasehold interest would not, individually  or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and the  Company Subsidiaries own good title, free and clear of all 
Liens, to all of the personal property and assets reflected  in the Form 10-K
or in a Company SEC Report filed subsequent  to the filing of the Form 10-K,

required, approved by the insurance regulatory  authorities of any state in
which such policies and forms  are required to be filed, except where the

interest on cash values or as claim benefits) or otherwise  share in the
benefits, revenue or profits of the Company or  any Company Subsidiary,
provided that the practice in  certain instances of making dividends based

not violate the representation contained in  this sentence. Except as
incurred in the ordinary course of  business, neither the Company nor any

likely to have a  Company Material Adverse Effect; all such filings
complied  with all Applicable Laws in all material respects when  filed; and
no material deficiencies have been asserted with  respect to any such filings
which have not been satisfied in  all material respects. All outstanding
insurance policies,  annuity contracts and assumption certificates issued by

required under Applicable Laws, on forms approved  by the insurance
regulatory authority of the jurisdiction  where issued and utilize premium
rates which if required to  be filed with or approved by insurance
regulatory  authorities have been so filed or approved, except where the 
failure to file or obtain the approval of such premium rates  would not be
reasonably likely to have a Company Material  Adverse Effect, and the
premiums charged conform thereto,  except where the failure to conform would
not have a Company  Material Adverse Effect;   (i) To the Company\'s
knowledge, no other party to any  reinsurance, coinsurance or other similar

its relationship with the Company or such Company Subsidiary.   5.22 Rating

from a breach of Section 7.5(a)  herein and (ii) the Company Board determines
that such  Acquisition Proposal is reasonably likely to lead to a  Superior
Acquisition Proposal (as hereinafter defined), then  the Company, acting
through the Company Board, shall, in  accordance with applicable law:   (A)
Duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a  special meeting of its
shareholders (the "Special  Meeting") as soon as practicable following the 
execution of this Agreement for the purpose of  considering and taking action
upon this Agreement and  the Transactions; and   (B) Together with MergerCo
prepare and file with  the SEC a preliminary proxy statement relating to
this  Agreement and the Transactions, and use its reasonable  efforts to (1)
obtain and furnish the information  required to be included by the SEC in a
definitive  proxy statement (the "Proxy Statement") and, after  consultation
with MergerCo, respond promptly to any  comments made by the SEC with respect
to the  preliminary proxy statement and cause the Proxy  Statement to be
mailed to its shareholders, and (2)  obtain the necessary approval of this
Agreement and the  Transactions by its shareholders; and (3) include in  the
Proxy Statement the recommendation of the Company  Board that shareholders of
the Company vote in favor of  the approval of this Agreement and the
Transactions.   (b) MergerCo and Parent shall furnish all information 
about themselves, their business and operations and their  owners and all
financial information to the Company as may  be reasonably necessary in
connection with the preparation  of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
give Parent and  MergerCo and their counsel the opportunity to review,
prior  to their being filed with, or sent to the SEC, (i) the Proxy 
Statement and (ii) all amendments and supplements to the  Proxy Statement and
all responses to requests for additional  information and replies to
comments. Each of the Company,  on the one hand, and MergerCo, on the other
hand, agrees to  correct promptly any information provided by it for use in 
the Proxy Statement if and to the extent that such  information shall have
become false or misleading in any  material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all  necessary steps to cause the Proxy Statement as so
corrected  to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the 
shareholders of the Company, in each case, to the extent  required by
applicable Securities Laws. The Company shall  notify MergerCo of the receipt
of any comments of the SEC  with respect to the preliminary proxy
statement.   (c) None of the information supplied by the Company 
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in  (i) the Proxy
Statement, or (ii) the Other Filings (as  hereinafter defined) will, at the
respective times filed  with the SEC or other Governmental Entity and, in
addition,  in the case of the Proxy Statement, as of the date it or any 
amendment or supplement thereto is mailed to shareholders  and at the time of
any meeting of shareholders to be held in  connection with the Merger,
contains any untrue statement of  a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required  to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the  statements therein, in light of the circumstances under  which they are
made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement,  insofar as it relates to the
Company or other information  supplied by the Company for inclusion therein,
will comply  as to form in all material respects with the requirements of 
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated  thereunder. The
Company makes no representation, warranty or  covenant with respect to
information concerning MergerCo or  Parent or their affiliates included in
the Proxy Statement  or information supplied by MergerCo or Parent or their 
affiliates for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.   (d) None of the
information supplied by MergerCo or  Parent or their affiliates specifically
for inclusion or  incorporation by reference in (i) the Proxy Statement, or 
(ii) the Other Filings, will, at the respective times filed  with the SEC or
other Governmental Entity and, in addition,  in the case of the Proxy
Statement, as of the date it or any  amendment or supplement thereto is
mailed to shareholders  and at the time of any meeting of shareholders to be
held in  connection with the Merger, contain any untrue statement of  a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required  to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the  statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under  which they are made, not misleading. The Proxy
Statement,  insofar as it relates to MergerCo or Parent or their  affiliates
or other information supplied by MergerCo or  Parent or their affiliates for
inclusion therein, will  comply as to form in all material respects with
the  requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and  regulations
promulgated thereunder. MergerCo and Parent make  no representations,
warranties or covenants with respect to  information concerning the Company
included in the Proxy  Statement or information supplied by the Company for 
inclusion in the Proxy Statement.   7.2 Other Filings. As promptly as
practicable, each of the Company and MergerCo shall prepare and file any
other filings required under the Exchange Act or any other federal or state
law relating to the Merger and the Transactions (including filings, if any,
required under the HSR Act) (collectively, the "Other Filings"). Each of the
Company and MergerCo shall promptly notify the other of the receipt of any
comments on, or any request for amendments or supplements to, any of the
Other Filings by the SEC or any other Governmental Entity or official, and
each of the Company and MergerCo shall supply the other with copies of all
correspondence between it and each of its Subsidiaries and representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or the members of its staff or any other
appropriate governmental official, on the other hand, with respect to any of
the Other Filings. Each of the Company and MergerCo shall use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain and furnish the information required to be included in
any of the Other Filings. MergerCo hereby covenants and agrees to use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to secure termination of any waiting
periods under the HSR Act and obtain the approval of the Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other Governmental Entity required for
consummation of the Transactions.   7.3 Additional Agreements. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts (a) to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective as promptly as practicable the
Transactions and to cooperate with each other in connection with the
foregoing, including the taking of such actions as are necessary to obtain
any necessary consents, approvals, orders, exemptions or authorizations by or
from any public or private third party, including without limitation
any that are required to be obtained under any federal, state or local law
or regulation or any contract, agreement or instrument to which MergerCo, the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by which any of their
respective properties or assets are bound, (b) to defend all lawsuits or
other legal proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of
the Transactions, (c) to cause to be lifted or rescinded any injunction or
restraining order or other order adversely affecting the ability of the
parties to consummate the Transactions, (d) to effect all necessary
registrations and Other Filings, including without limitation filings under
the HSR Act, if any, and submissions of information requested by
any Governmental Entity and (e) to execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to
carry out fully the purposes of this Agreement. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in Sections
8.1 and 8.3 hereof are satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the
control of the Company, and MergerCo and Parent will use their reasonable
best efforts to ensure that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1 and 8.2
hereof are satisfied, insofar as such matters are within the control
of MergerCo and Parent.   7.4 Fees and Expenses. Except as set forth in
Section 9.2 hereof, whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such costs or expenses.  
7.5 No Solicitations.   (a) The Company represents and warrants that it
has  terminated any discussions or negotiations relating to, or  that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition  Proposal (as hereinafter
defined). Except as explicitly  permitted hereunder, the Company shall not,
and shall not  authorize or permit any of its officers, directors or 
employees or any investment banker, financial advisor,  attorney, accountant
or other representative retained by it,  directly or indirectly, to (i)
solicit, initiate or  encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public 
information), or take any other action to facilitate, any  inquiries or the
making of any proposal that constitutes an  Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
participate in any discussions or  negotiations regarding an Acquisition
Proposal or (iii)  enter into any agreements, definitive or otherwise, 
regarding an Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that,  at any time
prior to the approval of this Agreement by the  shareholders of the Company,
if the Company receives an  Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited or that
did not  otherwise result from a breach of this Section 7.5(a), the  Company
may furnish non-public information with respect to  the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries to the person who  made such Acquisition Proposal and
may participate in  discussions and negotiations regarding such Acquisition 
Proposal if the Company Board determines (A) based on the  advice of legal
counsel, that the failure to do so would be  reasonably likely to be
inconsistent with its fiduciary  duties to the Company\'s shareholders under
applicable law,  and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal is reasonably
likely  to lead to a Superior Acquisition Proposal (as defined  below).  
(b) At any time prior to the approval of this  Agreement by the shareholders
of the Company, the Company  Board shall not (i) withdraw or modify in a
manner adverse  to MergerCo its approval or recommendation of this
Agreement  or the Merger, (ii) approve or recommend an Acquisition  Proposal
to its shareholders or (iii) cause the Company to  enter into any agreement
with respect to an Acquisition  Proposal, unless in any such case the Company
Board shall  have determined in good faith, based on the advice of legal 
counsel, that failure to do so would be inconsistent with  its fiduciary
duties to the Company\'s shareholders under  applicable law and, in the case
of clause (iii) above, the  Company shall have complied with the provisions
of Section  9.1(c)(i) hereof.   (c) As used in this Agreement, the term
"Acquisition  Proposal" shall mean any proposed or actual (i) merger, 
consolidation or similar transaction involving the Company,  (ii) sale, lease
or other disposition, directly or  indirectly, by merger, consolidation,
share exchange or  otherwise, of any assets of the Company or the Company 
Subsidiaries representing 25% or more of the consolidated  assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (iii)  issue, sale or other disposition
by the Company of  (including by way of merger, consolidation, share
exchange  or any similar transaction) securities (or options, rights  or
warrants to purchase, or securities convertible into,  such securities)
representing 25% or more of the votes  associated with the outstanding
securities of the Company,  (iv) tender or exchange offer in which (A) any
person shall  acquire beneficial ownership (as such term is defined in  Rule
13d-3 under the Exchange Act) or the right to acquire  beneficial ownership
of or (B) any "group" (as such term is  defined under the Exchange Act) shall
have been formed which  beneficially owns, or has the right to acquire
beneficial  ownership of, 25% or more of the outstanding shares of Old 
Common, (v) recapitalization, restructuring, liquidation,  dissolution, or
other similar type of transaction with  respect to the Company, or (vi)
transaction which is similar  in form, substance or purpose to any of the
foregoing  transactions; provided, however, that the term "Acquisition 
Proposal" shall not include the Merger and the Transactions.  The term
"Superior Acquisition Proposal" shall mean an  Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines based  on the advice of its financial advisors is
more favorable to  the shareholders of the Company than the Transactions 
(taking into account all the terms and conditions of such  Acquisition
Proposal and the Transactions, including without  limitation the price, any
conditions to consummation, and  the likelihood of such Superior Acquisition
Proposal and the  Transactions being consummated).   (d) The Company shall
advise MergerCo promptly (but in  any event within 48 hours) in writing of
(i) the receipt of  any inquiry, indication of interest or proposal relating
to  an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) the status of any material  developments
in the negotiations with respect thereto and  (iii) the taking of any action
referred to in Section 7.5(a)  or (b).   (e) Nothing in this Section 7.5
shall (i) permit the  Company to terminate this Agreement other than pursuant
to  Article IX hereof or (ii) affect any other obligation of the  Company
under this Agreement.   7.6 Officers\' and Directors\' Indemnification.  
(a) The Company shall, and from and after the  Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall, indemnify,  defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors,  officers, employees and agents of the Company and of the 
Company Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") against  all losses,
claims, damages, costs, expenses (including  reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses), liabilities,  judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement
with the  approval of the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the  case
may be (the "Indemnifying Party") of, or in connection  with, any threatened
or actual claim, action, suit,  proceeding or investigation based in whole or
in part on, or  arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to, the 
fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the  Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries, whether  pertaining to any matter existing at or
prior to the  Effective Time and whether asserted or claimed prior to, at 
the time of, or after, the Effective Time ("Indemnified  Liabilities"),
including all Indemnified Liabilities based  in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out  of, or pertaining to, this Agreement or the
transactions  contemplated hereby, in each case to the fullest extent a 
corporation is permitted under the IBCL as the same exists  or may hereafter
be amended (but, in the case of any such  amendment, only to the extent that
such amendment permits  broader rights than such law permitted prior to
such  amendment, and only to the extent such amendment is not  retroactively
applicable) to indemnify its own directors or  officers, as the case may be.
Without limiting the  foregoing, in the event any such claim, action, suit, 
proceeding or investigation is brought against any  Indemnified Party
(whether arising before or after the  Effective Time), (i) the Indemnified
Party may retain  counsel satisfactory to it and the Surviving Corporation, 
and the Company or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all  fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Party  promptly as statements therefor
are received and otherwise  advance to such Indemnified Party upon request
for  reimbursement of documented expenses incurred, in either  case to the
fullest extent and in the manner permitted by  the IBCL; and (ii) the Company
or the Surviving Corporation  will use all reasonable efforts to assist in
the vigorous  defense of any such matter, provided that neither the  Company
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for  any settlement effected
without its prior written consent.  Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under  this Section 7.6, upon learning of any such claim,
action,  suit, proceeding or investigation, shall notify the Company  (or,
after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation)  (but the failure so to
notify shall not relieve such  Indemnifying Party from any liability which it
may have  under this Section 7.6 except to the extent such failure 
materially prejudices such Indemnifying Party), and shall to  the extent
required by the IBCL deliver to the Company (or,  after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation) the  undertaking contemplated by Section
23-1-37-10(a) of the  IBCL. The Indemnified Parties as a group may retain
only  one law firm to represent them with respect to each such  matter
unless there is, under applicable standards of  professional conduct, a
conflict on any significant issue  between the positions of any two or more
of the Indemnified  Parties. The Company and MergerCo agree that all rights
to  indemnification, including provisions relating to advances  or expenses
incurred in defense of any action or suit,  existing in favor of the
Indemnified Parties with respect to  matters occurring through the Effective
Time, shall survive  the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect
for a  period of not less than six years from the Effective Time;  provided,
however, that all rights to indemnification in  respect of any Indemnified
Liabilities asserted or made  within such period shall continue until the
disposition of  such Indemnified Liabilities. This Section 7.6 is intended 
for the irrevocable benefit of, and to grant third party  rights to, the
Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on  all successors and assigns of
MergerCo, the Company and the  Surviving Corporation. Each of the Indemnified
Parties  shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this 
Section 7.6.   (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall  purchase
an extended reporting period endorsement  ("Reporting Tail Coverage") under
the Company\'s existing  directors\' and officers\' liability insurance
coverage for  the Company\'s directors and officers in a form acceptable to 
the Company which shall provide such directors and officers  with coverage
for six years following the Effective Time of  not less than the existing
coverage under, and have other  terms not materially less favorable to the
insured persons  than, the directors\' and officers\' liability insurance 
coverage presently maintained by the Company.   7.7 Access to Information;
Confidentiality. From the date hereof until the Effective Time, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries and each of
the Company\'s and Company Subsidiaries\' officers, employees and agents to,
afford to Parent and MergerCo and to the officers, employees and agents of
Parent and MergerCo, respectively, complete access at all reasonable times
and upon reasonable advance notice (which notice shall not be required to be
in writing) to such officers, employees, agents, properties, books, records
and contracts, and shall furnish Parent and MergerCo such financial,
operating and other data and information as Parent and MergerCo may
reasonably request. Parent and MergerCo shall hold in confidence all such
information on the terms and subject to the conditions contained in that
certain agreement between the Company and Parent dated October 6, 2000 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"). MergerCo hereby agrees to be bound by the terms
and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement with the same force and
effect as if it had executed the Confidentiality Agreement as Parent, and the
Company is an intended third party beneficiary of the obligations of MergerCo
arising thereunder. At the Effective Time, the Confidentiality Agreement
shall terminate.   7.8 Public Announcements. The Company and MergerCo shall
consult with each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making
any public statement with respect to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions and shall not issue any such press release or make any such
public statement without the prior consent of the other party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that a party
may, without the prior consent of the other party, issue such press release
or make such public statement as may be required by law if it has (i) used
its reasonable best efforts to consult with the other party and to obtain
such party\'s consent but has been unable to do so in a timely manner and
(ii) faxed a copy of such press release or public statement to such other
party at a reasonable time prior to issuing such release or making
such statement. In this regard, the parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the Merger will be in a form agreed to
by the parties hereto prior to the execution of this Agreement.   7.9
Notification of Certain Matters. Each party shall give prompt written notice
to the other of the receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Transactions.   7.10 Post-Merger
Operations. Following the Effective Time:   (a) Parent shall establish and
maintain for three  years following the Effective Time an Advisory Board,
which  shall be principally concerned with transition and  operational
integration issues arising as a result of the  Merger, which shall meet upon
the call of the chairman of  Parent, and which shall consist of Douglas W.
Huemme, Martha  D. Lamkin, G. Benjamin Lance, Jr., Joseph D. Barnette, Jr., 
Thomas H. Sams, James D. Price, Sarah W. Rowland, David M.  Kirr, and John T.
Hackett, each of whom shall serve for  three years after the Effective Time
and be paid by Parent a  fee of $5,000 per year, and Norma J. Oman and Ramon
L.  Humke, each of whom shall serve for three years after the  Effective
Time;   (b) Parent agrees that the 11 (eleven) Termination  Benefits
Agreements currently in force between the Company  or the Company
Subsidiaries and certain executives of the  Company or the Company
Subsidiaries (each, a "Termination  Benefit Agreement") shall continue in
full force and effect,  except that, with respect to any Termination
Benefit  Agreement, the termination benefit provided therein shall be  paid
to the executive who is a party to such Termination  Benefit Agreement if
such executive\'s employment with the  employer named in such Termination
Benefit Agreement is  terminated (i) for any reason (other than retirement, 
disability, or death) during the two-year period beginning  on the Effective
Time and continuing through and including  the second anniversary thereof, or
(ii) for Good Reason (as  defined below) during the one-year period beginning
on the  day after the second anniversary of the Effective Time and 
continuing through and including the third anniversary of  the Effective
Time.   (c) The Meridian name shall continue to be used by the  Surviving
Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries with  respect to operations within
the State of Indiana in a  manner which is consistent with the manner in
which such  name has been used by the Company and the Company  Subsidiaries
with respect to operations within the State of  Indiana prior to the date
hereof, and, with respect to  operations outside the State of Indiana (and
particularly in  states in which both the Company and the Company 
Subsidiaries on one hand, and Parent and its Affiliates on  the other hand,
have a solid presence), the Parties will  consider use of the Meridian name
on a case-by-case basis  taking into account commercially reasonable
factors;   (d) The Company office building in Indianapolis will  become a
regional office for Parent and its Affiliates,  handling not only the
existing books of business of the  Company Subsidiaries but also the business
of Parent and its  Affiliates in Indiana and Illinois after consummation of
the  transactions contemplated by the Mutual Company Agreement,  and the
Parties will jointly develop a business plan with  respect to operations in
states in which both the Company  and the Company Subsidiaries on one hand,
and Parent and its  Affiliates on the other hand, have a solid presence;  
(e) Parent shall not terminate, nor shall Parent  permit or cause any of its
Affiliates to terminate, as a  result of the Merger or the Transactions, the
employment of  any person who, as of the Effective Time, is an employee of 
the Company or any Company Subsidiary (a "Current Company  Employee");  
(f) Current Company Employees shall be offered  employee benefits as follows:
(i) to the extent that, in  the ordinary course of business consistent with
past  practices, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as of  the
Effective Time, are providing Current Company Employees  with an employee
benefits package (the "Current Company  Benefits Package") which, in the
reasonable discretion of  Parent, is broader than, or otherwise provides
benefits  which are better than, the employee benefits package offered  by
Parent and its Affiliates to their similarly situated  employees, such
broader or better employee benefits package  will continue to be made
available to Current Company  Employees through December 31, 2002, and (ii)
thereafter,  Current Company Employees shall be offered an employee 
benefits package which is, in the aggregate, substantially  equivalent to the
Current Company Benefits Package; and   (g) Over a commercially reasonable
period of time, to  the extent commercially reasonable, investments, data 
processing, and similar "back office" activities of the  Company and the
Company Subsidiaries will be consolidated  with the similar activities and
operations of Parent and its  Affiliates in Parent\'s Columbus, Ohio office;
provided that:   (i) if any such consolidation would result in (A)  with
the consent of a Current Company Employee, such  Current Company Employee\'s
transfer from the Surviving  Corporation\'s Indianapolis, Indiana office to
Parent\'s  Columbus, Ohio office, and such Current Company  Employee does
not consent to such transfer, or (B) the  elimination of such Current Company
Employee\'s job in  the Surviving Corporation\'s Indianapolis, Indiana 
office, then Parent shall have the right to require  such Current Company
Employee to accept a different job  in the Surviving Corporation\'s
Indianapolis, Indiana  office; and   (ii) if such different job would have
a lower base  annual compensation than the Current Company Employee\'s  base
annual compensation immediately prior to the job  change, then (A) for a
period of two years from the  date such Current Company Employee begins
such  different job, such Current Company Employee\'s base  annual
compensation shall be at least as much as the  base annual compensation of
the job held by such  Current Company Employee immediately prior to
beginning  such different job, and (B) after such two-year period,  such
Current Company Employee\'s base annual  compensation shall be at the top of
the range for the  classification of Surviving Corporation jobs within 
which such different job falls.   (h) Parent shall maintain a comparable
level of  involvement in the Indianapolis community as has been  maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the  Effective Time, including
without limitation providing  comparable financial and volunteer support.  
7.11 Meridian Citizens Mutual Insurance Company. The Company shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions necessary to cause the directors of Meridian
Citizens Mutual Insurance Company, a Minnesota mutual insurance company and
an affiliate of the Company ("Meridian Minnesota"), immediately prior to
the Effective Time to be replaced, as of the Effective Time, with those
persons designated by State Auto.    ARTICLE VIII CONDITIONS TO THE
MERGER   8.1 Conditions to the Obligations of Each Party to Effect the
Merger. The respective obligations of each party to effect the Merger shall
be subject to the fulfillment or waiver, where permissible, at or prior to
the Closing Date, of each of the following conditions:   (a) Shareholder

have been approved  and adopted by the affirmative vote of the shareholders
of  the Company to the extent required by the IBCL and the  Articles of

registration with) any Governmental Entity required to be  made or obtained
by the Company or any of the Company  Subsidiaries or MergerCo, as the case
may be, or their  respective affiliates, in connection with the execution, 
delivery and performance of the Agreement shall have been  obtained or made,
except where the failure to have obtained  or made any such consent,
authorization, order, approval,  filing or registration would not,
individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material  Adverse Effect or a MergerCo Material Adverse Effect, as the  case
may be, or would not, individually or in the aggregate,  materially impair or
significantly delay the ability of the  Company and MergerCo to consummate
the Merger.   (d) Other Consents. All consents and approvals by  third
parties (other than Governmental Entities) (i) that  are identified as
conditions to closing in Section 8.1(d) of  the Company Disclosure Schedule,
and (ii) that are required  in order to prevent a breach of, a default under,
or a  termination, change in the terms or conditions or  modification of,
any instrument, contract, lease, license or  other agreement, where such
breach, default, termination or  change would, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably  be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
will  have been obtained on terms and conditions reasonably  satisfactory to
MergerCo.   (e) No Injunctions, Orders or Restraints; Illegality.  No
preliminary or permanent injunction or other order,  decree or ruling issued
by a court of competent jurisdiction  or by a Governmental Entity (an
"Injunction"), nor any  statute, rule, regulation or executive order
promulgated or  enacted by any Governmental Entity, shall be in effect
which  would (i) make the consummation of the Merger illegal, or  (ii)
otherwise prevent or prohibit the consummation of any  of the Transactions,
including the Merger; provided,  however, that prior to invoking this
condition, each party  shall use its reasonable best efforts to have any
such  Injunction vacated.   (f) Merger of Mutuals. All of the conditions 
precedent to the merger of Meridian Mutual and Parent shall  have been
satisfied or waived and Meridian Mutual and Parent  shall be prepared to
consummate such merger. The Parties  intend that the merger of Meridian
Mutual and Parent shall  be consummated immediately prior to the Effective
Time.   8.2 Conditions to Obligations of MergerCo and Parent. The
obligations of MergerCo and Parent to effect the Merger are further subject
to the following conditions:   (a) Representations and Warranties. Those 
representations and warranties of the Company set forth in  this Agreement
which are qualified by materiality or a  Company Material Adverse Effect or
words of similar effect  shall be true and correct as of the Closing Date as
though  made on and as of the Closing Date (except as contemplated  by this
Agreement and except to the extent such  representations and warranties
expressly relate to a  specific date, in which case such representations
and  warranties shall be true and correct as of such date), and  those
representations and warranties of the Company set  forth in this Agreement
which are not so qualified shall be  true and correct in all material
respects as of the Closing  Date as though made on and as of the Closing Date
(except as  contemplated by this Agreement and except to the extent such 
representations and warranties expressly relate to a  specific date, in which
case such representations and  warranties shall be true and correct in all
material  respects as of such date).   (b) Performance and Obligations of
the Company. The  Company shall have performed all obligations required to
be  performed by it under this Agreement, including without  limitation the
covenants contained in Articles 6 and 7  hereof, in all material
respects.   (c) Material Adverse Change. There shall not have  occurred any
change or changes concerning the Company and  the Company Subsidiaries taken
as a whole which would,  individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to  have a Company Material Adverse Effect.   (d) Opinions. Parent
and MergerCo shall have received  a legal opinion from Ice Miller and a tax
opinion from Ernst  and Young LLP, each in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent  and containing terms and conditions which are customary for 
transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement.   Notwithstanding
any language to the contrary in this  Agreement, none of the initiation,
threat or existence of  any legal action of any kind with respect to this
Agreement  or the Transactions, including the Merger, including without 
limitation any action initiated, threatened, or maintained  by any
shareholder of the Company, whether alleging claims  under any Securities
Laws or state securities laws, contract  or tort claims, claims for breach of
fiduciary duty, or  otherwise, will constitute a failure of the conditions
set  forth in Section 8.1, Section 8.2, or Section 8.3 of this  Agreement
unless that action has resulted in the granting of  an Injunction that
prevents the consummation of the Merger  or otherwise prevents or prohibits
the consummation of any  of the Transactions, and such Injunction has not
been  dissolved or vacated.   8.3 Conditions to Obligations of the Company.
The obligation of the Company to effect the Merger is further subject to the
following conditions:   (a) Representations and Warranties. Those

Company an amount  in cash equal to $25,000,000 (the "Company Liquidated 
Damages").   (f) If the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant  to
Section 9.1(c)(ii), but the breach by MergerCo or Parent  was not willful,
then Parent shall pay to the Company an  amount in cash equal to the Company
Expenses. For purposes  of this Agreement, the "Company Expenses" shall mean
an  amount equal to the Company\'s out-of-pocket costs and  expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the  Transactions, including
without limitation fees and  disbursements of its outside legal counsel,
accountants and  other consultants retained by or on behalf of the Company

provided that the exchange of  membership interests pursuant to the Merger
(as defined in  the Mutual Company Agreement) was fair from a financial 
point of view to the policyholders of Meridian Mutual, taken  as a group, as
of that time, then the Company shall pay to  MergerCo an amount in cash equal
to the MergerCo Liquidated  Damages. In addition, if within 12 months
following any  such termination of this Agreement as described in the first 
sentence of this Section 9.2(g), the Company or any Company  Subsidiary
accepts a written offer for or otherwise enters  into an Acquisition Proposal
(other than with Parent or any  Affiliate of Parent), then, upon consummation
of such  Acquisition Proposal, the Company shall pay to MergerCo an 
additional amount in cash equal to the Break-Up Fee minus  the MergerCo
Liquidated Damages previously paid pursuant to  this subsection.   (h) If
(i) either MergerCo or the Company terminates  this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(b)(iv), and (ii) the  Mutual Company Agreement was terminated by
Parent pursuant  to Section 8.1(h)(ii) thereof, then Parent shall pay to
the  Company an amount in cash equal to the Company Liquidated  Damages.  
(i) Except as provided in Section 9.1(c)(i) hereof,  any payment required by
this Section 9.2 shall be due and  payable within five business days after
the date of  termination by wire transfer of immediately available funds  to
an account designated by the payee. In the event that  either the Company
fails to pay the Break-Up Fee (if  payable), the MergerCo Liquidated Damages
(if payable), or  the MergerCo Expenses (if payable) when due or Parent
fails  to pay the Company Liquidated Damages (if payable) or the  Company
Expenses (if payable) when due, the terms "Break-Up  Fee" or "MergerCo
Liquidated Damages" or "Company Liquidated  Damages" or "MergerCo Expenses"
or "Company Expenses," as  applicable, shall be deemed to include (i)

Prime Rate, and (ii) any  and all costs and expenses (including without
limitation,  attorneys\' fees and disbursements) incurred by MergerCo or 
the Company, as applicable, in enforcing its rights under  this Section
9.2(i). The payments made by the Company to  MergerCo, or by Parent to the
Company, as set forth in  Section 9.2 shall represent the sole and exclusive
remedy at  law or in equity to which MergerCo or the Company, as 
applicable, and their respective officers, directors,  representatives and
affiliates shall be entitled in the  event this Agreement is terminated. Such
payments shall be  made without duplication, and, accordingly, neither
MergerCo  nor the Company shall be entitled to payments under Section  9.2
in more than one instance.    ARTICLE X  GENERAL PROVISIONS   10.1

waived by each of the parties.   10.5 Assignment. Except as expressly
permitted by the terms hereof, neither this Agreement nor any of the

Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof
to any person or circumstance, is held invalid or unenforceable, the

persons or circumstances, shall not be affected thereby, and to such
end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to be severable.   10.7
Choice of Law/Consent to Jurisdiction. All disputes, claims or controversies
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, validity or
performance of this Agreement or the Transactions shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Ohio without

irrevocably and unconditionally consents to submit to the sole and exclusive

States located in the States of Ohio or Indiana (the "Agreed Courts") for
any litigation arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or
the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the Transactions (and agrees not to commence any litigation relating thereto
except in such courts), waives any objection to the laying of venue of any
such litigation in the Agreed Courts and agrees not to plead or claim in any
Agreed Court that such litigation brought therein has been brought in any
inconvenient forum. Each of the parties hereto agrees, (a) to the extent
such party is not otherwise subject to service of process in the States of
Ohio or Indiana, to appoint and maintain an agent in the State of Ohio or
Indiana, as applicable, as such party\'s agent for acceptance of legal
