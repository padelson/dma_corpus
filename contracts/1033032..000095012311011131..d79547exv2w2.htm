EXECUTION VERSION 

   

LIMITED GUARANTEE 

   

 This LIMITED GUARANTEE, dated as of February 3, 2011 (this " _Limited Guarantee_ "), by Cerberus Series Four Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Guarantor_ "), in favor of Silverleaf Resorts, Inc., a Texas corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

RECITALS 

   

 WHEREAS, reference is hereby made to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among SL Resort Holdings Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), Resort Merger Sub Inc., a Texas corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and the Company, pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree as follows: 

  

 1. _Limited Guarantee_. 

  

 (a) To induce the Company to enter into the Merger Agreement, the Guarantor, intending to be legally bound, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally, guarantees to the Company, up to the Maximum Amount, the due and punctual payment and performance obligations of Parent and Merger Sub and the Merger Agreement (the " _Obligations_ "); _provided_ _that_ , notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, it is explicitly acknowledged and agreed that (A) in the event that all conditions in Sections 6.1 and 6.3 of the Merger Agreement (other than those not satisfied primarily due to the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to have performed their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement) have been satisfied (or with respect to certificates to be delivered at the Closing, are capable of being satisfied upon the Closing) or waived (to the extent waivable by Parent) at the time when the Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded or the failure of any conditions in Section 6.2 of the Merger Agreement to have been satisfied, then upon the funding of the Equity Financing, the Guarantors guarantee of the Obligations will be deemed satisfied; and (B) if the Company exercises its right to terminate the Merger Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(i) of the Merger Agreement and receive the Parent Termination Fee, then, upon the payment of the Parent Termination Fee to the Company, the Guarantors guarantee of the Obligations will be deemed to be satisfied (the relevant Obligations, as qualified by the limitations set forth in clauses (A) and (B) of this provision, the " _Applicable Obligations_ "). The parties understand and agree that the maximum aggregate liability of the Guarantor in respect of any and all Obligations hereunder shall not exceed $113,800,000 (the " _Maximum Amount_ "), and the Company agrees that this Limited Guarantee may not be enforced without giving effect to the Maximum Amount. All payments hereunder shall be made in lawful money of the United States, in immediately available funds. This Limited Guarantee is an unconditional guarantee of payment and not of collectibility and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that the 

   ##### 

  

 

Company first attempt to collect any amounts in respect of the Obligations
from Parent or Merger Sub or resort to any security or other means of
collecting payments. The Guarantor promises and undertakes to make all
payments hereunder free and clear of any deduction, offset, defense, claim or
counterclaim of any kind (other than defenses to the payment of the
Obligations that are available to Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger
Agreement), except as provided in Section 1(b) below. If Parent or Merger Sub
is in breach of its Obligations, then the Company may at any time and from
time to time, at the Companys option, take any and all actions available
under the Merger Agreement (subject to the limitations set forth in the
Merger Agreement) or under applicable Law to enforce its rights thereunder
and to enforce its rights under this Limited Guarantee. Subject to and in
furtherance of the foregoing, the Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that the
Company may, in its sole discretion, bring and prosecute a separate action or
actions against the Guarantor to enforce its rights under this Limited
Guarantee. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Limited Guarantee, the Company hereby agrees that to the extent Parent and Merger Sub are relieved of all or any portion of the Obligations by the satisfaction thereof or pursuant to any written agreement with the Company entered into prior to the Closing (any amount so relieved, the " _Reduction Amount_ "), the Maximum Amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Reduction Amount. 

  

 2. _Changes In Obligations, Certain Waivers_. 

  

 (a) The Guarantor agrees that the Applicable Obligations of the Guarantor shall not be released or discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the failure or delay on the part of the Company to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Parent or Merger Sub, subject to the second sentence of Section 7 hereof; (ii) the validity or enforceability of the Merger Agreement, but only to the extent resulting from any lack of corporate power or authority of Parent or Merger Sub; (iii) any change in the time, place or manner of payment of any of the Applicable Obligations or any rescission, waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of the terms or provisions of the Merger Agreement made in accordance with the terms thereof or any agreement evidencing, securing or otherwise executed in connection with any of the Applicable Obligations; (iv) the addition, substitution, discharge or release of any entity or other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (v) any change in the corporate existence, structure or ownership of Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (vi) any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; (vii) except as otherwise provided herein, the existence of any claim, set-off or other right that the Guarantor may have at any time against Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, whether in connection with the Applicable Obligations or otherwise; or (viii) the adequacy of any other means the Company may have of obtaining the payment of the Applicable Obligations. The Guarantor waives promptness, diligence, notice of the acceptance of this Limited Guarantee and of the Applicable Obligations, presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any kind (other than notices expressly required to be provided to the Guarantor hereunder or to Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to the Merger 

   ##### 

  

 

Agreement), all defenses which may be available by virtue of any valuation,
stay, moratorium Law or other similar Law now or hereafter in effect, any
right to require the marshalling of assets of Parent or Merger Sub or any
other Person interested in the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement, and all suretyship defenses generally, other than defenses that are
available to Parent and Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement or to the
Guarantor in respect of a breach by the Company of this Limited Guarantee or
based upon fraud or willful misconduct by the Company or any of its
Affiliates. The Guarantor acknowledges that it will receive substantial direct
and indirect benefits from the transactions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and that the waivers set forth in this Limited Guarantee are
knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits. 

   

 (b) The Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its respective Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby or otherwise relating thereto (including under or in respect of the Equity Commitment Letter) against (i) any of the former, current and future equity holders, controlling persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, Affiliates, members, managers, general or limited partners or assignees of the Guarantor, or (ii) any former, current or future stockholder, controlling person, director, officer, employee, general or limited partner, member, manager, Affiliate, agent or assignee of any of the foregoing (those persons and entities described in any of the foregoing clauses, and any of their respective successors or assigns, each being referred to as a " _Non-Recourse Party_ "), except (x) for claims against the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee or under the Equity Commitment Letter issued by Guarantor, or against Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement or (y) in the event that the Guarantor (I) consolidates with or merges with any other Person (an " _Acquiring Person_ ") and is not the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (II) sells, transfers, conveys or otherwise disposes of, including, without limitation, by the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Guarantor, all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any Person (also an " _Acquiring Person_ ") such that the sum of the Guarantors remaining net assets plus uncalled capital is less than the Maximum Amount, then, in each case, the Company may seek recourse from such Acquiring Person but only to the extent of the unpaid liability of the Guarantor hereunder. As used herein, unless otherwise specified herein, the term "Guarantor" shall be deemed to include any such Acquiring Person. The Guarantor hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding asserting that this Limited Guarantee or any portion thereof is illegal, invalid or unenforceable in accordance with its terms. 

  

 3. _No Waiver; Cumulative Rights_. No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise by the Company of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or future exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder. Each and every right, remedy and power hereby granted to the Company or allowed it by Law or other agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other, and may be exercised by the Company at any time or from time to time. The Company shall not have any obligation to proceed at any time or in any manner against, or exhaust any or all of the Companys rights against Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person liable for any Applicable Obligations prior to proceeding against the Guarantor hereunder, and the failure by the Company to pursue rights or remedies against Parent or Merger Sub shall not relieve the Guarantor of any liability hereunder, 

   ##### 

  

 

and shall not impair or affect the rights and remedies, whether express,
implied or available as a matter of law, of the Company. Nothing in this
Limited Guarantee shall affect or be construed to affect any liability of
Parent or Merger Sub to the Company. 

   

 4. _Representations And Warranties_. The Guarantor hereby represents and warrants that: 

  

 (a) the Guarantor has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver this Limited Guarantee and to perform its obligations hereunder and the execution, delivery and performance of this Limited Guarantee (i) have been duly authorized and approved by all necessary action on the part of the Guarantor and (ii) do not and will not (A) result in any breach or violation of, or default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, require consent under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancellation, modification or acceleration of any obligation or the loss of any benefit under any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease, agreement, contract, permit, franchise, right or license binding on the Guarantor or any of its subsidiaries or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of its or their properties, assets or rights or (B) conflict with or result in any violation of the Guarantors charter, partnership agreement, operating agreement or similar organizational documents or any Law, regulation, rule, decree, order or, judgment binding on the Guarantor or any of its properties or assets;

 8. _No Recourse_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, by its acceptance of the benefits of this Limited Guarantee, the Company acknowledges and agrees that no Person other than the Guarantor has any obligations hereunder and that no recourse shall be had hereunder, or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation, against, and no personal liability shall attach to, the Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party, whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of the Company against the Guarantor or any Non-Recourse Party, by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except for the Companys rights against the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee, for the Parents, Merger Subs or the Companys rights under the Equity Commitment Letter, and for the Companys rights against Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement. Recourse against the Guarantor pursuant to and expressly subject to the terms and conditions of this Limited Guarantee and the Equity Commitment Letter, 

   ##### 

  

 

and against Parent or Merger Sub under the Merger Agreement and the Equity
Commitment Letter, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Company

obligations arising under, or in connection with, the Merger Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. 

   

 9. _No Subrogation_.

If any amount shall be paid to the Guarantor in violation of the immediately preceding sentence at any time prior to the satisfaction in full of the Applicable Obligations and any other amounts that may be payable under Section 12 of this Limited Guarantee, such amount shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of the Company, shall be segregated from other property and funds of the Guarantor and shall forthwith be paid or delivered to the Company in the same form as so received (with any necessary endorsement or assignment) to be credited and applied to the Obligations and any other amounts that may be payable under this Limited Guarantee, in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement and herewith, whether matured or unmatured, or to be held as collateral for the Applicable Obligations or other amounts payable under this Limited Guarantee thereafter arising.

UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS LIMITED GUARANTEE, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS LIMITED
GUARANTEE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE,

 11. _Counterparts_. This Limited Guarantee may be executed by facsimile or electronic transmission and in one or more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

  

 12. _Expenses_. The Guarantor agrees to pay, and the Company, by its acceptance of this Limited Guarantee, agrees to pay, all reasonable out of pocket expenses (including reasonable fees of counsel) incurred by the other party in connection with any litigation with respect to this Limited Guarantee if such other party prevails in such litigation. 

  

 13. _Miscellaneous_. 

  

 (a) This Limited Guarantee, the Equity Commitment Letter, the Merger Agreement (including, without limitation, all schedules, annexes and exhibits thereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement represent all agreements between the parties relative to the subject matter hereof. No modification or waiver of any provision hereof shall be enforceable unless agreed to by the Company and the Guarantor in writing. 

  

 (b) The provisions of this Limited Guarantee shall be deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of this Limited Guarantee, or the application thereof to any Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (i) a suitable and equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable provision and (ii) the remainder of this Limited Guarantee and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) When a reference is made in this Limited Guarantee to a Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Limited Guarantee unless otherwise indicated. The descriptive headings herein are inserted for convenience of reference only and are not intended to be part of or to affect the meaning or interpretation of this Limited Guarantee. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Limited Guarantee, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The use of the word "or" is not intended to be exclusive unless expressly indicated otherwise. The phrases "herein," "hereof," "hereunder" and words of similar import shall be deemed to refer to this Limited Guarantee as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Limited Guarantee. 

  

 (d) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this Limited Guarantee. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Limited Guarantee shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Limited Guarantee. 

  

 (e) Each party acknowledges and agrees that (i) this Limited Guarantee is not intended to, and does not, create any agency, partnership, fiduciary or joint venture relationship between or among any of the parties hereto and neither this Limited Guarantee nor any other document or agreement entered into by any party hereto relating to the subject matter hereof shall be construed to suggest otherwise, and (ii) the obligations of the Guarantor under this Limited Guarantee are solely contractual in nature. 

   ##### 

  

  

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have caused this Limited Guarantee to be executed and delivered as of the date first written above by its officer thereunto duly authorized.
