WHOLE; ALLOCATIONS   Section 3.1. Purchase Price. Subject to the
indemnification obligations under Section 10.1, the aggregate amount to be
paid by the Buyer for the Assets and the covenants contained in Section 7.10
is Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) (the "Purchase Price") payable in
either Buyer Common Stock or cash as set forth in Section 3.2. In addition to
the foregoing payment, as consideration for the grant, sale, assignment,
transfer and delivery of the Assets, the Buyer shall assume and discharge the
Assumed Liabilities.   Section 3.2. Payment of Purchase Price. On the
Closing Date, the Buyer shall deliver to the Company the Purchase Price
payable, at the option of the Buyer in its sole discretion, in (i)
immediately available United States funds or (ii) shares of Buyer Common
Stock valued at the Conversion Price. In the event the Buyer determines to
pay the Purchase Price in immediately available funds, such United States
funds may be wired to such bank account(s) as shall be designated in writing
by Caterpillar at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date.    11    Section 3.3. Make Whole. In the event the Buyer
determines to pay the Purchase Price in shares of Buyer Common Stock valued
at the Conversion Price (the "Shares") and:   (a) in compliance with
Section 7.13, the Company sells  any of the Shares within ninety (90) days of
the initial date of  effectiveness of the Registration Statement (provided
that if it does  not remain continuously effective throughout such ninety
(90) day  period, such ninety (90) day period shall be extended by the number
of  days on which the Registration Statement is not effective) (the "Make 
Whole Period") at a price per Share of less than the Base Price, the  Buyer
shall pay to the Company the difference between the price per  Share at which
the Shares were sold and the Base Price; and   (b) if the Company sells any
of the Shares within the  Make Whole Period at a price per Share of greater
than the Cap Price,  the Company shall pay to the Buyer the difference
between the price per  Share at which the Shares were sold and the Cap
Price.  To the extent that any Shares remain unsold following the Make Whole
Period and the average closing price of Buyer Common Stock on the New York
Stock Exchange (or the principal national exchange on which such Common Stock
is then listed) for the five (5) trading days ending on the last day of the
Make Whole Period is greater than the Cap Price, the Company shall pay to the
Buyer the difference between such average and the Cap Price multiplied by the
number of unsold shares.   Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section
3.3 shall be made one time and as promptly as practicable after (i) the
expiration of the ninety (90) day period referenced above and (ii) receipt of
a notice regarding any monies owed. Any payment to be made by any Party
pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall be made in immediately available United
States funds.   Section 3.4. Allocation of Purchase Price. The Parties agree
that within ninety (90) days of the Closing Date they will agree to an
allocation of the Purchase Price to the Assets in accordance with the rules
under Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder (such allocation to be modified in accordance with such rules to
take into account any adjustment to the Purchase Price described in Section
3.3). The Parties agree to file all Tax returns on the basis of such
allocation.   Section 3.5. Allocation of Certain Items. With respect to
certain expenses incurred in the operation of the Business, the following
allocations will be made between the Parties:   (a) Taxes. Real and ad
valorem property taxes will be  apportioned at the Closing based upon current
tax bills if available;  and if not available, such apportionment will be
based on the most  recent tax bills available, with appropriate subsequent
adjustment when  bills for 2001 are received.   (b) Utilities. Utilities,
water and sewer charges will be  apportioned based upon the number of
operating days occurring before  and after the Closing Date during the
billing period for each such  charge.   (c) Workers\' Compensation.
Pursuant to the provisions of  this Agreement, the Company will be
responsible for and pay any and all  workers\' compensation and   
12    other similar claims asserted by or with respect to any employee or 
former employee of the Company in respect of any injury or other  compensable
event or occupational illness or disease which occurred or  is attributable
to any event, state of facts or condition which existed  or occurred in whole
prior to or on the Closing Date. The Buyer is  responsible for and will pay
any and all workers\' compensation and  other similar claims asserted by or
with respect to any employee of the  Buyer in respect of any injury or other
compensable event or  occupational illness or disease which occurred or is
attributable to  any event, state of facts or condition which existed or
occurred in  whole after the Closing Date. If any such injury or other
compensable  event or occupational illness or disease of a person who was
employed  both by the Company prior to or on the Closing Date and by the
Buyer  after the Closing Date is attributable in part to causes occurring 
prior to or on the Closing Date and in part to causes occurring  subsequent
to the Closing Date and is the basis of a workers\'  compensation or other
similar claim asserted after the date hereof,  then liability for any such
claim will be shared by the Company and the  Buyer in the proportion of the
periods of employment of the employee  (i) by the Company prior to or on the
Closing Date and (ii) by the  Buyer after the Closing Date, respectively.  
(d) Method of Payment. Appropriate cash payments by the  Buyer or the
Company, as the case may require, shall be made hereunder  from time to time
as soon as practicable after the facts giving rise to  the obligation for
such payments are known in the amounts necessary to  give effect to the
allocations provided for in this Section 3.5.   ARTICLE IV  CLOSING   The
Closing will occur within five (5) Business Days following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VIII, or on such other date
as the Parties may agree. The Closing, to the extent practicable, will be
completed by facsimile and otherwise will take place at the offices
of Troutman Sanders LLP, 600 Peachtree Street, Atlanta, Georgia, or at such
other place as the Parties may agree.   ARTICLE V  REPRESENTATIONS AND

Section 5.2. Authority. Each of Caterpillar and the Company has the requisite
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents and to fully perform its respective obligations hereunder and
thereunder, and the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents by each of Caterpillar and the Company and its   
13   respective performance of the transactions contemplated herein and
therein have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate and stockholder
action. This Agreement has been, and each of the Ancillary Documents will be
as of the Closing Date, duly executed and delivered by each of Caterpillar
and the Company and do or will, as the case may be, constitute the valid and
binding agreements of each of Caterpillar and the Company, enforceable
against each of Caterpillar and the Company in accordance with their
respective terms.   Section 5.3. Absence of Restrictions and Conflicts. The
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents and the fulfillment of and compliance
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents
do not or will not (as the case may be), with the passing of time or the
giving of notice or both, violate or conflict with, constitute a breach of or
default under, result in the loss of any benefit under, permit the
acceleration of any obligation under or create in any party the right to
terminate, modify or cancel, (a) any term or provision of the Company\'s
Charter or Bylaws, (b) except as indicated on Schedule 5.17, any Assumed
Contract or any other contract, will, agreement, permit, franchise, license
or other instrument applicable to any of the Assets or the Business, (c) any
judgment, decree or order of any court or governmental authority or agency to
which any of the Assets or the Business or by which any of the Assets or the
Business are bound or (d) any statute, law, rule, regulation or arbitration
award applicable to the Business, except in the case of clause (c) or (d), as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Business and Assets, taken as
a whole. Except for such consents, approvals, orders or authorizations the
failure of which to obtain or make would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, no consent, approval, order or
authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any
Governmental Entity is required with respect to the Company in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents or the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby other than as required by the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act").   Section
5.4. Financial Performance. Attached as Schedule 5.4 is data supplied by the
Company to the Buyer. Such data was derived from the books and records of the
Company and was prepared in good faith.   Section 5.5. Absence of Certain
Changes. As of the date hereof, the Company has not encountered any
difficulties in the design, testing or product development of the MT 700 or

Business or any of the Assets. All Licenses used in connection with the

effect. The Company owns or possesses all of the Licenses which are material
to the operation of the Business as presently conducted. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents and the fulfillment of and compliance with the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents do not or will not
(as the case may be), with the passing of time or the giving of notice or
both, violate or conflict with, constitute a breach of or default   
14   under, any License used in connection with the Business or any of the
Assets. The Company has taken all necessary action to maintain each License
used in connection with the Business or any of the Assets, except where the
failure to so act is not likely to have an adverse effect on any of the
Assets or the Business that cannot be reasonably promptly remedied at
immaterial cost to the Buyer. No loss or expiration of any License used in
connection with the Business or any of the Assets is threatened, pending, or
reasonably foreseeable (other than expiration upon the end of any term) that
cannot be promptly remedied at insignificant cost.   Section 5.7. Legal

product liability and warranty claims of litigation, and workers compensation
claims) in which the amount in controversy does not exceed $10,000 for any
individual matter or $100,000 in the aggregate for any related matters. None
of such suits, actions, claims, proceedings or investigations, if finally
determined adversely, are reasonably likely, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect. The Company is not subject to
any judgment, decree, injunction, rule or order of any court or arbitration
panel related to the Business or any of the Assets.   Section 5.8. Title to

and all regulatory approvals and to satisfy all conditions to their
respective obligations under this Agreement and to cause the transactions
contemplated in this Agreement to be effected as soon as practicable in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and will cooperate fully with
each other and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents,
counsel, accountants and other designees in connection with any steps
required to be taken as a part of their respective obligations under this
Agreement, including, without limitation:   (a) Each of the Buyer and
Caterpillar shall as promptly  as practicable, but in no event later than ten
(10) Business Days  following the date hereof, file with the United States
Federal Trade  Commission and the United States Department of Justice, the 
notification and report form under the HSR Act required for the  transactions
contemplated hereby and any supplemental information  requested in connection
therewith pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of the  Buyer and Caterpillar shall
as promptly as practicable comply with any  other laws of any country which
are applicable to any of the  transactions contemplated hereby and pursuant
to which any consent,  approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration or  filing with, any Governmental Entity or any other Person in
connection  with such transactions is necessary. Each of the Buyer and
Caterpillar  shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable  assistance as the other may request in connection with its
preparation  of any filing, registration or declaration which is necessary
under the  HSR Act or any other such laws. The Buyer and Caterpillar shall
keep  each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any 
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental 
Entity, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request.   (b) In
the event any claim, action, suit, investigation  or other proceeding by any
Governmental Entity or other Person is  commenced which questions the
validity or legality of the Acquisition  or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or  seeks damages in connection therewith, the
Parties agree to cooperate  and use all reasonable efforts to defend against
such claim, action,  suit, investigation or other proceeding and, if an
injunction or other  order is issued in any such action, suit or other
proceeding, to use  all reasonable efforts to have such injunction or other
order lifted  and to cooperate reasonably regarding any other impediment to
the  consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c)
The Company will give any notices to third parties  and use its reasonable
best efforts (in consultation with the Buyer) to  obtain any third party
consents (other than in connection with any  labor organization) (i)
necessary to consummate the transactions   32    contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) disclosed or required to be  disclosed in the Schedules to
this Agreement, including, without  limitation, the consents described in
Schedule 5.17, (iii) required to  avoid a breach of or default under any
Assumed Contracts in connection  with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement or (iv) required to prevent a Material
Adverse Effect,  whether prior to or after the Closing.   Section 7.6.
Consents. The Company shall, during the remaining term of the Non-Assignable
Contracts, use its reasonable best efforts to (a) obtain the consent of the
applicable third party, (b) make the benefit of such Non-Assignable Contracts
available to the Buyer, and (c) enforce, at the request of the Buyer, any
rights of the Company arising from such Non-Assignable Contracts against the
other party or parties thereto (including the right to elect or terminate any
such Non-Assignable Contracts in accordance with the terms thereof). The
Company will not take any action or suffer any omission which would limit or
restrict or terminate in any material respect the benefits to the Buyer of
such Non-Assignable Contracts unless, in good faith and after consultation
with and prior written notice to the Buyer, the Company is ordered orally or
in writing to do so by a Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or the
Company is otherwise required to do so by law, rule, regulation or judicial
or administrative process; provided that if any such order is appealable, the
Company will take such actions as are reasonably requested by the Buyer to
file and pursue such appeal and to obtain a stay of such order. With respect
to any such Non-Assignable Contract as to which the necessary approval or
consent for the assignment or transfer to the Buyer is obtained following the
Closing, the Company shall transfer such Non-Assignable Contract to the Buyer
by execution and delivery of an instrument of conveyance
reasonably satisfactory to the Parties within three (3) Business Days
following receipt of such approval or consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Buyer shall be indemnified to the extent of any losses which result from
(i) the Company\'s failure to take any lawful action in accordance with the
Buyer\'s reasonable instructions or (ii) the Company\'s gross negligence or
willful misconduct.   Section 7.7. Public Announcements. The timing and
content of all announcements regarding any aspect of this Agreement to the
financial community, government agencies, employees or the general public
shall be mutually agreed upon in advance (unless any of the Parties
reasonably determines that any such announcement or other disclosure not
mutually agreed upon in advance is required to be made by law or applicable
rule of the New York Stock Exchange, and then only after consulting with the
other party and making reasonable efforts to comply with the provisions of
this Section).   Section 7.8. Employees.   (a) On the Closing Date, the
Company will terminate the  employment of all of the Hourly Production
Employees in connection with  its cessation of production in connection with
the Business. Prior to  or on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall offer
employment on an at will  basis to all of the Hourly Production Employees
active on the Closing  Date (including those on vacation and short-term
disability) and, as  additional employees are needed, will give preference to
those  individuals who were on leave of absence or layoff on the Closing
Date.  Those Business Employees who accept Buyer\'s    33    offer of
employment and commence working for Buyer shall be referred to  as
"Transferred Production Employees."   (b) It is agreed that prior to, or in
connection with,  the Closing, the Buyer shall take no action to cause the
Company to  terminate the employment of any Administrative Employees (as
defined  below) who shall remain employed by the Company and may be subject
to  the Transition Services Agreement.   (c) The Buyer acknowledges that
the Company is bound by a  collective bargaining agreement with the Union,
which is listed on  Schedule 5.14 (the "Collective Bargaining Agreement").
The Buyer agrees  to recognize the Union as the exclusive representative for
the  bargaining unit covered by the Collective Bargaining Agreement.   (d)
Neither the Buyer nor the Company shall, at any time  prior to ninety (90)
days after the Closing Date, effectuate a "plant  closing" or "mass layoff",
as those terms are defined in WARN,  affecting in whole or in part any site
of employment, facility,  operating unit or employee, without notifying the
Company in advance  and without complying with the notice requirements and
other provisions  of WARN and any similar state or local law, rule or
regulation.   (e) (i) Caterpillar shall, as of the Closing Date,  continue
to employ all salaried, non-union employees who are engaged  exclusively or
primarily in the operations of the Business, as set  forth on Schedule
7.8(e)(i) (the "Administrative Employees"). Between  the date hereof and the
fifth (5th) Business Day prior to the Closing,  the Buyer shall inform the
Company in writing which Administrative  Employees it desires to lease for a
period of up to two (2) years after  the Closing Date. Administrative
Employees who are leased to the Buyer  at any time during such two (2) year
period are referred to herein as  the "Leased Employees." The Buyer shall
reimburse Caterpillar for the  compensation (excluding severance costs) and
benefits (based upon COBRA  rates for the items covered by COBRA) provided to
the Leased Employees,  and shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless
Caterpillar for all  claims (including, but not limited to, workers
compensation and other  related labor claims) that any Leased Employee may
make against  Caterpillar with respect to the services provided to the
Business  following the Closing other than due to Caterpillar\'s or the
Company\'s  bad faith, willful misconduct or violation of law. The full terms
of  the administration, compensation and provision of benefits to the 
Leased Employees, as well as the Buyer\'s reimbursement of the costs  thereof
and of the employee leasing arrangements, shall be set forth  more fully in
the Transition Services Agreement.   (ii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A)
if at any  time during the two-year leasing period the Buyer offers
employment to  any Leased Employee, and such Leased Employee accepts such
offer of  employment, such Leased Employee shall be referred to as a
"Transferred  Employee" for purposes of this Agreement, and (B) from time-to-
time  (but not more often than monthly), on thirty (30) days\' advance
written  notice, the Buyer may terminate the lease with respect to
individual  Leased Employees.    34    (f) COBRA Coverage. Caterpillar
or the Company shall be  solely responsible for offering and providing any
COBRA Coverage with  respect to any Business Employee who is also a
"qualified beneficiary"  who is covered by a Benefit Plan that is a "group
health plan" (as  defined under COBRA) and who experiences a qualifying event
on or prior  to the Closing Date. The Buyer shall be solely responsible for
offering  and providing any COBRA Coverage required with respect to any 
Transferred Employees (or other "qualified beneficiaries") who become 
covered by a group health plan sponsored or contributed to by the Buyer  and
who experience a "qualifying event" after the Closing Date.  "Qualified
beneficiary," "group health plan" and "qualifying event" are  as defined in
Section 4980B of the Code.   (g) Information. The Company shall provide the
Buyer with  all information relating to each Transferred Employee as the
Buyer may  reasonably request in connection with its employment of such
persons,  including, without limitation, initial employment dates,
termination  dates, reemployment dates, hours of service, compensation and
tax  withholding history in a form that will be reasonably usable by the 
Buyer and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause  such
information to be true and correct in all material respects.   (h) 401(k)
Plan. The Company shall take whatever action  it deems reasonably necessary
(and permitted by applicable law) to  cause the Business Employees who are
participants in the Caterpillar  Inc. Tax Deferred Savings Plan to terminate
their active participation  in the 401(k) plan at such time as the Business
Employees become  Transferred Employees, and to cause the 401(k) Plan to
permit a  distribution to such participants of their vested account balances
as  soon as practicable after such time as the Business Employees become 
Transferred Employees (subject to the repayment of any loans from the  401(k)
plan to any such participants to the extent required to be  repaid under the
terms of the 401(k) plan). The Buyer\'s 401(k) plan  shall accept rollover
contributions (excluding any outstanding loans),  attributable to
distributions from Caterpillar\'s 401(k) plan, made by  or on behalf of
Transferred Employees eligible to participate in  Caterpillar\'s 401(k) plan;
provided, however, that Caterpillar or  the Company provides the Buyer with
reasonable evidence of the  qualified status of Caterpillar\'s 401(k)
plan.   (i) Labor Indemnification. The Buyer shall indemnify,  defend and
hold the Company harmless from and against any and all  claims, actions,
suits, back pay demands, charges, proceedings, losses,  expenses, damages,
obligations and liabilities (including costs of  collection, attorney\'s fees
and other costs of defense) arising out of  or otherwise in respect of any
acts or omissions of the Buyer at any  time relating to the employment or
potential employment of any Hourly  Production Employees by the Buyer,
including but not limited to any  claim that the Buyer failed to comply with
any statutory, contractual  or other obligations to the Hourly Production
Employees or their  representatives, or, with respect to any violations of
the ADA, the  fact that any Hourly Production Employee who is employed by the
Company  immediately prior to the Closing is not employed by the Buyer.   
35    Section 7.9. Transfer Taxes; Expenses. All sales and real
estate taxes payable as a result of the Acquisition or any other action
contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the Company. All stamp,
documentary, filing, recording, transfer, gains or similar fees or taxes or
governmental charged (including, without limitation, UCC-3 filing fees and
motor vehicle registration fees, title recording or filing fees and other
amounts payable in respect of transfer filing) payable as a result of the
Acquisition or any other action contemplated by this Agreement (other than
any federal, state, local or foreign taxes measured by the Company based upon
income or gains imposed upon the Buyer) will be shared equally by the
Parties. The Parties will cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing
of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents regarding any
real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock
transfer and stamp taxes, any transfer, recording, registration and other
fees and any similar taxes which become payable in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby that are required or permitted to be filed
on or before the Closing.   Section 7.10. Non-Disclosure;
Noncompetition.   (a) Confidential Information. Each of the Parties agrees 
that it and its Affiliates shall hold in confidence at all times after  the
date hereof all Confidential Information, and shall not disclose,  publish or
make use of Confidential Information at any time after the  date hereof
without the prior written consent of the other Parties.   (b)
Noncompetition.   (i) Each of Caterpillar and the Company hereby 
acknowledges that each of them conducts the Business throughout the 
Territory. Each of Caterpillar and the Company acknowledges that to  protect
adequately the interest of the Buyer, it is essential that any  noncompete
covenant with respect thereto cover the Business throughout  the entire
Territory.   (ii) Each of Caterpillar and the Company hereby  agrees that
neither it, nor any of its Affiliates, shall, during the  Noncompete Period,
in any manner, directly or indirectly engage in the  Business within the
Territory or have an equity or profit interest in  any enterprise that
engages, in whole or in part, in the Business in  the Territory; provided,
however, that Caterpillar and the Company  shall not be in violation of this
Section 7.10(b) as a result of (A)  beneficially owning less than five
percent (5%) of the outstanding  voting securities of a Person, the voting
securities of which are  traded on a national securities exchange, the Nasdaq
National Market  System or an internationally recognized securities exchange
(such as  the London or Tokyo Stock Exchange), (B) engaging in a business 
combination with one or more Persons not primarily engaged in the 
manufacture of agriculture equipment or a business combination with one  or
more Persons in which the aggregate consideration (including assumed  debt)
exceeds $2 billion, (C) subsequent to the fifth anniversary of  the Closing,
engaging in any business combination with one or more  Persons or (D) solely
for purposes of this Section 7.10(b), performing  its obligations under the
JV Agreements. For purposes of this Section  7.10(b)(ii), "business
combination" shall include stock acquisitions,  asset acquisitions, mergers,
consolidations, formations of joint  ventures and similar transactions.   
36    (c) Employee Nonsolicitation. Each of Caterpillar and the  Company
hereby agrees that neither it, nor any of its Affiliates,  shall, prior to
the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date, in  any manner, directly or
indirectly or by assisting others, recruit or  hire away or attempt to
recruit or hire away, on its behalf or on  behalf of any other Person, any
employee of the Company who is hired by  the Buyer in connection with this
Agreement.   (d) Customer Nonsolicitation. Each of Caterpillar and the 
Company hereby agrees that during the Noncompete Period neither it, nor  any
of its Affiliates, shall for its own benefit or the benefit of  others, other
than for the Buyer, solicit a customer of the Business  for the purpose of
supplying such customer goods or services that are  similar to the goods or
services to be provided by the Buyer in  connection with this Agreement.  
(e) Supplier Non-Interference. Each of Caterpillar and  the Company hereby
agrees that neither it, nor any of its Affiliates,  shall, directly or
indirectly or by assisting others, interfere with  the relationship between
the suppliers of the Buyer following the  Closing, except in a manner
consistent with the best interests of the  Buyer.   (f) Severability. If a
judicial or arbitral determination  is made that any of the provisions of
this Section 7.10 constitutes an  unreasonable or otherwise unenforceable
restriction against either  Caterpillar or the Company or any of its
Affiliates (as the case may  be), the provisions of this Section 7.10 shall
be rendered void only to  the extent that such judicial or arbitral
determination finds such  provisions to be unreasonable or otherwise
unenforceable. In this  regard, the Parties hereby agree that any judicial
authority construing  this Agreement shall be empowered to sever any portion
of the  Territory, any prohibited business activity or any time period from
the  coverage of this Section 7.10 and to apply the provisions of this 
Section 7.10 to the remaining portion of the Territory, the remaining 
business activities and the remaining time period not so severed by  such
judicial or arbitral authority. Moreover, notwithstanding the fact  that any
provision of this Section 7.10 is determined not to be  specifically
enforceable, the Buyer shall nevertheless be entitled to  recover monetary
damages as a result of the breach of such provision.  The time period during
which the prohibitions set forth in this Section  7.10 shall apply shall be
tolled and suspended for a period equal to  the aggregate time during which
either Caterpillar or the Company  violates such prohibitions in any
respect.   (g) Injunctive Relief. Each of Caterpillar and the  Company
hereby agrees that any remedy at law for any breach of the  provisions
contained in this Section 7.10 shall be inadequate and that  the Buyer shall
be entitled to injunctive relief in addition to any  other remedy the Buyer
might have under this Agreement in law, in  equity or otherwise.   Section
7.11. Risk of Loss. The risk of loss with respect to the Assets shall remain
with the Company until the Closing. If, before the Closing, any of the Assets
are lost, damaged or destroyed and the loss, damage or destruction has caused
a Material Adverse Effect, then:   (a) the Buyer may terminate this
Agreement in accordance  with the provisions of Section 9.1(d); or   
37    (b) the Buyer may require the Company to assign to the  Buyer the
proceeds of any insurance payable as a result of the  occurrence of such
loss, damage or destruction and to reduce the  Purchase Price by the amount
of the replacement cost of the Assets  which were lost, damaged or destroyed
less the amount of any proceeds  of insurance payable as a result of the
occurrence.   Section 7.12. Resale Registration Statement; Limitations
on Subsequent Transfers of the Shares; Legends.   (a) The Buyer agrees to
file with the SEC, no later than  fifteen (15) days after the Closing Date, a
registration statement (the  "Registration Statement") under the Securities
Act with respect to the  resale or distribution of the Shares by the Company
and/or an  Affiliate. The registration provided by this Section 7.12 shall
be  effected by the filing of a registration statement on Form S-3 or, if 
such form is unavailable, Form S-1 or Form S-4, which shall provide for 
sales to be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the 
Securities Act (or any similar rule that may be adopted by the SEC).  The
Buyer agrees to keep the Registration Statement filed pursuant to  this
Section 7.12 continuously effective and current for a period to  expire upon
the earlier of (i) six (6) months following the initial  date such
Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, or  (ii) the date
that all of the shares covered by the Registration  Statement have been sold
or distributed thereunder. The Buyer also  agrees that it will use reasonable
best efforts to maintain its status  as a company that is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange for so long  as the Company owns the Shares. In
connection with the preparation of  the Registration Statement, the Company
agrees to provide any and all  information regarding the Company and the
resale or distribution of the  Shares required to be included in the
Registration Statement.   (b) The Company agrees that during the Make Whole
Period  it will sell the Shares only in a manner designed to maximize the 
proceeds therefrom consistent with commercially reasonable trade  execution
practices.   (c) The Company agrees that neither it nor any Affiliate  will
sell, distribute or otherwise transfer (or consent to any sale,  distribution
or transfer of), or enter into any agreement or commitment  to undertake any
of the foregoing, any of the Shares other than:   (i) pursuant to the
Registration Statement; or   (ii) in a manner exempt from registration, in 
which event it shall have delivered to the Buyer an opinion of counsel 
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and its counsel that registration is  not
required under the Securities Act or under any applicable  securities laws of
any jurisdiction.   (d) All expenses incident to the Buyer\'s performance
of  or compliance with this Section 7.12, including without limitation all 
registration and filling fees, fees for listing the securities on New  York
Stock Exchange, fees and expenses of compliance with securities or  blue sky
laws, printing expenses, fees and disbursements of custodians    38   
and all independent certified public accountants, and other Persons  retained
by the Buyer, shall, except as otherwise agreed in writing by  the Parties,
be borne by the Buyer. The expenses of the Company,  including the cost of
its legal counsel and brokerage and other  transaction fees, shall be borne
by the Company.   (e) (i) The Buyer agrees to indemnify, to the extent 
permitted by law, each Person selling or distributing securities under  the
Registration Statement, such Person\'s officers, directors,  partners, agents
and Affiliates and each other Person that controls  such Person (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) against all  losses, claims, damages,
liabilities (or actions or proceedings,  whether commenced or threatened, in
respect thereof and whether or not  such Indemnified Party is a party
thereto) and expenses, including  without limitation the reasonable fees,
disbursements and other charges  of legal counsel and reasonable costs of
investigation, to which such  indemnitee may become subject under the
Securities Act or otherwise,  insofar as losses are caused by (x) any untrue
or alleged untrue  statement of material fact contained in the Registration
Statement (or  any prospectus included therein) or any amendment thereof or
supplement  thereto, (y) any omission or alleged omission of a material
fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements 
therein not misleading, or (z) any violation or alleged violation by  the
Buyer of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, except in each case  insofar as
the same are caused by or contained in any information  furnished in writing
to the Buyer by such Person expressly for use  therein or by such Person\'s
failure to deliver a copy of the  Registration Statement (or prospectus
included therein) or any  amendments or supplements thereto after the Buyer
has furnished such  Person with a sufficient number of copies of the
same.   (ii) Each Person (including, without limitation,  the Company) that
is selling or distributing securities under the  Registration Statement shall
furnish to the Buyer in writing such  information concerning such Person and
the distribution of the Shares  as the Buyer reasonably requests for use in
connection with such  Registration Statement and, to the extent permitted by
law, shall  indemnify the Buyer, its directors and officers and each Person
who  controls the Buyer (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against 
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses resulting from  (x) any
untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained  in the
Registration Statement (or any prospectus included therein) or  any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, (y) any omission or  alleged omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or  necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, or (z) any  violation or alleged violation
by the Buyer of the Securities Act or  Exchange Act, but only to the extent
that such untrue statement,  omission or violation is contained in or
directly results from any  information so furnished in writing by such
Person; provided that the  obligation to indemnify shall be individual, not
joint and several, for  each such Person and shall be limited to the net
amount of proceeds  received by such Person from the sale or distribution of
securities  pursuant to such Registration Statement.   (iii) The
indemnification provided for under this  Section 7.12(e) shall remain in full
force and effect regardless of any  investigation made by or on behalf of the
indemnified party or any  officer, director or controlling Person of such
indemnified party and  shall survive the transfer of the Shares. The Buyer
also agrees to make  such    39    provisions, as are reasonably
requested by any indemnified party, for  contribution to such party in the
event the Buyer\'s indemnification is  unavailable for any reason such that
such provisions provide the same  obligations and benefits to the indemnified
party as those which would  have been applicable had the indemnification
provisions set forth above  had been available.   (f) Contribution. If the
indemnification provided for in  Section 7.12(e) shall for any reason be
unavailable to an indemnified  party under subsection (i) or (ii) of Section
7.12(e) in respect of any  Loss, then, in lieu of the amount paid or payable
under subsection (i)  or (ii) of Section 7.12(e), the indemnified party and
the indemnifying  party under subsection (i) or (ii) of Section 7.12(e) shall
contribute  to the aggregate losses (including legal or other expenses
reasonably  incurred in connection with investigating the same) (i) in such 
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the  Company on
the one hand and the Buyer on the other hand which resulted  in such loss or
action in respect thereof, with respect to the  statements, omissions or
action which resulted in such loss or action  in respect thereof, as well as
any other relevant equitable  considerations, or (ii) if the allocation
provided by clause (i) above  is not permitted by applicable law, in such
proportion as shall be  appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company,  on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, from the
sale of the  Shares; provided, that, for purposes of this clause (ii), the
relative  benefits received by the Company shall be deemed not to exceed
the  amount received by the Company. No Person guilty of fraudulent 
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the  Securities
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who  was not guilty of
such fraudulent misrepresentation. In addition, no  Person shall be obligated
to contribute hereunder any amounts in  payment for any settlement of any
action or loss effected without such  Person\'s consent.   (g) The Company
agrees and acknowledges that the  certificates representing the Shares, and
any other securities issued  in respect thereto or any other securities not
registered under the  Securities Act, shall be stamped or otherwise imprinted
with  restrictive legends in customary form. Any such legends shall be 
removed upon the sale of the Shares pursuant to the Registration  Statement
or an exemption from registration under the Securities Act.   (h) Effective
Registration Statement. The Registration  Statement shall not be deemed to be
effective:   (i) unless it has been declared effective by the  SEC and
remains effective in compliance with the provisions of the  Securities Act
and the laws of any state or other jurisdiction  applicable to the
disposition of the Shares covered by the Registration  Statement until such
time as all of such Shares have been disposed of  in accordance with such
Registration Statement.   (ii) if, after it has become effective, such 
Registration Statement is interfered with by any stop order, injunction  or
other order or requirement of the SEC or other Governmental Entity  for any
reason other than a violation of applicable law solely    40    by the
Company and/or an Affiliate of the Company and has not  thereafter become
effective.   (i) Registration Procedures. The Buyer shall, as 
expeditiously as possible:   (i) prepare and file with the SEC such 
amendments and supplements to the Registration Statement and the  prospectus
used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep the  Registration
Statement effective and to comply with the provisions of  the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act with respect to the disposition  of all Shares covered
by the Registration Statement until such time as  all of the Shares have been
disposed of in accordance with the method  of disposition set forth in the
Registration Statement;   (ii) furnish to the Company and/or an Affiliate 
of the Company covered by the Registration Statement such number of  copies
of such drafts and final conformed versions of the Registration  Statement
and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in each  case including
all exhibits and any documents incorporated by  reference), such number of
copies of such drafts and final versions of  the prospectus contained in the
Registration Statement (including each  preliminary prospectus and any
summary prospectus) and any other  prospectus filed under Rule 424 under the
Securities Act, in conformity  with the requirements of the Securities Act,
and such other documents,  as the Company and/or an Affiliate of the Company
may reasonably  request in writing;   (iii) use its reasonable best efforts
(A) to  register or qualify all Shares and other securities covered by the 
Registration Statement under such other securities or blue sky laws of  such
states or other jurisdictions of the United States of America as  the Company
and/or an Affiliate of the Company covered by the  Registration Statement
shall reasonably request in writing, (B) to keep  such registration or
qualification in effect for so long as the  Registration Statement remains in
effect and (C) to take any other  action that may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to enable the  Company and/or an Affiliate of the Company to
consummate the  disposition in such U.S. jurisdictions as the Company and/or
an  Affiliate of the Company shall reasonably request, except that the 
Buyer shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify generally  to do
business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it  would not
but for the requirements of this subsection (iii) be  obligated to be so
qualified, to subject itself to taxation in such  jurisdiction or to consent
to general service of process in any such  jurisdiction;   (iv) notify the
Company upon discovery that, or  upon the happening of any event as a result
of which, the prospectus  included in such Registration Statement, as then in
effect, includes an  untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state
any material fact  required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements  therein not misleading in the light of the circumstances under
which  they were made, and promptly prepare and furnish to the Company a 
reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such 
prospectus as may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to the 
purchasers of the Shares, such prospectus, as supplemented or amended,  shall
not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to  state a
material fact required to    41    be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein not  misleading in the light of the circumstance
under which they were made;  and   (v) enter into such customary agreements
and  take such other actions as the Company shall reasonably request in 
order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Shares.   (j) In
connection with the preparation and filing of the  Registration Statement
under the Securities Act pursuant to this  Agreement, the Buyer shall give
the Company, its counsel and  accountants the reasonable opportunity to
participate in the  preparation of the Registration Statement, each
prospectus included  therein, or filed with the SEC, and each amendment
thereof or  supplement thereto, and shall give each of them reasonable access
to  its books and records and such reasonable opportunities to discuss the 
business of the Buyer with its officers and the independent public 
accountants who have certified its financial statements as shall be 
necessary, in the reasonable opinion of the Company, to conduct a  reasonable
investigation within the meaning of the Securities Act.   Section 7.13.

Termination. This Agreement may be terminated:   (a) in writing by mutual
consent of the Parties;   (b) by written notice from either Caterpillar or
the  Company to the Buyer, if the Buyer (i) fails to perform in any
material  respect any of its agreements contained in this Agreement required
to  be performed by it on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) materially 
breaches any of its representations and warranties contained in this 
Agreement,    46    which failure or breach is not cured within thirty
(30) days after  either Caterpillar or the Company has notified the Buyer in
writing of  such breach or failure;   (c) by written notice from the Buyer
to either  Caterpillar or the Company, if the Company (i) fails to perform in
any  material respect any of its agreements contained in this Agreement 
required to be performed by it on or prior to the Closing Date or (ii) 
materially breaches any of its representations and warranties contained  in
this Agreement, which failure or breach is not cured within thirty  (30) days
after the Buyer has notified either Caterpillar or the  Company of such

under  the circumstances described in Section 7.11; or   (e) by written
notice by the Company to the Buyer or the  Buyer to the Company, as the case
may be, if the Closing has not  occurred on or prior to May 31, 2002 for any
reason other than delay or  nonperformance of the Party seeking such
termination.   Section 9.2. Specific Performance and Other Remedies. The
Parties each acknowledge that the rights of each Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are special, unique and of
extraordinary character and that, in the event that any Party violates or
fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by it in this
Agreement, the non-breaching Party may be without an adequate remedy at law.
The Parties agree, therefore, that in the event that any Party violates or
fails or refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party in
this Agreement, the non-breaching Party or Parties may, subject to the terms
of this Agreement and in addition to any remedies at law for damages or other
relief, institute and prosecute an action in any court of competent
jurisdiction to enforce specific performance of such covenant or agreement or
seek any other equitable relief.   Section 9.3. Effect of Termination. In
the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article IX, this
Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be no liability on the
part of any Party or its respective partners, officers, directors or
stockholders, except for obligations under Section 7.7 (Public
Announcements), Section 11.1 (Notices), Section 11.6 (Controlling Law;
Amendment), Section 11.13 (Transaction and Other Costs), Section 11.14
(Consent to Jurisdiction, Etc.) and this Section 9.3, all of which will
survive the Termination Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement will relieve any Party from liability for
any breach of this Agreement.   ARTICLE X  INDEMNIFICATION   Section
10.1. Indemnification Obligations of Caterpillar and the Company. Caterpillar
and the Company, jointly and severally, agree to indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any
and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, costs, expenses, penalties,
fines and judgments (at equity or at law) and damages of any kind or nature
whenever arising or incurred (including, without limitation, amounts paid
in    47   settlement, reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable
attorneys\' fees and expenses) arising out of or relating to:   (a) any
liability or obligation of the Company or any of  its Affiliates of any
nature whatsoever, except the Assumed Liabilities  and except as otherwise
expressly covered by Sections 10.1(b) through  (i);   (b) product liability
resulting from the design of the MT  700 and MT 800 product lines of rubber
tracked tractors (other than due  to failure of components thereof
manufactured by Caterpillar, which  liability shall be governed by applicable
law or contract other than  this Agreement);   (c) any breach or inaccuracy
of any representation or  warranty made by the Company in this Agreement or
in any of the  Ancillary Documents;   (d) any breach of any covenant,
agreement or undertaking  made by the Company or any of its Affiliates in
this Agreement or in  any of the Ancillary Documents;   (e) any fraud,
willful misconduct or bad faith of the  Company or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement or  in any of the Ancillary Documents;   (f)
any provision of any Environmental Law and arising  out of or relating to (i)
any act or omission of the Company, or any of  its directors, officers,
employees, agents, representatives or  Affiliates and any of such
Affiliate\'s respective directors, officers,  employees, agents or
representatives or (ii) the ownership, use,  control or operation or any
plant, facility, site, area or property  used in the business of the Company
(whether currently or previously  owned or leased by the Company) during the
period of time owned, used,  controlled or operated by the Company or any of
its Affiliates,  including, without limitation, arising from any release of
any  Hazardous Materials or off-site shipment of any Hazardous Materials at

property;   (g) non-compliance by any of the Parties with any  applicable
bulk sales law;   (h) the Encoat Services Agreement or the Ryder Logistics 
Agreement (including, with respect to the foregoing agreements, the  business
relations between the parties thereto); or   (i) any of the JV Agreements
(including, but not limited  to, the business relations between the parties
thereto).   To the extent that the Buyer Indemnified Parties incur any
claim, liability, obligation, loss, cost, expense, penalty, fine or judgment
(at equity or at law) or damages of any kind or nature whenever arising or
incurred (including without limitation, amounts paid in settlement, cost of
investigation and reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) arising out of
any provision of any Environmental Law and arising or relating to (i) any act
or omission of any Person relating to the ownership, use, control or
operation of any Real Property or any plant, facility, site, area or property
used in the business of the Company (whether currently or previously owned or
leased    48   by the Company) prior to the period of time such property
was owned, used, controlled or operated by the Company or one of its
Affiliates, including without limitation, arising from any release of
Hazardous Materials or off-site shipment of any Hazardous Materials at or
from the Real Property or any such plant, facility, site, area or property,
then the Company will either (i) assign to the Buyer any rights that the
Company might have (whether contractual or otherwise) against a prior owner,
user, controller or operator with respect to indemnification, contribution or
otherwise arising from such matter or (ii) to the extent that such assignment
would invalidate the right, indemnify the Buyer to the fullest extent that
the Company is entitled to, and successful in, making a claim against such
prior owner, user, controller or operator (which the Company undertakes to
assert at the written request and expense of the Buyer and to pursue in
accordance with the reasonable directions of the Buyer). It is acknowledged
by the Parties that the foregoing claims, liabilities, obligations, losses,
costs, expenses, penalties, fines or judgments referenced in this paragraph
are not covered by Sections 10.1(a) through 10(i) above.   Section 10.2.
Indemnification Obligations of the Buyer. The Buyer will indemnify and hold
harmless the Company Indemnified Parties from, against and in respect of any
and all claims, liabilities, obligations, losses, costs, expenses, penalties,
fines and judgments (at equity or at law) and damages of any kind or nature
whenever arising or incurred (including, without limitation, amounts paid in
settlement, reasonable costs of investigation and reasonable attorneys\' fees
and expenses) arising out of or relating to:   (a) the Buyer\'s failure to
perform, discharge or satisfy  the Assumed Liabilities;   (b) any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or  warranty made by the Buyer in this
Agreement or in any of the Ancillary  Documents;   (c) any breach of any
covenant, agreement or undertaking  made by the Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in this Agreement or in any  of the Ancillary Documents;   (d)
any fraud, willful misconduct or bad faith of the  Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement or in  any of the Ancillary
Documents; or   (e) any liability or obligation of the Buyer or any of  its
Affiliates of any nature whatsoever arising subsequent to the  Closing which
is not expressly covered by an indemnification obligation  of the Company or
Caterpillar to the Buyer pursuant to Section 10.1,  which shall include,
without limitation, for purposes of this Section  10.2(e), all product
liabilities referred to in Section 10.1(b) as to  which a claim for
indemnification under Section 10.3 is not made prior  to the expiration of
the Claims Period specified in Section 10.4(b).   Section 10.3.
Indemnification Procedure.   (a) Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified
Party of  notice by a third party (including any Governmental Entity) of
any  complaint or the commencement of any audit, investigation, action or 
proceeding with respect to which such Indemnified Party may be entitled  to
receive payment from the other Party for any Buyer Losses or the  Company
Losses (as the case may be), such Indemnified Party will notify  the Buyer
or    49    Caterpillar, as the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"),
promptly  following the Indemnified Party\'s receipt of such complaint or
of  notice of the commencement of such audit, investigation, action or 
proceeding; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the 
Indemnifying Party will relieve the Indemnifying Party from liability  under
this Agreement with respect to such claim only if, and only to  the extent
that, the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced by such  failure to
notify. The Indemnifying Party will have the right, upon  written notice
delivered to the Indemnified Party within ten (10)  business days thereafter
to assume the defense of such audit,  investigation, action or proceeding,
including the employment of  counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnified Party and the  payment of the fees and disbursements of such
counsel. In the event,  however, that the Indemnifying Party declines or
fails to assume the  defense of the audit, investigation, action or
proceeding on the terms  provided above or to employ counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the  Indemnified Party, in either case within such ten (10)
business day  period, then such Indemnified Party may employ counsel to
represent or  defend it in any such audit, investigation, action or
proceeding and  the Indemnifying Party will pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements  of such counsel as incurred. In any audit, investigation,
action or  proceeding for which the Indemnifying Party has assumed the
defense,  the Indemnified Party will have the right to participate in such
matter  and to retain its own counsel at the Indemnified Party\'s own
expense.  The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will at all times
use  reasonable efforts to keep the other reasonably apprised of the status 
of the defense of any matter the defense of which has been assumed by  such
party and to cooperate in good faith with each other with respect  to the
defense of any such matter.   (b) No Indemnified Party may settle or
compromise any  claim or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to
which  indemnification is being sought hereunder without the prior written 
consent of the Indemnifying Party, unless (i) the Indemnifying Party  fails
to assume and maintain the defense of such claim pursuant to  Section 10.3(a)
or (ii) such settlement, compromise or consent includes  an unconditional
release of the Indemnifying Party and its officers,  directors, employees and
Affiliates from all liability arising out of  such claim. An Indemnifying
Party may not, without the prior written  consent of the Indemnified Party,
settle or compromise any claim or  consent to the entry of any judgment with
respect to which  indemnification is being sought hereunder unless (x) such
settlement,  compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of the 
Indemnified Party and its officers, directors, employees and Affiliates  from
all liability arising out of such claim, (y) does not contain any  admission
or statement suggesting any wrongdoing or liability on behalf  of the
Indemnified Party and (z) does not contain any equitable order,  judgment or
term which in any manner affects, restrains or interferes  with the business
of the Indemnified Party or any of the Indemnified  Party\'s Affiliates.  
(c) In the event an Indemnified Party claims a right to  payment pursuant to
this Agreement, such Indemnified Party will send  written notice of such
claim to the appropriate Indemnifying Party.  Such notice will specify the
basis for such claim. As promptly as  possible after the Indemnified Party
has given such notice, such  Indemnified Party and the appropriate
Indemnifying Party will establish  the merits and amount of such claim (by
mutual agreement, litigation,  arbitration or otherwise) and, within five
(5)    50    Business Days of the final determination of the merits and
amount of  such claim, the Indemnifying Party will pay to the Indemnified
Party  immediately available funds in an amount equal to such claim as 
determined hereunder.   (d) The calculation of any amount payable pursuant
to  this Article X by an Indemnifying Party shall be decreased by (x) any 
insurance proceeds received or receivable or receivable by the  Indemnified
Party under any insurance policy and (y) any cash tax  benefits received or
receivable by the Indemnified Party in the year of  the payment.   Section
10.4. Claims Period. The Claims Periods under this Agreement shall begin on
the date hereof and terminate as follows:   (a) with respect to Buyer Losses
arising (i) under  Section 10.1(c) with respect to any breach or inaccuracy
of any  Surviving Representations or (ii) with respect to the Surviving 
Obligations, the Claims Period shall continue until the expiration of  any
applicable statute of limitations;   (b) with respect to Buyer Losses
arising under Section  10.1(b), the Claims Period shall terminate on the date
that is one (1)  year after the Closing Date;   (c) with respect to Company
Losses arising under Sections  10.2(a), 10.2(c), 10.2(d) or 10.2(e), the
Claims Period shall continue  until the expiration of any applicable statute
of limitations; and   (d) with respect to all other Buyer Losses or
Company  Losses arising under this Agreement, the Claims Period shall
terminate  on the date that is three (3) years after the Closing
Date.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to the close of business on
the last day of the applicable Claims Period, an Indemnifying Party shall
have been properly notified of a claim for indemnity hereunder and such claim
shall not have been finally resolved or disposed of at such date, such claim
shall continue to survive and shall remain a basis for indemnity hereunder
until such claim is finally resolved or disposed of in accordance with the
terms hereof.   Section 10.5. Liability Limits.   (a) Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth  herein, the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall not make a claim against  Caterpillar for indemnification under this
Article X for Buyer Losses  unless and until the aggregate amount of such
Buyer Losses exceeds  Three Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($350,000) (the
"Buyer Basket"),  in which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties may claim
indemnification  for all Buyer Losses in excess of Three Hundred Fifty
Thousand Dollars  ($350,000). The total aggregate amount of Caterpillar\'s
liability for  Buyer Losses shall be limited to Ten Million Dollars
($10,000,000) (the  "Buyer Cap"); provided, however, Section 10.1(b), the
Surviving  Obligations and the Surviving Representations shall not be subject
to  the Buyer Cap.    51    (b) In computing Buyer Losses and Company
Losses, lost  profits and opportunity costs shall not be recoverable, and
recoverable  actual damages shall include the amount necessary to return
the  Indemnified Party to the same economic position it would have been in, 
with respect to out-of-pocket costs and expenditures, including the  purchase
price hereunder, absent the condition or event creating the  loss, but
otherwise shall not include consequential damages. By way of  example, (i) if
the Owned Real Property was required to be temporarily  closed due to an
occurrence described in Section 10.1(f), Buyer  Losses would include not only
the cost of remediation, but also, for  example, the cost of maintaining the
facility during the closure, the  cost of compensating non-productive
employees during the closure and  damages due third parties for non-
performance by the Buyer as a result  of the closure, and (ii) if the Buyer
had to permanently stop operating  the Business due to a breach of a
representation by the Company, Buyer  Losses might include, for example, the
original purchase price  hereunder plus out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
the Buyer in  operating the Business.   Section 10.6. Investigations. The
respective representations and warranties of the Parties contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other document delivered by any Party
prior to the Closing and the rights to indemnification set forth in Article X
will not be deemed waived or otherwise affected by any investigation made by
a Party to this Agreement.   Section 10.7. Certain Environmental Matters.
Regarding any claim, liability, obligation, loss, cost, expense, penalty,
fine, judgment (at law or equity), or damage of any kind or nature under or
relating to Environmental Laws that would otherwise be subject to
indemnification under this Article X ("Indemnified Environmental Losses"),
such Indemnified Environmental Losses shall be subject to indemnification
only to the extent consistent with the Buyer\'s reasonable efforts to
mitigate such Indemnified Environmental Losses. This Article X constitutes
the Buyer\'s sole remedy regarding any claim, liability, obligation, loss,
cost, expense, penalty, fine, judgment (at law or equity), or damage of any
kind or nature under or relating to Environmental Laws and Buyer waives any
other remedy it might have under Environmental Laws.   ARTICLE XI
