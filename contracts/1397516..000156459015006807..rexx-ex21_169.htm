adjusted as follows, without duplication, and only with respect to matters
identified on or before the date that is four (4) months after the Closing
Date:

 

(a)increased or decreased, as applicable, on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the

(c)decreased by the amount of any unpaid Indebtedness of the Company or a

2.3Closing Payment and Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments.

 

(a)Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Target Closing Date,
Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based upon the books
and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries, a preliminary settlement
statement setting forth Sellers' good faith estimate of the Purchase Price for

(3) Business Days to review such preliminary settlement statement. On the day
following expiration of such three (3) Business Day review period, Purchaser
shall submit a written report containing any changes Purchaser proposes to be
made to the settlement statement. Sellers and Purchaser shall agree on a
final settlement statement no later than one (1) Business Day prior to
Closing; provided, however, if Sellers and Purchaser

   

are unable to agree, then, subject to Section 2.3(b), Sellers' determination
shall be used to calculate the amount payable by Purchaser to Sellers at
Closing (such amount, the "Closing Payment").

 

(b)As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing but not later than the
seventy-fifth (75th) day following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare
and deliver to Sellers a draft statement setting forth the final calculation
of the Purchase Price and showing the calculation of each adjustment under
Section 2.2. Purchaser shall make such reasonable documentation as is in

reasonably practicable, but not later than the thirtieth (30th) day following
receipt of such statement from Purchaser (together with all necessary
supporting documentation), Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser a written report
containing any changes that Sellers propose be made to such statement. If
Sellers do not deliver such report to each Seller on or before the end of such
thirty (30) day period, Sellers shall be deemed to have agreed with
Purchaser's statement, and such statement shall become final and binding upon
the Parties.

 

(c)The Parties shall undertake to agree on the final statement of the Purchase
Price no later than thirty (30) days after delivery of Purchaser's statement.

nationally-recognized independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to both
Purchaser and Sellers (the "Accounting Arbitrator"), for review and final
determination by arbitration. Each Party agrees to sign, if requested by the
Accounting Arbitrator, a reasonable engagement letter and to provide indemnity
and other standard agreements that the Accounting Arbitrator requires as a
condition to the engagement.

 

(d)The Accounting Arbitrator's determination shall be made within forty-five
(45) days after submission of the matters in dispute and shall be final and
binding on all Parties, without right of appeal. In determining the proper
amount of any adjustment to the Purchase Price, the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be bound by the terms of this Article 2 and may not increase the
Purchase Price more than the greatest Purchase Price proposed by a Party nor
decrease the Purchase Price more than the lowest Purchase Price proposed by a
Party. The Accounting Arbitrator shall act as an expert for the limited
purpose of determining the specific disputed aspects of Purchase Price
adjustments submitted by any Party and may not award damages, interest (except
as expressly provided for in this Section 2.3(d)) or penalties to any Party
with respect to any matter. Sellers and Purchaser shall each bear their own
legal fees and other costs of presenting their respective cases. Sellers
(collectively) and Purchaser (individually) shall each bear one-half of the
costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator.

 

(e)Within ten (10) days after the earlier of (i) the expiration of Purchaser's
thirty (30) day review period without delivery of any written report or (ii)
the date on which the Parties or the Accounting Arbitrator finally determine
the Purchase Price (the "Finalization Date"), (x) if the Purchase Price
exceeds the Closing Payment, then the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Sellers the Escrow Amount and Purchaser shall pay such excess in
immediately available funds to Sellers or (y) if the Closing Payment exceeds
the Purchase Price, then the Parties shall cause the Escrow Agent to
distribute to Purchaser, such excess (up to the amount of the Escrow Amount),
and if the Escrow Amount is insufficient, then Sellers shall wire transfer to
Purchaser immediately available funds in the amount of such insufficiency, and
Sellers shall be entitled to receive the remaining amount, if any, of the
Escrow Amount. Any post-Closing payment pursuant to this Section 2.3(d) shall
bear interest from the Closing Date to the date of payment at the Agreed Rate.

 

(f)Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but without the
obligation to pay any amount to, or undertake any obligations for the benefit
of, Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries, or any other Person) to assist
Purchaser in preparation of the final statement of the Purchase Price under
Section 2.3(c) by furnishing invoices, receipts, reasonable access to
personnel, and such other assistance as may be requested by Purchaser to
facilitate such process.

 

(g)All payments made or to be made under this Agreement to Sellers shall be
made by electronic transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account
as may be specified by Sellers in writing, in accordance with each Seller's
Pro Rata Percentage (other than payments made pursuant to Article 10
(excluding Section 10.1(b)(iii)), which shall not be reduced in any respect
due to the Management Rollover). All payments made or to be made hereunder to
Purchaser shall be by electronic transfer or immediately available funds to a
bank and account specified by Purchaser in writing.

 

2.4Income Tax Treatment and Allocation of the Purchase Price.

 

(a)Within sixty (60) days after the determination of the Purchase Price under
Section 2.3, Sellers shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser, using and based
upon the best information available to Sellers, a schedule (the "Tax
Allocation Schedule") allocating the Purchase Price (and all other capitalized
costs) among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section 1060 of the
Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provisions of
state, local or non-U.S. Law, as appropriate) for Purchasers\' review,
comment, and approval, which approval shall not unreasonably be withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If Purchaser objects to an allocation on the Tax
Allocation Schedule, Purchaser and Sellers shall endeavor to resolve the
matter. If Purchaser and

   

Sellers are unable to agree as to such an allocation, the matter will be
referred to the Accounting Arbitrator, whose decision shall be binding. Upon
final agreement as to the allocation, the allocation shall be binding upon
Purchaser and Sellers. Purchaser shall cooperate with Sellers in the
preparation of the Tax Allocation Schedule.

 

(b)Unless a Rollover Notice has been provided to Rex, the acquisition of the
Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement shall be treated by Purchaser
and Sellers for federal and applicable state income Tax purposes as a purchase
of assets by Purchaser and sale of membership interests by Sellers, in
accordance with Revenue Ruling 99-6. In such case, the allocations set forth
in the Tax Allocation Schedule shall be used by Sellers and Purchaser as the
basis for reporting asset values and other items, including preparing Internal
Revenue Service Form 8594, Asset Acquisition Statement. Sellers and Purchaser
agree not to assert, and will cause their Affiliates not to assert, in
connection with any audit or other proceeding with respect to Taxes, any asset
values or other items inconsistent with the amounts set forth set forth on the
Tax Allocation Schedule.

the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 were prepared in conformity with

Company and the Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2013 and 2014, and their
consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal years then
ended. True, correct and complete copies of such financial statements have
been made available to Purchaser.

 

(b)The balance sheet and the related unaudited consolidated statements of
income of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the four-months ended April 30,
2015 (the "Balance Sheet Date"), true, correct and complete copies of which
are attached to Schedule 3.5(b) (the "Balance Sheet"), were prepared from the
books and records of the Company and the Subsidiaries in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the period indicated, and fairly
present the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of the Balance Sheet Date and their consolidated results of
operations for the period referred to therein, subject to normal year-end
adjustments (which are not, in the aggregate, reasonably expected to be
material) and the absence of notes otherwise required by GAAP.

 

(c)The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting
controls which are in all material respects effective in providing reasonable
assurance that (i) records are maintained in reasonable detail that fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP, (iii)
transactions are executed and expenditures of the Company and the Subsidiaries
are being made only in accordance with appropriate general or specific
authorizations of management, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets
is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals, and appropriate
action is taken with respect to any differences. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser acknowledges that (x) Rex provides an accounting control
environment compliant with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, an (y) as of the
Closing, the Company and the Subsidiaries will no longer operate in such an
environment, except to the extent provided by Purchaser. None of the Company
or any Subsidiary has entered into any off-balance sheet transactions,
arrangements or has any obligations (including contingent obligations) or
other material relationships with unconsolidated entities or other Persons.

 

(d)There are no liabilities obligations or commitments of any nature

reserved against in the Balance Sheet, (ii) liabilities not required under
GAAP to be shown on the Balance Sheet for reasons other than the contingent
nature thereof or the difficulty of determining the amount thereof; (iii)
liabilities disclosed in Schedule 3.5(d); and (iv) liabilities incurred in the
ordinary course of business since the Balance Sheet Date which, individually
or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to be material to the Company
or any Subsidiary.

 

(e)Since the Balance Sheet Date, (i) the Business has been operated in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practices, (ii) none of the
Company or the Subsidiaries have taken or omitted to take any action which,
had such action or omission occurred after the date of this Agreement, would
have violated the covenants in Section 5.3, and (iii) there has not been any
event, occurrence or development which, individually or in the aggregate, has
had or would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

   

3.6Litigation. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.6, there is no action, suit,
investigation or proceeding pending against, or to the knowledge of Sellers,
threatened against or affecting, the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their

managers, members, or employees in such capacities, before any arbitrator or
Governmental Authority that (a) involves a claim or claims seeking monetary
damages in excess of Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) in the aggregate or
injunctive or other equitable relief, or (b) in any manner challenges or seeks
to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and, to the knowledge of Sellers, there is no reasonable basis
for any of the foregoing. None of the Sellers, the Company, or any Subsidiary

(whether real, personal, tangible or intangible) and rights used in the
operation of the Business as currently conducted, and are sufficient to carry
on the Business as currently conducted. Each material tangible asset owned or

reasonable repair (subject to normal wear and tear) and has been maintained in
accordance with normal industry practice.

 

(c)None of the properties and assets (whether real, personal, tangible or
intangible) reflected on the Balance Sheet or acquired by the Company or any
Subsidiary after the Balance Sheet Date are subject to any Lien, except:

 

(i)Liens for Taxes or in respect of workers' compensation, unemployment

(iv)other non-monetary and non-financial Liens which would not, individually
or in the aggregate, materially impair the continued use of such property and
asset in the manner in which it is currently used (paragraphs (i) - (iv) of
this Section 3.10(c) are, collectively, the "Permitted Liens").

 

(d)With respect to all real property owned by the Company or any Subsidiary
(the "Owned Real Property"), there is no condemnation, expropriation or other
proceeding in eminent domain pending or, to the knowledge of Sellers,
threatened, affecting any parcel of Owned Real Property or any interest
therein. Sellers have made available to Purchaser all title insurance
policies, property condition reports, and surveys for each parcel of Owned
Real Property. The Company or a Subsidiary has exclusive possession of each
parcel of Owned Real Property. There are no outstanding options, rights of
first offer, or rights of first refusal to purchase any Owned Real Property or
any portion thereof or interest therein. None of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or option to purchase any real
property or interest therein.

 

(e)Sellers have made available to Purchaser a correct and complete copy of
each lease, sublease, license or other contract, currently in effect, under
which any real property leased, subleased, or licensed by, or for which a
right to use or occupy has been granted to, the Company or any Subsidiary
(each, a "Leased Real Property") or is occupied or used by the Company or any
Subsidiary (each, a "Company Lease"), as amended to date. Neither the Company
or the applicable Subsidiary party to any Company Lease nor, to the knowledge
of Sellers, any other party to any such Company Lease, is in breach or
default, and no event has occurred (including the failure to obtain any
consent) which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
breach or default under or permit termination or material modification of, or
acceleration of a material amount of rents due under, any Company Lease.

vehicular or pedestrian access to and from public roadways, and any and all
easements, rights of way or similar rights, as may be reasonably necessary to
the operation of the Business thereon. To the knowledge of Sellers, no fact
or condition exists which would result in the termination or impairment of (i)
the current access from each parcel of the Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property to public roadways, and (ii) continued use, operation, maintenance,
repair and replacement of all existing and currently committed equipment,
pipes, lines, systems and other infrastructure and all components thereof
(collectively, "Equipment") used by the Company and the Subsidiaries in
connection with the operation of their respective Businesses. There are no
material defects in, mechanical failure of, or damage to any Owned Real
Property or Leased Real Property or any portion thereof, including the
Equipment, which would materially and adversely affect the operation thereof,
and, excluding obsolete or worn-out Equipment not currently being used (or
contemplated to be used) in the ongoing operation of the Business in the
ordinary course, all of the Equipment located at or on the Owned Real Property
or Leased Real Property is in good working condition, ordinary wear and tear
excepted.

 

(g)All water, oil, gas, electrical, steam, compressed air, telecommunications,
sewer, storm and waste water systems and other utility services or systems for
the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property have been properly installed
and are operational and sufficient for the operation of the Business as
currently conducted thereon. The current use and occupancy of the Owned Real
Property and Leased Real Property and the operation of the Business as
currently conducted thereon do not violate any easement, covenant, condition,
restriction or similar provision in any instrument of record or other
unrecorded agreement affecting such Owned Real Property and Leased Real
Property.

cancellation, termination or non-renewal has been received with respect to any
such policy.

 

3.15Intellectual Property.

Intellectual Property Rights owned by the Company or any Subsidiary. All of
the foregoing Intellectual Property Rights are subsisting, and to the
knowledge of Sellers, valid and enforceable.

 

(b)No Intellectual Property Right owned by the Company or any Subsidiary is
being infringed or misappropriated by any third party, and neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary is infringing or misappropriating any valid and enforceable

collected, maintained or stored by or on behalf of the Company or any of
Subsidiaries, (iii) any trade secrets and other confidential information that

(b)Each Employee Plan has been established, administered and maintained in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and in compliance with all
applicable Laws (including without limitation ERISA and the Code). All
benefits, contributions and premiums required by and due under the terms of
each Employee Plan or applicable Law have been timely paid in accordance with
the terms of such Employee Plan, and in material compliance with all
applicable Laws and the required Accounting Principles. There is no unfunded
Employee Plan that provides a pension, retirement or post-employment welfare
benefit.

 

(c)Each Employee Plans intended to be qualified under Section 401 of the Code
has received a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue
Service, or with respect to a prototype plan, can rely on an opinion letter
from the Internal Revenue Service to the prototype plan sponsor, to the effect
that such Employee Plan is so qualified and that the plan and the trust
related thereto are exempt from federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and
501(a), respectively, of the Code. Nothing has occurred that could reasonably
be expected to cause the revocation of such determination letter from the
Internal Revenue Service or

   

the unavailability of reliance on such opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service or which may materially and adversely affect the qualified
status of the Employee Plan.

 

(d)No Employee Plan: (i) is subject to the minimum funding standards of
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code; (ii) is subject to Title IV
of ERISA; (iii) is a "multi-employer plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of
ERISA); or (iv) is a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of Section
4063 or 4064 of ERISA. Neither Seller nor any Company: (i) has withdrawn from
any pension plan under circumstances resulting (or expected to result) in a
liability to the PBGC or (ii) has engaged in any transaction which would give
rise to a liability of either Company or Purchaser under Section 4069 or
Section 4212(c) of ERISA.

 

(e)There is no pending or, to Sellers' knowledge, threatened action, suit or
proceeding relating to an Employee Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits), and no Employee Plan has within the three years prior to the date
hereof been the subject of an examination or audit by a Governmental Authority
or the subject of an application or filing under or is a participant in, an
amnesty, voluntary compliance, self-correction or similar program sponsored by
any Governmental Authority.

 

(f)Except as set forth in Schedule 3.19, neither the execution of this
Agreement nor any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
(either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or subsequent events):
(i) entitle any current or former manager, officer, employee, independent
contractor or consultant of the Company or any Subsidiary to severance pay or
any other payment; (ii) accelerate the time of payment, funding or vesting, or
increase the amount of compensation due to any such individual; (iii) limit or
restrict the right of the Company or any Subsidiary to merge, amend or
terminate any Employee Plan; or (iv) increase the amount payable under or
result in any other material obligation pursuant to any Employee Plan. Neither
the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) will result in "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code or require a "gross-up" or other
payment to any "disqualified individual" within the meaning of Section 280G(c)
of the Code. Sellers have made available to Purchaser true and complete copies
of any Section 280G calculations prepared (whether or not final) with respect
to any disqualified individual in connection with the transactions.

 

(g)Except as set forth in Schedule 3.19 and other than as required under
Section 4980B of the Code or other applicable Law, no Employee Plan provides
benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or disability insurance
following retirement or other termination of employment (other than death
benefits when termination occurs upon death).

 

(h)Each Employee Plan that is subject to Section 409A of the Code has been
administered in compliance with its terms and the operational and documentary
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and all applicable regulatory
guidance (including notices, rulings and proposed and final regulations)
thereunder. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any obligation to
gross up, indemnify or otherwise reimburse any individual for any excise
taxes, interest or penalties incurred pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

 

3.20Consents. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.20, the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement and the other documents required to be
executed and delivered at Closing by each Seller, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (a) require no action by or in
respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Authority, other than compliance
with the HSR Act, and (b) do not and will not constitute a default under, or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration under any
agreement or other instrument binding on such Seller, the Company, or any
Subsidiary.

 

3.21Limitations.

 

(a)Except as and to the extent expressly set forth in this Article 3 or in the
certificate of each Seller to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(f), (i)
Sellers make no representations or warranties, express or implied and (ii)
Sellers expressly disclaims all liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, statement, or information made or communicated
(whether orally, in writing, electronically, or otherwise) to Purchaser or any
of its Affiliates, employees, agents, consultants, or representatives
(including any opinion, information, projection, or advice that may have been
provided to or for the benefit of Purchaser by any officer, director,
employee, agent, consultant, representative, or advisor of either Seller or
any of its Affiliates).

 

(b)EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY REPRESENTED OTHERWISE IN THIS ARTICLE 3 OR IN THE
CERTIFICATE OF EACH SELLERS TO BE DELIVERED AT CLOSING PURSUANT TO SECTION
7.2(F), SELLERS MAKE NO, AND HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM, ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY AS TO (I) TITLE TO ANY OF THE ASSETS
OF THE BUSINESS; (II) THE CONTENTS, CHARACTER, OR NATURE OF ANY DESCRIPTIVE
MEMORANDUM, REPORT, STUDY, PRESENTATION OR SUMMARY, ABSTRACT, OR DERIVATIVE
WORK BASED ON, OR RELATING TO, THE COMPANY, THE SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE BUSINESS,
(III) FUTURE COSTS OR REVENUES RELATING TO, OR ARISING FROM, THE OWNERSHIP OF
THE SHARES, THE COMPANY, THE SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE BUSINESS; (IV) THE EXISTENCE

   

OF ANY PROSPECT, EXPANSION, OR OPPORTUNITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS, THE
COMPANY, THE SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE SHARES; (V) ANY ESTIMATES OF THE VALUE OF
SHARES, BUSINESS, SUBSIDIARIES, OR THE COMPANY, OR THE ASSETS THEREOF OR
FUTURE REVENUES TO BE GENERATED, OR COSTS INCURRED, BY ANY OF THE FOREGOING;
(VI) THE MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, CONDITION, QUALITY, SUITABILITY, DESIGN OR
MARKETABILITY OF ANY ASSETS OWNED OR LEASED BY THE COMPANY OR THE
SUBSIDIARIES, OR OTHERWISE INCLUDED IN THE BUSINESS; (VII) INFRINGEMENT OF ANY
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT; (VIII) ANY OTHER MATERIALS OR INFORMATION THAT
MAY HAVE BEEN MADE AVAILABLE OR COMMUNICATED TO PURCHASER OR ITS AFFILIATES,
OR ITS OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, CONSULTANTS, REPRESENTATIVES, OR ADVISORS
IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY
DISCUSSION OR PRESENTATION RELATING THERETO AND (IX) COMPLIANCE WITH ANY LAW
(INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS), AND FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR CONFORMITY TO MODELS OR SAMPLES OF MATERIALS OF ANY
EQUIPMENT OR OTHER ASSETS, IT BEING EXPRESSLY UNDERSTOOD AND AGREED BY THE
PARTIES THAT, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS ARTICLE 3, THE SHARES, THE
COMPANY, THE SUBSIDIARIES, AND ALL ASSETS THEREOF OR THAT OTHERWISE RELATE TO
THE BUSINESS, ARE BEING TRANSFERRED "AS IS, WHERE IS".

 

(c)Any representation qualified "to the knowledge of Sellers," "to the
knowledge of any Seller," "to Sellers' knowledge," or by phrases of similar
import, is limited to matters within the actual, personal knowledge, after
reasonable inquiry of (i) the internal files and records of Sellers, the
Company, and each Subsidiary and (ii) employees or other representatives of
Sellers, the Company, or any Subsidiary who are or would be expected to be
knowledgeable with respect to the relevant subject matter or any particular
matter relating thereto (but without any duty of further investigation), of
the individuals identified on Schedule 3.21.

 

(d)Inclusion of a matter on a schedule attached hereto with respect to a
representation or warranty that addresses matters having a Material Adverse
Effect shall not be deemed an indication that such matter does, or may, have a
Material Adverse Effect. Schedules may include matters not required by the
terms of the Agreement to be listed on the Schedule, which additional matters
are disclosed for purposes of information only, and inclusion of any such
matter does not mean that all such matters are included. A matter scheduled
as an exception for any representation shall be deemed to be an exception to
all other representations for which its relevance is reasonably apparent on
its face.

Company in the possession or control of any Seller, the Company, or the
Subsidiaries, for the purpose of conducting a due diligence review of the
Business and for transition and integration planning, but only to the extent
that Sellers may do so without (a) violating

   

applicable Laws, including the HSR Act or (b) violating any obligations to any
third Person and to the extent that Sellers have authority to grant such
access without breaching any restriction binding on any Seller, the Company,
or any Subsidiary. Such reasonable access by Purchaser shall be limited to

hours, and Purchaser's investigation shall be conducted in a manner that does
not materially interfere with the operation of the Business or the other
businesses of either Seller or its Affiliates. Purchaser's right of access
shall not entitle Purchaser to operate equipment or conduct intrusive or
environmental testing or sampling. Purchaser shall provide Sellers with
reasonable advance written notice before the Business is accessed pursuant to

by any Seller or its Affiliates) or Sellers (in the case of announcements by
Purchaser or its Affiliates), which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, the foregoing shall not

or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the disclosing Party or its Affiliates; (b) that are
necessary for a Party to perform this Agreement (including disclosure to a
Governmental Authority or any third Persons holding rights of consent or other
rights that may be applicable to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as reasonably necessary to provide notices, seek waivers,
amendments or termination of such rights, or seek such consents); or (c)
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, if such Party has given the other
Party a reasonable opportunity to review such disclosure prior to its release
and no objection is raised; provided, further, that, in the case of clauses
(a) and (b), each Party shall use its reasonable efforts to consult with the
other Party regarding the contents of any such release or announcement prior
to making such release or announcement. Sellers and Purchaser shall each be

Seller, the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Affiliates make any agreement in connection with the foregoing which would, or
would reasonably be expected to, limit the conduct of the Business on or after
the Closing Date; or

 

(n)agree, resolve or commit to do any of the foregoing.

 

Requests for approval of any action restricted by this Section 5.3 shall be
delivered to any of the following individuals, each of whom shall have full
authority to grant or deny such requests for approval on behalf of Purchaser:

Purchaser's approval of any action restricted by this Section 5.3 shall not be

within fourteen (14) days of Sellers' notice to Purchaser requesting such
consent unless Purchaser notifies Sellers to the contrary during that period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.3, in the event of
an emergency, Sellers may take such actions as may be reasonably necessary in
light of the magnitude and nature of such emergency, and Sellers shall give
notice to Purchaser of such emergency and any actions taken or proposed to be
taken in connection therewith or with respect thereto as promptly as
practicable following the occurrence of such emergency.

 

5.4Indemnity Regarding Access. Purchaser's access to the assets of the
Business and its (and its Affiliates' and representatives') examinations and
inspections, this Agreement or otherwise, shall be at Purchaser's sole risk,
cost, and expense, and Purchaser WAIVES AND RELEASES ALL CLAIMS AGAINST
SELLERS, THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES, AND EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE PARTNERS,
MEMBERS, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, ATTORNEYS, CONTACTORS, AGENTS, OR
OTHER REPRESENTATIVES, ARISING IN ANY WAY THEREFROM, OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED
THEREWITH. Purchaser agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Sellers
and their Affiliates and all such Persons' directors, officers, employees,
agents, and representatives from and against any and all claims, liabilities,
losses, costs, and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorneys'
fees), including claims, liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses attributable
to personal injury, death, or property damage, arising out of, or relating to,
access to the assets and properties of the Business prior to the Closing by
Purchaser, its Affiliates, or its or their respective directors, officers,
employees, agents, or representatives, EVEN IF CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY
THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT, OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY, OR
OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY INDEMNIFIED PERSON. PURCHASER RECOGNIZES AND AGREES
THAT ALL MATERIALS, DOCUMENTS, SAMPLES, REPORTS, AND OTHER

   

INFORMATION OF ANY TYPE AND NATURE MADE AVAILABLE TO IT, ITS AFFILIATES OR
REPRESENTATIVES, IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY,

5.5Reasonable Best Efforts; Governmental Reviews.

 

(a)Each Party shall cooperate with the other Party and use its respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do, or cause to be done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause
the conditions to the Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable and
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including preparing and
filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary filings,
notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of
information, applications, and other documents (including any required or
recommended filings under the HSR Act); (ii) obtain as promptly as
practicable, all approvals, consents, clearances, expirations or terminations
of waiting periods, registrations, permits, authorizations, and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third Person necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (iii) defend any proceeding challenging this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. In using their
"reasonable best efforts" Purchaser shall (and Sellers, at the reasonable
request of Purchaser, shall cooperate with Purchaser to) take any and all
steps to avoid or eliminate impediments and any Proceeding instituted or
threatened by a Governmental Authority or private party under the HSR Act or
any other applicable antitrust or competition Law that is asserted with
respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
documents contemplated hereby so as to enable the consummation of such
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby as expeditiously as possible and,
in any event, by the Closing Date, including negotiating a resolution to or
opposing vigorously and fully any such challenge, promptly appealing any
adverse decision or order by a Governmental Authority, and litigating any such
challenge to a final non-appealable order; provided, however, that Sellers
shall not be obligated to take (or cause or allow the Company or Subsidiaries
to take) any such action unless the taking of such action is expressly
conditioned upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the documents contemplated hereby.

 

(b)Without limiting the foregoing, Sellers and Purchaser shall each in a
timely manner, but in any event within ten (10) days of the date hereof, make
(or cause their applicable Affiliates to make) (i) all required filings, and
prepare applications to, and conduct negotiations with, each Governmental
Authority as to which such filings, applications or negotiations are necessary
or appropriate in the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including filings required under the HSR Act, which filings shall include a
request for early termination of any applicable waiting period and (ii)
provide such information as the other may reasonably request in order to make
such filings, prepare such applications and conduct such negotiations. Each
Party shall cooperate with and use all reasonable efforts to assist the other
with respect to such filings, applications and negotiations. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Party shall cause its counsel to supply to each other
Party copies of the date stamped receipt copy of the cover letters delivering
the filings or submissions required under the HSR Act to any Governmental
Authority. Purchaser shall bear the cost of all filing or application fees
payable to any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, regardless of whether Purchaser, any Seller,
or any Affiliate of any of them is required to make the payment.

 

(c)The Parties shall consult with each other prior to taking any material
substantive position with respect to the filings under the HSR Act, in any
written submission to, or, to the extent practicable, in any discussions with,
any Governmental Authority. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Party shall permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and shall
consider in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any
analyses, presentations, memoranda, briefs, written arguments, opinions,
written proposals, or other materials to be submitted to the Governmental
Authorities with respect to such filings. Each Party shall keep the other
apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and
communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including promptly notifying the
other of any material communication it receives from any Governmental
Authority relating to any review or investigation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act. The Parties shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use their reasonable best efforts
to, provide each other with copies of all material, substantive
correspondence, filings, or communications between them or any of their
respective representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
materials may be redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of
the Company, the Subsidiary, and the Business; (ii) as necessary to comply
with contractual arrangements or applicable Laws; and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable attorney-client or other privilege or confidentiality
concerns.

   

(d)Subject to applicable Law, and except as required by any Governmental
Authority, neither Purchaser nor Sellers shall (i) agree to extend any waiting
period under the HSR Act without the prior written consent of the other Party
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed); (ii)
enter into any agreement with any Governmental Authority not to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the
prior written consent of the other Party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed); or (iii) take any other action that would
be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay the receipt of any
governmental or non-governmental consent, authorization or approval, in each
case, to the extent necessary for the timely consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.6Employee Matters.

 

(a)All employees of the Business who continue in the employ of the Company or
the Subsidiaries, as applicable, are referred to herein as "Continuing
Employees." Commencing on the Closing Date and continuing through the date
that is twelve (12) months following the Closing Date (or if earlier, the date
of the employee's termination of employment with the Company), Purchaser shall
provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee with (i) base
salary or hourly wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages
provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Closing; (ii) target bonus opportunities (excluding equity-based
compensation), if any, which are no less than the target bonus opportunities
(excluding equity-based compensation) provided by the Company or the
applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing; (iii) retirement and
welfare benefits that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those
provided by the Company or the applicable Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Closing; and (iv) the greater of (1) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the practice, plan or policy in effect for such Continuing
Employee immediately prior to the Closing under an Employee Plan, or (2)
severance benefits offered under a Purchaser Employee Plan (as defined below)
on terms that are no less favorable than those offered to similarly situated
employees of Purchaser. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring Purchaser, the Company, or any Subsidiary to continue the employment
of any specific person.

 

(b)Purchaser shall, with respect to each of the Continuing Employees, provide
severance benefits to such individuals in the amounts listed in Schedule 5.6.

 

(c)Purchaser shall maintain any Employee Plan that is maintained or sponsored
by the Company or any Subsidiary after Closing until such time as each
Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in, and, if such
Continuing Employee so elects, shall commence participation in, each of the
employee benefit plans (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA),
programs, policies, fringe benefits, or arrangements of Purchaser or its
Affiliates. Alternatively, Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee credit for prior
service with either Seller, the Company, any applicable Subsidiary, or their
respective Affiliates for all purposes (including vesting, eligibility,
benefit accrual and/or level of benefits) in all Purchaser Employee Plans in
which such Continuing Employee participates following the Closing Date (other
than defined benefit pension plans and any non-qualified plan provided for a
select group of management or highly compensated employees), including fringe
benefit plans, vacation and sick leave policies, severance plans or policies,
defined contribution pension plans, retiree medical plans and matching
contributions under defined contribution plans maintained or provided by
Purchaser or its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing Date; provided, however, that, except as
expressly provided in this Section 5.6, such service need not be recognized to
the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits
for the same period of service.

 

(d)During the calendar year in which the Closing occurs, Purchaser or its
Affiliates shall maintain the Company's and each Subsidiary's vacation policy
with respect to each Continuing Employee and shall credit each such individual
with all earned but unused vacation earned as of the Closing Date with respect
to any year prior to 2015, as determined under any and all of the Company's
and applicable Subsidiary's time off policies. Each Continuing Employee shall
be entitled in 2015 to the greater of (i) such Continuing Employee's earned
but unused vacation, as of the Closing Date, with respect to calendar year
2015 under the Company's (or the applicable Subsidiary's) vacation policy or
(ii) the number of vacation days with respect to calendar year 2015 to which
such Continuing Employee is entitled under Purchaser's vacation policy, less
any 2015 vacation days used by such Continuing Employee prior to the Closing
Date. No Continuing Employee will be allowed to carry forward any unused
vacation time beyond 2015 unless allowed under Purchaser's vacation policy.
With respect to each year after 2015, Purchaser shall consider each Continuing
Employee's prior full-time service with the Company or any Subsidiary in
determining the amount of vacation the Continuing Employee will be eligible
for under Purchaser's vacation policy. Continuing Employees will be eligible
to participate in short term disability and long term disability plans
sponsored by Purchaser for its eligible employees on the Closing Date.

 

(e)If a plant closing or a mass layoff occurs or is deemed to occur with
respect to the Continuing Employees at any time on or after the Closing,
Purchaser shall be solely responsible for providing all notices required under
the WARN Act, including coordinating with the Company and the Subsidiaries to
ensure any required pre-Closing notices are sent and, if notices are unable to
be timely sent, payment of all amounts, penalties, liabilities, costs and
expenses.

   

(f)Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend any Employee Plan or affect
any Seller's, the Company's, a Subsidiary's, or any ERISA Affiliate's right to
amend or terminate any Employee Plan pursuant to the terms of such plan.
Nothing in this Agreement is intended to amend any Purchaser Employee Plan or
affect Purchaser's or any of Purchaser's Affiliate's right to amend or
terminate any Purchaser Employee Plan pursuant to the terms of such plan.
This Section 5.6 shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 5.6, express or
implied, shall confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 5.6. Nothing contained
herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify
any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this Section 5.6 shall not
create any right in any employee or any other Person to any continued
employment with the Company, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates
or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 

5.7Releases. Effective as of the Closing, and without the necessity of any
further action, Sellers, for themselves and their Affiliates (other than the
Company and the Subsidiaries), and each of their respective, officers,
directors, managers, employees, agents, members and shareholders and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, the "Releasors"), hereby
forever fully and irrevocably releases and discharges the Company and each
Subsidiary and each current or former director, manager or officer of each
member of the Company and each Subsidiary (collectively, the "Released
Parties") from any and all actions, suits, claims, demands, debts, agreements,
obligations, promises, judgments, or liabilities of any kind whatsoever in law
or equity and causes of action of every kind and nature (including claims for
damages, costs, expense, and attorneys', brokers' and accountants fees and
expenses) arising out of or related to events, facts, conditions, or
circumstances existing or arising prior to the Closing, whether out of a
breach of such Person's fiduciary duty to Sellers or otherwise, which the
Releasors have or may have against the Released Parties, whether known or
unknown, suspected or unsuspected, unanticipated or anticipated, accrued or
unaccrued as of the Closing (collectively, the "Released Claims"), and hereby
irrevocably agree to refrain from directly or indirectly asserting any claim
or demand or commencing (or causing to be commenced) any suit, arbitration,
claim, action, or other proceedings against any Released Party based upon any
Released Claim.

 

5.8Loans. At or prior to Closing, Sellers shall have satisfied or caused the
Company and Subsidiaries to satisfy, all outstanding third-party Loans
described on Schedule 5.8 (and shall by such time cause all liens and
mortgages securing such indebtedness to be released). Sellers and Purchaser
(at Sellers' sole cost and expense) shall cooperate reasonably to cause any
lenders, obligees, and other relevant third Persons with respect to any such
Loans and other obligations with respect to the Business by which any Seller
is bound (other than the Rex Commercial Agreement) to have released Sellers
(and any Affiliates of Sellers after Closing) from guarantees, liens, security
interests, and other continuing liability with respect to any Loans.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall satisfy all amounts under the
Line of Credit prior to the Closing, and Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, at Purchaser's sole cost and expense, and with Purchaser's
reasonable cooperation, including obtaining any consents required from any
lenders, obligees or other relevant third Persons, such that the Line of
Credit remains outstanding and available for use by the Company and the
relevant Subsidiaries following Closing.

 

5.9Further Assurances. After Closing, Sellers and Purchaser each agree to
take such further actions and to execute, acknowledge and deliver all such
further documents as are reasonably requested by the other for carrying out
the purposes of this Agreement or of any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries to reasonably cooperate
with Rex and its agents and representatives, and provide such Persons
reasonable access, on reasonable prior written notice to Purchaser and the
Company, and during normal business hours, to the books, records, and
management personnel of the Company and the Subsidiaries, in connection with
compliance by Rex with its Tax, financial, or other reporting requirements and
audits, including delivery, at Rex's sole cost and expense following a
reasonable request therefor, of one or more customary representation letters
from the Company and Subsidiaries to Rex's auditors as may be required for
such auditors to complete an audit or review of financial statements and to
issue an acceptable opinion with respect to such audit or review; provided,
that any such access or requests shall be conducted in a manner not to
unreasonably interfere with the businesses or operations of Purchaser, the
Company or the Subsidiaries.

 

5.10Exclusivity. From and after the date hereof and until the earlier of the
Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, except for the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (a) without
the prior written consent of Purchaser, neither Seller shall, and shall cause
the Company, the Subsidiaries, and their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers, agents, employees, general partners, members, stockholders, advisors
or representatives not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, encourage or enter
into any negotiation, discussion, contract, agreement, instrument, arrangement
or understanding with any Person, with respect to the sale of the Shares or
any shares, membership interests or other voting or equity interests of any
Subsidiary, or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or any
Subsidiary, or any merger, recapitalization or similar transaction with
respect to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries, and (b) in the event that
either Seller, the Company or any Subsidiary or any of their respective
Affiliates, directors, officers, agents, employees, general partners, members,
stockholders, advisors or representatives receives any proposal with respect
to any of the matters described in the foregoing clause (a), Sellers shall
promptly (but in no event later than 24 hours) communicate to Purchaser the
existence of any such proposal.

   

5.11Termination of Affiliate Obligations. Except with respect to liabilities
relating to employment relationships and the payment of compensation and
benefits in the ordinary course of business, and except for the matters
described on Schedule 5.11, Sellers shall terminate, sever, or assign to a
Seller (in each case with appropriate mutual releases) effective as of or
prior to the Closing, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, Indebtedness
and obligations between the Company and the Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and
Seller or its Affiliates (other than the Company and the Subsidiaries), on the
other hand (collectively, the "Terminated Affiliate Obligations"). On and
after the Closing, none of Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries or any of
their Affiliates shall have any obligations or liabilities arising out of or
pursuant to any Terminated Affiliate Obligations.

 

5.12Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation; Confidentiality.

 

(a)Other than the ownership or operation by Rex of assets that are used or
held for use in connection with its exploration and production business from
time to time that are of a type and nature used or held for use by Rex as of
the date hereof in connection with its exploration and production business,
provided that such operation and use does not compete with the Business with
respect to third Persons [REDACTED]* (the "Excluded EandP Business"), for a
period of [REDACTED]* from and after the Closing Date (the "Noncompetition
Period"), neither of the Sellers nor their respective Affiliates shall,
directly or indirectly, whether as principal, agent, partner, officer,
director, stockholder, employee, consultant or otherwise, alone or in
association with any other Person, own, manage, operate, control, participate
in, invest in (other than (i) an investment that results in such Person owning
less than 2% of the outstanding voting stock of a publicly traded company,
(ii) the acquisition by a Party, whether through merger, change of control,
assignment of assets, or otherwise, of a Person, or the assets of a Person,
(A) that, on the effective date of the acquisition, derives no more than the
lesser of (x) [REDACTED]* or (y) [REDACTED]* of its annual revenues from
activities that are directly or indirectly in competition with the Business or
(B) solely because such Person or such assets or business would, if owned or
undertaken by Rex, constitute the Excluded EandP Business, or (iii) the
acquisition of either Seller or any of its Affiliates by a third Person), or,
subject to the foregoing parenthetical, carry on a business which, directly or
indirectly, is in competition with the Business [REDACTED]*.

 

(b)For [REDACTED]* after the Closing Date, neither of the Sellers nor their
respective Affiliates shall, whether for their own account or for the account
of any Person, solicit, offer employment to or hire any individual that is
employed by the Company or any of the Subsidiaries on the Closing Date;
provided, however, Sellers and their respective Affiliates shall not be
prohibited from (i) initiating searches for employees through the use of non-
directed general advertisement or through the engagement of firms to conduct
searches that are not targeted or focused on the Company and the Subsidiaries
or (ii) soliciting, hiring, or employing any Person that has been terminated
by (or who has terminated his or her employment with) Purchaser, the Company,
or the relevant Subsidiary, provided that, unless the [REDACTED]* period
provided for herein has earlier terminated, [REDACTED]* shall have elapsed
from the date of such termination.

 

(c)After the Closing, each Seller shall (and shall cause each of their
Affiliates to) maintain as confidential, and shall not (and shall cause each
of their Affiliates not to) use or disclose, except as required by Law or as
authorized in writing by Purchaser, any Confidential Information. Each Seller
shall take all appropriate steps (and to cause each of its Affiliates to take
all appropriate steps) to safeguard such Confidential Information and to
protect it against disclosure, misuse, espionage, loss and theft, using the
standard of care that they each use to protect their own similar confidential
information (and in no event less than a reasonable standard of care). In the
event a Seller or any of their Affiliates is required by Law to disclose any
Confidential Information, such Seller shall promptly notify Purchaser in
writing, which notification shall include the nature of the legal requirement
and the extent of the required disclosure, and shall cooperate reasonably with
Purchaser to preserve the confidentiality of such information consistent with
applicable Law. The foregoing shall not apply to press releases or other
announcements pursuant to Section 5.2 or Confidential Information that (i) is
or becomes generally available to the public, other than as a result of breach
of this Section 5.12(c) by a Seller; (ii) is acquired independently from a
third Person that represents to a Seller or its Affiliate that it has, and
Seller or such Affiliate does not otherwise have reason to believe that such
Person does not have, the right to disseminate such information at the time it
is acquired by Seller; or (iii) is used by Rex in connection with the Excluded
EandP Business; or (iv) is used or disclosed by a Seller in the enforcement of
this Agreement or its rights hereunder or under any document executed pursuant
to the transactions contemplated hereby. The Confidentiality Agreement shall
terminate and be of no further force or effect as of the Closing.

 

(d)Sellers acknowledge and agree that the remedy at law for any breach, or
threatened breach, of any of the provisions of this Section 5.12 will be
inadequate and, accordingly, each Seller covenants and agrees that Purchaser
shall, in addition to any other rights and remedies which Purchaser may have
at Law, be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief, and to
the remedy of specific performance with respect to any breach or threatened
breach of such covenant, as may be available from any court of competent
jurisdiction. In addition, each Seller and Purchaser agree that the terms of
the covenant in this Section 5.12 are fair and reasonable and are necessary to
accomplish the full transfer of the goodwill and other intangible assets
contemplated hereby. In the event that any of the covenants contained in this
Section 5.12 shall be determined by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable for any reason whatsoever, then any such provision or provisions
shall not be deemed void, and the parties hereto agree

   

that said limits may be modified by the court and that said covenant contained
in this Section 5.12 shall be amended in accordance with said modification, it
being specifically agreed by the parties that it is their continuing desire
that this covenant be enforced to the full extent of its terms and conditions
or if a court finds the scope of the covenant unenforceable, the court should
redefine the covenant so as to comply with applicable Law. Each Seller shall
be responsible for compliance with the terms of this Section 5.12 severally
and not jointly.

 

5.13Replacement of Bonds, Letters of Credit and Guarantees. The Parties
understand that none of the bonds, supplemental bonds, third Person
indemnities, letters of credit, and guarantees, if any, posted by Sellers, or
any other Affiliate of the Company, or any Affiliate thereof with or for the
benefit of any Governmental Authority or third Person and relating to the
Business will be transferred to, or remain outstanding for the benefit of
Purchaser. On or before Closing, Purchaser (or one of its Affiliates) shall
obtain, or cause to be obtained in the name of Purchaser (or one of its
Affiliates), replacements for such bonds, supplemental bonds, third Person
indemnities, letters of credit, and guarantees, and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts cause, effective as of the Closing, the cancellation or
return to Sellers (or Sellers' applicable continuing Affiliate), of the bonds,
supplemental bonds, third Person indemnities, letters of credit, and
guarantees posted (or supported) by any Seller or any such Affiliates.

the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and not jointly, and hold
harmless Purchaser, the Company, and their respective Affiliates from and
against all Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Period; provided, however, that Sellers shall be liable only to the extent
that such Taxes exceed the amount, if any, reserved

   

for such Taxes (excluding any reserve for deferred Taxes established to

in determining the Purchase Price after giving effect to all the adjustments
set forth in Section 2.2.

5.3(e) of this Agreement and to the extent not already currently in force,
Sellers shall make a valid election under Section 754 of the Code on the
Company's federal income Tax Return for the Tax period ending on the Closing
Date.

 

(b)Any Tax Return required to be filed by Purchaser relating to any Straddle
Period shall be submitted (with copies of any relevant schedules, work papers
and other documentation then available) to Sellers for Sellers' written
approval not less than forty-five (45) days prior to the due date for the
filing of such Tax Return, which written approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed. If a Seller objects to a Straddle Period
Tax Return, Purchaser and Sellers shall endeavor to resolve the matter. If
Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree as to the Straddle Period Tax
Return, the matter will be referred to the Accounting Arbitrator, whose
decision shall be binding.

 

8.3Access to Information.

 

(a)From and after Closing, Sellers shall grant to Purchaser (or its designees)
reasonable access at all reasonable times to the information, books, and
records relating to the Company or the Subsidiaries within the possession of
Sellers (including work papers and correspondence with taxing authorities, but
excluding work product of and attorney-client communications with any Seller's
legal counsel and personnel files), and shall afford Purchaser (or its
designees) the right (at Purchaser's expense) to take extracts therefrom and
to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Purchaser
(or its designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct negotiations with Tax
authorities, and to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend
any claims between the Parties arising under, this Agreement.

 

(b)From and after Closing, Purchaser shall grant to Sellers (or Sellers'
designees) reasonable access at all reasonable times to the information,
books, and records relating to the Company and its subsidiaries within the
possession of Purchaser, the Company or its subsidiaries (including work
papers and correspondence with taxing authorities, but excluding work product
of and attorney-client communications with any of Purchaser's legal counsel
and personnel files), and shall afford Sellers (or Sellers' designees) the
right (at Sellers' expense) to take extracts therefrom and to make copies
thereof, to the extent reasonably necessary to permit Sellers (or Sellers'
designees) to prepare Tax Returns, to conduct negotiations with, or contest
deficiencies asserted by, Tax authorities, and to implement the provisions of,
or to investigate or defend any claims between the Parties arising under, this
Agreement.

 

(c)Each of the Parties shall preserve and retain all schedules, work papers,
and other documents within such Party's possession relating to any Tax Returns
of, or with respect to, Taxes of the Company or the Subsidiaries or to any
claims, audits or other proceedings affecting the Company or the Subsidiaries
until the expiration of the statute of limitations (including extensions)
applicable to the taxable period to which such documents relate or until the
final determination of any controversy with respect to such taxable period,
and until the final determination of any payments that may be required with
respect to such taxable period under this Agreement.

   

(d)At either Purchaser's or Sellers' request, the other Party shall provide
reasonable access to Purchaser's or Sellers', as the case may be, and their
respective Affiliates' (including the Company's and the Subsidiaries')
personnel who have knowledge of the information described in this Section 8.3.

 

(e)In the case of any Tax Return to be prepared pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 8, if the Party that is not preparing the Tax Return (or any of
its Affiliates) is required to pay any Taxes shown on the Tax Return, then the
Party preparing the Tax Return shall provide the Party not preparing the Tax
Return with appropriate documentation and computations reasonably requested by
such latter Party supporting the determinations made by the Party preparing
the Tax Return as to the amount of Tax so due by the Party not preparing the
Tax Return (or any of its Affiliates).

 

8.4Contest Provisions. If, after the Closing, Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates receive notice of any pending or threatened Tax audits or
assessments or other disputes, assessments or proceedings concerning Taxes
with respect to which Sellers may incur indemnification liability under this
Agreement (a "Tax Proceeding"), Purchaser shall promptly notify Sellers of the
Tax Proceeding in writing and in any event within ten (10) days after
receiving the notice of the Tax Proceeding. If the Tax Proceeding involves a
non-Straddle Period Tax Return for which Sellers may incur indemnification
liability under this Agreement, Sellers shall control the Tax Proceeding. If
the Tax Proceeding involves a Straddle Period Tax Return for which Sellers may
incur indemnification liability under this Agreement, Purchaser shall control
the Tax Proceeding. In either situation, Sellers shall have the right to
participate in any such Tax Proceeding and to employ counsel of their choice
at their expense. Purchaser shall have the right to participate in any such
Tax Proceeding at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither
Party shall be entitled to settle, either administratively or after the
commencement of litigation, that portion of a Tax Proceeding for which the
other Party may incur an indemnification obligation or that would result in
increased liability for such Other Party for Taxes without the prior written
consent of that other Partner, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

8.5Post-Closing Actions Which Affect Sellers' Tax Liability. Neither
Purchaser nor any Affiliate of Purchaser shall amend, refile, or otherwise
modify any Tax Return relating in whole or in part to the Company or the
Subsidiaries with respect to any taxable year or period ending on or before
the Closing Date or any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
Sellers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed in the event of a Straddle Period Tax Return, but may be withheld in
the sole discretion of either Seller in the event of any Tax Return for any
taxable year or period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 

8.6Refunds.

 

(a)Any refunds of Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Period shall be for
the account of Sellers and shall be paid by Purchaser to Sellers (in
proportion to their respective interests in the Company prior to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) within five (5) days of receipt
of any such refund except to the extent that such Tax refund was taken into
account for purposes of calculating the Purchase Price after giving effect to
all adjustments set forth in Section 2.2. In determining the portion of a Tax
refund relating to a Pre-Closing Period, any refund of Taxes relating to a
Straddle Period shall be equitably apportioned between the portion of such
period ending on the Closing Date and the portion of such taxable period
beginning on the day after the Closing Date. Purchaser shall provide
reasonable cooperation to Sellers and Sellers' Affiliates at Sellers' expense
in order to take all necessary steps to claim any such refund. Purchaser
shall notify Sellers within ten (10) days following the discovery of a right
to claim any such refund and upon receipt of any such refund. Purchaser
agrees to claim any such refund as soon as possible after the discovery of a
right to claim a refund and to furnish to Sellers all information, records and
assistance necessary to verify the amount of the refund or overpayment at
Sellers' expense.

 

(b)Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Company and the Subsidiaries not
to, carry back any Tax Item of the Company or its subsidiaries arising in any
taxable period beginning at or after the Closing Date to a taxable year ending
before the Closing Date, except as required by applicable Law.

 

ARTICLE 9 
TERMINATION

 

9.1Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
Closing:

 

(a)by the mutual prior written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;

 

(b)by Sellers (collectively) or Purchaser if the Closing has not occurred on
or before September 16, 2015 (the "Closing End Date"); provided, however,
that, no Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement under Section
9.1(b) if the Closing has failed to occur because such Party failed to perform
or observe in any material respect its covenants and agreements hereunder or
such Party is in material breach of its representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement;

   

(c)by Sellers (collectively) or Purchaser, if the consummation of the Closing
would violate any nonappealable final order, decree or judgment of any
Governmental Authority having competent jurisdiction, subject, however, to
compliance by the terminating Party with the terms of Section 5.5;

 

(d)by Purchaser (if it is not in material breach of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement so as to cause any of
the conditions set forth in Article 6 not to be satisfied), upon written
notice to Sellers, if there has been a material violation, breach or
inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of either
Seller contained in this Agreement, which violation, breach or inaccuracy
would cause any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 not to be satisfied,
and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by Purchaser or
cured by the applicable Seller, as applicable, within 20 Business Days after
receipt by the applicable Seller of written notice thereof from Purchaser or
is not reasonably capable of being cured prior to the Closing End Date; or

 

(e)by Sellers (collectively) (if neither Seller is in material breach of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements under this Agreement so
as to cause any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 not to be satisfied),
upon written notice to Purchaser, if there has been a material violation,
breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of
Purchaser contained in this Agreement, which violation, breach or inaccuracy
would cause any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 not to be satisfied,
and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not been waived by Sellers or
cured by Purchaser, as applicable, within 20 Business Days after receipt by
Purchaser of written notice thereof from Sellers or is not reasonably capable
of being cured prior to the Closing End Date.

 

9.2Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.1, this Agreement shall become void and of no further force or effect
(except for the provisions of Sections 1.2, 3.21, 5.2, and 5.4, this Article
9, Article 11 and the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which shall continue
in full force and effect). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the termination of this Agreement under Section 9.1 shall not
relieve any Party from liability for any willful or negligent failure to
perform or observe in any material respect any of its agreements or covenants
contained herein that are to be performed or observed at or prior to Closing.

 

ARTICLE 10 
INDEMNIFICATION; LIMITATIONS

 

10.1Indemnification.

 

(a)From and after Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, defend, and hold
harmless Sellers and their Affiliates (other than the Company and the
Subsidiaries) and their respective officers, directors, managers, employees,
and agents (the "Seller Group") from and against all Damages incurred or
suffered by Seller Group and caused by, arising out of, relating to or
resulting from:

 

(i)Purchaser's breach of any of Purchaser's covenants or agreements contained
in Article 5, or

 

(ii)any breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser contained
in Article 4 of this Agreement or in the certificate delivered at Closing
pursuant to Section 7.3(d),

 

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEE, OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

 

(b)From and after Closing, Sellers [REDACTED]* shall indemnify, defend, and
hold harmless Purchaser and its Affiliates and its and their respective
officers, directors, managers, employees, and agents ("Purchaser Group") from
and against all Damages incurred or suffered by Purchaser Group and caused by,
arising out of, relating to or resulting from:

 

(i)a Seller's breach of its covenants or agreements contained in Article 5;

 

(ii)any breach of any Fundamental Representation [REDACTED]*;

 

(iii)any Transaction Expenses or Indebtedness of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries (except to the extent taken into account in the calculation of
the Purchase Price pursuant to Article 2 or otherwise paid at or prior to the
Closing);

 

(iv)the matters set forth on Schedule 3.6; or

   

(v)(A) any and all Taxes of Sellers (other than Transfer Taxes) or of the
Company or any Subsidiary to the extent attributable or related to any Pre-
Closing Period, (B) any and all Taxes of any member of an affiliated,
consolidated, combined or unitary group of which the Company or any Subsidiary
(or any predecessor) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date,
including pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any
corresponding or similar state, provincial, local, or non-U.S. Law or
regulation), and (C) any and all Taxes of any Person imposed on the Company or
any Subsidiary as a transferee or successor, by contract or pursuant to any
law, rule or regulation, which Taxes relate to an event or transaction before
the Closing Date and are appropriately attributable to a Pre-Closing Period,

 

EVEN IF SUCH DAMAGES ARE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE (WHETHER
SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL FAULT OF ANY
INDEMNIFIED PERSON, INVITEE, OR THIRD PERSON, AND WHETHER OR NOT CAUSED BY A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, other
than with respect to (i) claims for specific performance pursuant to Section
11.18, (ii) claims arising out of or relating to actual fraud or (iii) claims
pursuant to Article 8, Section 5.12, or Section 5.4, from and after Closing,
Sellers' and Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy against each other with
respect to breaches of the representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements of the Parties contained in Article 3, Article 4, and Article 5,
and the affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing
pursuant to Sections 7.2(f) and 7.3(d), as applicable, is set forth in this
Article 10, and if no such right or remedy is expressly provided, then such
claim is hereby waived to the fullest extent permitted by Law.

 

(d)The Parties shall treat, for Tax purposes, any amounts paid pursuant to
this Article 10 as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

10.2Indemnification Actions. All claims for indemnification under Section
10.1 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

 

(a)Promptly upon obtaining actual knowledge of a claim for indemnification
hereunder, any Party making a claim for indemnification under Section 10.1
(hereunder, an "Indemnitee") shall notify the indemnifying party
("Indemnitor") of such claim in writing (the "Notice of Claim"), describing
the claim, the amount thereof (if known and quantifiable), and the basis
thereof; provided, that the failure to so notify an Indemnitor shall not
relieve the Indemnitor of its obligations hereunder except to the extent that
such failure shall have adversely affected the Indemnitor\'s ability to defend
against, settle, mitigate or satisfy any Loss for which the Indemnitee is
entitled to indemnification hereunder.

 

(b)If the claim set forth in a Notice of Claim relates to a claim or demand
asserted by a third party, the Indemnitor shall have the right to elect (by
notice in writing to the Indemnitee within thirty (30) days after the date the
Notice of Claim is deemed delivered pursuant to Section 10.2(a)) to defend
such third party claim or demand with reputable counsel on behalf of the
Indemnitee, at the Indemnitor\'s sole cost and expense; provided, that prior
to the Indemnitor assuming control of such defense it shall first verify to
the Indemnitee in writing that such Indemnitor will fully indemnify the
Indemnitee with respect thereto. If the Indemnitor elects to defend such
third party claim or demand, the Indemnitee shall make available to the
Indemnitor and its agents and representatives as reasonably requested all
records and other materials that are reasonably required in the defense of
such third party claim or demand and shall otherwise reasonably cooperate with
and assist the Indemnitor in the defense of such third party claim or demand,
subject to the reimbursement of the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
the Indemnitee as a result of a request by the Indemnitor to so make available
records or other materials or so cooperate. So long as the Indemnitor is
defending such third party claim or demand in good faith, the Indemnitee shall
not pay, settle or compromise such third party claim or demand without the
consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) for an amount which is [REDACTED]* of the amount which
the Indemnitee seeks to recover from the Indemnitor; it being understood that
the Indemnitee may settle any third party claim or demand for an amount which
is [REDACTED]* of the amount which the Indemnitee seeks to recover from the
Indemnitor hereunder without the consent of the Indemnitor, in which case the
Indemnitee shall not be entitled to indemnification for any amounts in excess
of those amounts that the Indemnitee seeks to recover from the Indemnitor. If
the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any third party claim or demand,
the Indemnitor shall obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before admitting
any liability with respect to, consenting to the entry of any judgment, or
settling, compromising or discharging, such third party claim or demand if,
pursuant thereto or as a result thereof, injunctive or other equitable relief
shall be imposed against the Indemnitee or if such judgment, settlement,
compromise or discharge does not expressly and unconditionally release the
Indemnitee from all liabilities with respect to such third party claim or
demand, without prejudice. If the Indemnitor elects to defend such third
party claim or demand, the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in
the defense of such third party claim or demand, at its own expense, provided,
that if the Indemnitor does not elect to defend such third party claim or
demand, does not defend such third party claim in good faith or in a timely
manner, or if there are one or more legal defenses available to the Indemnitee
that conflict with those available to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall
have the right, in addition to any other right or remedy it may have
hereunder, at the Indemnitor\'s expense, to defend or participate in the
defense of such third party claim or demand. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnitor shall

   

not be entitled to assume control of the defense of any third party claim or
demand, and shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the
Indemnitee with respect thereto, if (A) such third party claim or demand
relates to or arises in connection with any Taxes (which are addressed in
Section 8.4) or criminal matters or (B) such third party claim or demand seeks
an injunction or equitable relief against the Indemnitee or its business
(including the Business).

 

(c)Except as otherwise provided in the following sentence with respect to
claims by the Company, any claim for indemnity under Section 10.1 by any
Affiliate, director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and
administered by the applicable Party to this Agreement. No Indemnified Person
other than a Seller and Purchaser, or, after Closing, the Company, shall have
any rights against a Seller or Purchaser under the terms of Section 10.1
except as may be exercised on its behalf by Purchaser or such Seller, as
applicable, pursuant to this Section 10.2(c). Each Seller and Purchaser may
elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this Section
10.2 on behalf of the other Indemnified Persons affiliated with it in its sole
discretion and shall have no liability to any such other Indemnified Person
for any action or inaction under this Section 10.2.

 

10.3Limitation on Actions.

 

(a)The representations and warranties of each Seller hereunder (and in the
certificates to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(f)), excluding the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.1 (Sellers), Section 3.2
(The Company), Section 3.3 (Subsidiaries), Section 3.4 (The Shares), Section
3.10(a) (Properties), and Section 3.12 (Liability for Broker's Fees) (the
"Fundamental Representations"), shall terminate and be of no further force and
effect as of the Closing Date. Without limiting the foregoing, and subject to
the further terms of this Section 10.3, the RandW Insurance shall be the sole
and exclusive recourse and remedy of Purchaser Group with respect to breaches
of the representations and warranties contained herein (and in the
certificates to be delivered pursuant to Section 7.2(f)) other than the
Fundamental Representations. The covenants and agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate or other writing delivered
pursuant hereto or in connection herewith shall survive the Closing until the
date that is [REDACTED]* following the Closing Date, except (a) for such
covenants and agreements that expressly survive for a longer period, which
shall survive the Closing for such longer period as expressly specified herein
or therein, (b) the Fundamental Representations, the representations and
warranties of Purchaser in Article 4 and the terms of Sections 10.1(b)(iv) and
(v) (including all rights of indemnification thereunder) shall survive the
Closing for a period of [REDACTED]* following the Closing Date, and (c) the
terms of Section 10.1(b)(iii) (including all rights of indemnification
thereunder) shall survive for a period of [REDACTED]* following the Closing
Date. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, (x) any breach of
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in respect of which indemnity
may be sought under this Agreement shall survive the time at which it would
otherwise terminate pursuant to the preceding sentence, if notice of the
inaccuracy or breach thereof giving rise to such right of indemnity shall have
been given to the Party against whom such indemnity may be sought prior to
such time, and (y) nothing contained in this Section 10.3(a) will limit, in
any way, any rights a Party may have to bring claims grounded in actual fraud.
The representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any writing
delivered by any Party to any other Party in connection with this Agreement
shall survive for the periods set forth in this Section 10.3(a) and shall in
no event be affected by any investigation, inquiry or examination made for or
on behalf of the Parties, or the knowledge of any of the Parties\' officers,
directors, shareholders, employees or agents or the acceptance by the Parties
of any certificate or opinion hereunder. Sellers shall be severally, and not
jointly liable under Section 10.1(b)(ii) with respect to breaches of the
Fundamental Representations in Section 3.1 and the covenants and agreements
set forth in Section 5.2 and 5.12.

 

(b)Without limiting the foregoing, the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole
recourse for any Damages to which a member of the Purchaser Group is entitled
with respect to breaches of the representations and warranties set forth in
Article 3 (other than with respect to Damages for any breaches or inaccuracies
of any of the Fundamental Representations or based on actual fraud). With
respect to Damages to which Purchaser Group is entitled pursuant to Section
10.1(b), Purchaser may seek recourse for such Damages from Sellers directly
pursuant to this Article 10.

 

(c)The amount of any Damages for which an Indemnitee is entitled to indemnity
under this Article 10 shall be reduced by the amount of insurance proceeds
actually received by the Indemnitee or its Affiliates with respect to such
Damages (net of any collection costs, deductibles, and increases in premiums);
provided, however, that no Party shall be required to seek recovery under any
policy of insurance as a condition to indemnification hereunder.

 

(d)As used in this Agreement, the term "Damages" means the amount of any
liability, loss, cost, expense, claim, award, or judgment incurred or suffered
by any Person, whether attributable to personal injury or death, property
damage, contract claims, torts, or otherwise, including reasonable fees and
expenses of attorneys, consultants, accountants, or other agents and experts,
and the costs of investigation and/or monitoring of such matters, and the
costs of enforcement of the indemnity.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i)
the limitations, thresholds, qualifications and similar provisions set forth
in this Article 10 shall not apply in the event of or with respect to actual
fraud, and (ii) no Indemnified Person shall be required to show that it relied
on any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation of Sellers in order to
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article 10.

11.3Sales or Use Tax, Recording Fees and Similar Taxes and Fees.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article 8, Purchaser (on the one
hand) and Sellers (on the other hand) shall each bear one-half of any sales,
use, excise, real property transfer or gain, gross receipts, goods and
services, registration, capital, documentary, stamp or transfer Taxes,
recording fees, and similar Taxes and fees incurred and imposed upon, or with
respect to, the property transfers or other transactions contemplated hereby
("Transfer Taxes"). Should any Seller, the Company, or any Affiliate of any
of them pay prior to Closing, or should any Seller or any continuing Affiliate
of any Seller pay after Closing, any amount for which Purchaser is liable
under this Section 11.3, Purchaser shall, promptly following receipt of such
Seller's invoice, describing the amount in reasonable detail, reimburse the
amount paid.

 

11.4Expenses. Except as provided in Section 5.5, all expenses incurred by
Sellers in connection with or related to the authorization, preparation or
execution of this Agreement, and the Exhibits and Schedules hereto and
thereto, and all other matters related to the Closing, including all fees and
expenses of counsel, accountants, and financial advisers employed by Sellers,
shall be borne solely and entirely by Sellers, and all such expenses incurred
by Purchaser shall be borne solely and entirely by Purchaser.

 

11.5Records. As soon as practicable, but in no event later than sixty (60)
days after the Closing Date, Sellers shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
Purchaser or the Company any original records of the Company that are in the
possession of Sellers or its remaining Affiliates.

 

11.6Governing Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the Parties
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to principles of conflicts of Laws that would direct
the application of the Laws of another jurisdiction.

 

11.7Dispute Resolution. Each Party consents to personal jurisdiction in any
action brought in the United States federal or state courts located in the
State of Delaware with respect to any dispute, claim, or controversy arising
out of, in relation to, or in connection with, this Agreement, and each of the
Parties agrees that any action instituted by it against the other with respect
to any such dispute, controversy, or claim (except to the extent a dispute,
controversy, or claim arising out of, in relation to, or in connection with,
the determination of Purchase Price adjustments pursuant to Section 2.3 is
referred to an expert pursuant to those Sections) will be instituted
exclusively in such courts. Each Party (a) irrevocably submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts; (b) waives any objection to laying
venue in any such action or proceeding in such courts; (c) waives any
objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have
jurisdiction over it; and (d) agrees that service of process upon it may be
effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered mail (or any substantially
similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to it at its address specified in
Section 11.2. The foregoing consents to jurisdiction and service of process
shall not constitute general consents to service of process in the State of
Texas for any purpose except as provided herein and shall not be deemed to
confer any rights on any Person other than the Parties to this Agreement. The
Parties hereby waive trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim
brought by any Party against another in any matter whatsoever arising out of,
in relation to, or in connection with, this Agreement.

 

11.8Captions. The captions in this Agreement are for convenience only and
shall not be considered a part of or affect the construction or interpretation
of any provision of this Agreement.

 

11.9Waivers. Any failure by any Party to comply with any of its obligations,
agreements, or conditions herein contained may be waived by the Party to whom
such compliance is owed by an instrument signed by the Party to whom
compliance is owed and expressly identified as a waiver, but not in any other
manner. No waiver of, or consent to a change in, any of the provisions of
this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of, or consent to
a change in, other provisions hereof (whether or not similar), nor shall such
waiver constitute a continuing waiver unless otherwise expressly provided. No
failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege.

 

11.10Assignment. No Party shall assign (including by change of control,
merger, consolidation, or stock purchase) or otherwise transfer all or any
part of this Agreement to any third Person, nor shall any Party delegate any
of its rights or duties hereunder (including by change of control, merger,
consolidation, or stock purchase) to any third Person, without the prior
written consent of the other Party and any transfer or delegation made without
such consent shall be void; provided, however, that at any time prior to the
Closing Date, Purchaser may, without the prior written consent of Sellers,
assign all or any portion of its rights (but not its obligations) under this
Agreement relating to the purchase of the Shares to one or more of its
Affiliates. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon,
and inure to the benefit of, the Parties and their respective successors and
assigns.

 

11.11Entire Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement, this Agreement, and the
documents to be executed hereunder and the Exhibits and Schedules attached
hereto constitute the entire agreement among the Parties pertaining to the
subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior agreements, understandings,
negotiations, and discussions, whether oral or written, of the Parties
pertaining to the subject matter hereof.

   

11.12Amendment. This Agreement may be amended or modified only by an
agreement in writing signed by Sellers and Purchaser and expressly identified
as an amendment or modification.

 

11.13No Third-Person Beneficiaries. Nothing in this Agreement shall entitle
any Person other than Purchaser and Sellers to any claim, cause of action,
remedy or right of any kind, except the rights expressly provided to the
Persons described in Section 5.4 and Section 10.2(c).

 

11.14Severability. If any provision of this Agreement, or any application
thereof, is held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect under any
Law, this Agreement shall be reformed to the extent necessary to conform, in
each case consistent with the intention of the Parties, to such Law, and, to
the extent such provision cannot be so reformed, then such provision (or the
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable application thereof) shall be deemed
deleted from (or prohibited under) this Agreement, as the case may be, and the
validity, legality, and enforceability of the remaining provisions contained
herein (and any other application of such provision) shall not in any way be
affected or impaired thereby.

 

11.15Time of the Essence. Time is of the essence in this Agreement. If the
date specified in this Agreement for giving any notice or taking any action is
not a Business Day (or if the period during which any notice is required to be
given or any action taken expires on a date which is not a Business Day), then
the date for giving such notice or taking such action (and the expiration of
such period during which notice is required to be given or action taken) shall
be the next day which is a Business Day.

 

11.16References. In this Agreement, unless the context requires otherwise:
(a) references to any gender includes a reference to all other genders; (b)
references to the singular includes the plural, and vice versa; (c) reference
to any Article or Section means an Article or Section of this Agreement; (d)
reference to any Exhibit or Schedule means an Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement, all of which are incorporated into, and made a part of, this
Agreement; (e) unless expressly provided to the contrary, "hereunder",
"hereof", "herein", and words of similar import are references to this
Agreement as a whole and not any particular Section or other provision of this
Agreement; (f) references to "$" or "Dollars" means United States Dollars; (g)
"include" and "including" mean include or including without limiting the
generality of the description preceding such term; (h) "made available" means
that Purchaser, its Affiliates, or representatives have had the opportunity,
prior to the date hereof, to review the relevant documents or referenced
matters or materials at the offices of Sellers or its Affiliates or
representatives or electronically by virtue of the Data Room.

 

11.17Construction. Purchaser is capable of making such investigation,
inspection, review and evaluation of the Shares, the Company, the
Subsidiaries, and the Business as a prudent purchaser would deem appropriate
under the circumstances, including with respect to all matters relating to the
Business, its value, operation, and suitability. Sellers and Purchaser have
had the opportunity to exercise business discretion in relation to the
negotiation of the details of the transaction contemplated hereby. This
Agreement is the result of arm's-length negotiations from equal bargaining
positions. It is expressly agreed that this Agreement shall not be construed
against any Party, and no consideration shall be given or presumption made, on
the basis of who drafted this Agreement or any particular provision hereof.

 

11.18Specific Performance. The Parties agree that, other than (a) breaches of
Sellers' representations and warranties in Article 3 (other than the
Fundamental Representations), Purchaser's sole and exclusive remedy for which
shall be the condition precedent to Closing as set forth in Section 6.2(a) and
the RandW Insurance Policy, as set forth in Section 10.1(c) and 10.3(b), and (b)
as set forth in Section 10.1(c), irreparable damage would occur if any
provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms
hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof in the courts specified in
Section 11.7, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at
law or in equity. The pursuit of specific enforcement by either Party will
not be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any
other right or remedy (whether at law or in equity) to which such Party may be
entitled (including monetary damages) hereunder.
