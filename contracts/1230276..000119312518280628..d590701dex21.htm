Common Stock payable in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ (together with
the shares of Parent Common Stock deposited pursuant to clause (i) above, the

(c) The cash portion of the Exchange Fund may be invested by the Exchange
Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or loss

all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Exchange Agent
hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit into the Exchange Fund the amount of

Consideration: (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a
form and have such customary provisions as Parent and the Company may
reasonably agree prior to the Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

 

(ii) Any holder of a Certificate shall be entitled to receive, upon surrender

__ _ 2.4_, the aggregate Merger Consideration for the shares of New Company
Common Stock that the Company Common Stock previously represented by such
Certificate was converted into pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_, (B)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.4_ and (C) any dividends or other
distributions in respect of such whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock

Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. 

(e) _Exchange Procedures for Book-Entry Shares_. Any holder of Book-Entry
Shares shall not be required to deliver a Certificate, executed letter of
transmittal or other documents in order to receive the Merger Consideration
that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of such Book-Entry Shares
(unless the Exchange Agent reasonably requires a letter of transmittal
or other documents). The Exchange Agent shall pay and deliver to any such
holder of Book-Entry Shares as promptly as practicable after the Effective

reasonably required, if any): (A) subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.4_, the

the Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares was
converted into pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_, (B) cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable in accordance with _Section_

shall forthwith be cancelled.

(f) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. Until a holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares surrenders such Certificate or exchanges such
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_ , no dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock that the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares is entitled to receive shall be paid to such
holder. Upon such holder surrendering such Certificate or exchanging such
Book-Entry Shares in accordance with this _Article II_ , such holder shall be
entitled to receive any dividends or other distributions with respect to such
shares of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time and
payment date prior to the time such Certificate was surrendered or such Book-
Entry Shares exchanged.

of its claim for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Article
II_.

 

(h) _Escheatment_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Company or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash payable pursuant to this Agreement delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any
Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of New Holding
Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would

Surviving Company free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.4. _Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares (or scrip representing
fractional shares) of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in connection with
the Merger. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder
of shares of New Holding Company Common Stock who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
aggregating all shares of Parent Common Stock that the holder of such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares is entitled to receive in respect of such
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares surrendered or exchanged by such holder)
shall receive, in lieu of such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock,
cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (i) such
fraction of a share (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in
decimal form) by (ii) the Parent Measurement Price. No such holder shall be
entitled to dividends, distributions, voting rights or any other rights in
respect of any fractional share of Parent Common Stock.

 

Section 2.5. _Certificates in Another Person_ __ _s Name_. Any Person
surrendering a Certificate that is not issued in the name of such Person

_Section_ __ _ 2.3_ for the shares of New Holding Company Common Stock that
the Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate was
converted into pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ if (a) such Certificate
is properly endorsed (or Parent and the Exchange Agent are otherwise satisfied
that such Person has properly transferred such Certificate), (b) the Person
surrendering such Certificate pays any required transfer or other Taxes (or
establishes to the satisfaction of Parent or the Exchange Agent that such Tax
has been paid or is not applicable) and (c) such Person has otherwise
complied with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

Section 2.6. _Lost Certificates_. Any Person claiming that a Certificate has
been lost, stolen or destroyed shall only be entitled to receive the Merger

Holding Company Common Stock that the Company Common Stock previously

9

    

  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)_ if such Person (a) provides an affidavit
(reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Exchange Agent) that such Certificate
has been lost, stolen or destroyed, (b) posts a bond (in such reasonable
amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may direct) as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Parent, the Exchange Agent or the Surviving
Corporation with respect to such Certificate and (c) has otherwise complied
with _Section_ __ _ 2.3_.

Section 2.7. _No Further Transfers_. After the Holding Company Merger
Effective Time, (i) there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the New
Holding Company of shares of New Holding Company Common Stock that are issued
in connection with the Holding Company Merger. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason,
they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article II_.

 

Section 2.8. _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_. At the
Holding Company Merger Effective Time, the Company Stock Options, the Company
RSUs and the Company Performance Awards outstanding as of immediately prior
thereto shall be adjusted to give effect to the conversion of shares of
Company Common Stock as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.1_.

 

(a) _Stock Options_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Company Common
Stock granted under a Company Stock Incentive Plan that, as adjusted into an
option to acquire New Holding Company Common Stock, is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) (each, a
" _Company Stock Option_ ") shall, without any further action on the part of
any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into an option to purchase from
Parent, a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of New
Holding Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio, at an
exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest
whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (1) the per share
exercise price for the shares of New Holding Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Stock Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (2)
the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, a " _Converted Parent Option_ ").

(ii) Each Converted Parent Option shall have the same vesting schedule
(including any potential acceleration of vesting as provided in the applicable
Company Stock Incentive Plan, grant agreement under which the Company Option
was originally granted or any applicable offer letter, employment
agreement, severance agreement or severance plan or policy of the Company or
a Company Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on
_Section_ __ _ 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or granted in
compliance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.1(k)(D)_) and post-termination exercise
period as the Company Stock Option as in effect as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time and shall be subject to all of the material terms and
conditions of the 

 



10

    

 Company Stock Incentive Plan under which the Company Stock Option was
originally granted, to the extent administratively practicable; provided, that
Parent shall convert Company Stock Options into Converted Parent Options in a
manner intended to not cause the Converted Parent Options to be treated as the
grant of a new stock right for purposes of Section 409A of the Code.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Company Stock Option that is (x)
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) has an
exercise price per share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration Closing Value, shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time
without payment therefor and shall have no further force or effect.

(b) _Restricted Stock Units_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, each right to receive one share of Company Common
Stock granted under a Company Stock Incentive Plan in the form of "stock
units" that, as adjusted into a right to receive New Holding Company Common
Stock, is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") shall, without any further action on the
part of any holder thereof, be assumed and converted into the right to receive
a number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) determined by multiplying (x) the number of shares of New Holding
Company Common Stock subject to such Company RSU as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time by (y) the Exchange Ratio (each, as so adjusted, a "
_Converted Parent RSU_ ").

 

(ii) Each Converted Parent RSU shall have the same vesting schedule (including
any potential acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Stock
Incentive Plan, grant agreement under which the Company RSU was originally
granted or any applicable offer letter, employment agreement, severance
agreement or severance plan or policy of the Company or a Company Subsidiary
as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on _Section_ __ _
3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or granted in compliance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.1(k)(D)_) and settlement date as the Company RSU and shall
be subject to all of the material terms and conditions of the Company Stock
Incentive Plan under which the Company RSU was originally granted, to the
extent administratively practicable.

 

(c) _Performance Awards_.

 

(i) At the Effective Time, if the Merger Consideration Closing Value equals or
exceeds $20.00 then, each right to receive one share of Company Common Stock
granted under a Company Stock Incentive Plan in the form of "performance
awards" that, as adjusted into a right to receive New Holding Company Common
Stock, is outstanding and unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time (each, a " _Company Performance Award_ ") shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, (x) be converted into a time-vesting
award, in accordance with the terms of the applicable grant agreement, which
will vest in accordance with the vesting schedule set forth in the applicable
grant agreement and (y) be assumed and converted into the right to receive a
number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole
share) determined by multiplying (A) the number of shares of

 



11

    

 New Holding Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Award
as of immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Exchange Ratio (each,
as so adjusted, a " _Converted Parent Performance Award_ "). Each Converted
Parent Performance Award shall have the same time-vesting schedule (including
any potential acceleration of vesting as provided in the Company Stock
Incentive Plan, grant agreement under which the Company Performance Award was
originally granted or any applicable offer letter, employment agreement,
severance agreement or severance plan or policy of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary as in effect on the date of this Agreement and listed on 
_Section_ __ _ 3.11(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or granted in
compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.1(k)(D)_) and settlement date as the Company
Performance Award and shall be subject to all of the material terms and
conditions of the Company Stock Incentive Plan under which the Company RSU was
originally granted, to the extent administratively practicable.

 

(ii) At the Effective Time, if the Merger Consideration Closing Value is less
than $20.00 then, each Company Performance Award shall, without any further
action on the part of any holder thereof, in accordance with the terms of the
applicable grant agreement, be cancelled by the Company and forfeited.

 

(d) _ESPP_. The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)_ shall not apply to any
rights under the Companys 2014 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_
"). With respect to the ESPP, as soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board (or a committee thereof) will adopt
resolutions or take other actions as may be required to provide that no
further Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) or Purchase Period (as
defined in the ESPP) will commence pursuant to the ESPP after the date hereof.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take all action that may be
necessary to, effective upon the consummation of the Merger: (A) cause any
Purchase Period that would otherwise be outstanding at the Effective Time, if
any, to be terminated no later than one Business Day prior to the date on
which the Effective Time occurs; (B) make any pro rata adjustments that may
be necessary to reflect the shortened Offering Period, but otherwise treat
such shortened Offering Period as a fully effective and completed Purchase
Period for all purposes pursuant to the ESPP; and (C) cause the exercise (as
of no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the date on which the Effective
Time occurs) of each outstanding purchase right pursuant to the ESPP. On such
exercise date, if any, referred to in clause (C) of the preceding sentence,
the Company will apply the funds credited as of such date pursuant to the ESPP
within each participants payroll withholding account to the purchase of whole
shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the ESPP and
will cause the remaining accumulated but unused payroll deductions to be
distributed to the relevant participants without interest as promptly as
practicable following such exercise date. Immediately prior to and effective
as of the Holding Company Merger Effective Time (but subject to the
consummation of the Holding Company Merger), the Company will terminate the
ESPP.

 

(e) _Registration of Converted Awards_. Not later than the Closing Date,
Parent shall have on file with the SEC a registration statement on an
appropriate form, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement
previously filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the shares of
Parent Common Stock subject to the Converted Parent Options, 

 



12

    

 Converted Parent RSUs and, to the extent applicable, Converted Parent
Performance Awards and shall distribute a prospectus relating to such
registration statement, and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to
maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement or registration
statements (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
contained therein) for so long as Converted Parent Options, Converted Parent
RSUs and, to the extent applicable, Converted Parent Performance Awards
remain outstanding.

(f) _Further Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Company
Board and the compensation committee of the Company Board, as applicable, will
adopt any resolutions and take any actions with respect to the Company Stock
Incentive Plans and the award agreements thereunder as are reasonably
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this _Section_ __
_ 2.8_, including (i) providing notice to each holder of a Company Option,
Company RSU and/or Company Performance Award in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent of the treatment of the Company Options, Company RSUs and/or Company
Performance Awards set forth in this Agreement; and (ii) satisfying all
applicable requirements of Rule 16b-3(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
The Company will provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment upon (and the Companys acceptance of
Parents reasonable comments shall not be unreasonably withheld), all
notices, resolutions and other written actions or communications as may be
required to give effect to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 2.8_.

 

Section 2.9. _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number or class of
shares by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), recapitalization or other similar transaction, or a
stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date following the
date hereof and on or prior to the Closing Date, then the Exchange Ratio and
any other similarly dependent items in this Agreement, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.9_ shall be construed to
permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited or
restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

Section 2.10. _Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent, the Surviving Company and the Exchange Agent (and any
Affiliate thereof or any other withholding agent) shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement (including
to any holder of New Holding Company Common Stock), such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or under any provision of state, local or foreign
Law relating to Taxes. Any amount so deducted or withheld and duly paid over
to the applicable Tax authority shall be treated as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

opportunity to review and to comment on such response and shall take into
account in good faith any such comments as reasonably proposed) and to have
any such stop order or suspension lifted, reversed or otherwise terminated.

 



42

    

(d) No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by
Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
will be made by the Company, in each case without providing the other Party
with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement, so that either
such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be

beginning on the No-Shop Period Start Date and prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, if the Company or any of its Representatives receives an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Company Acquisition Proposal that did not

 Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Company Superior Proposal,
the Company and its Representatives may (i) participate or engage in
discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives regarding
such Company Acquisition Proposal and (ii) furnish information to the Person
making such Company Acquisition Proposal which is reasonably requested by such
Person in connection with such Company Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that
(A) prior to participating or engaging in such discussions or negotiations or
furnishing such information, the Company shall have entered into an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement with such Person and (B) the Company will provide
to Parent any information relating to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
prior to or concurrently with the time it is furnished to such Person making
such Company Acquisition Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding
the commencement of the No-Shop Period Start Date, prior to obtaining the
Company Stockholder Approval, the Company is permitted to engage in the
activities described in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ with respect to any
Excluded Party, subject to the proviso in the previous sentence, unless such
Excluded Party ceases to be an Excluded Party in accordance with the
definition thereof.

(e) From and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company will notify
Parent orally and in writing promptly (and in any event within one Business
Day) (i) after receipt of any Company Acquisition Proposal or any request for
non-public information or to engage in discussions or negotiations that could
reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Acquisition Proposal), which
notice shall include the material terms and conditions of such Company
Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the Person making any such Company
Acquisition Proposal and copies of drafts of proposed agreements, commitment
letters, term sheets or letters of intent related thereto (including any cover
letter with respect thereto) that are exchanged between such Person and
the Company (such materials, the " _Proposal Documents_ ") and (ii) of any
change to the financial or other material terms and conditions of any Company
Acquisition Proposal (including any Company Acquisition Proposal from an
Excluded Party). The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis of material changes in the status of any such Company
Acquisition Proposal (including from an Excluded Party), including by
providing Parent with copies of all Proposal Documents promptly (and in any
event within one Business Day) upon receipt by the Company of such written
documents or upon delivery by the Company, the Company Board or their counsel
of such written documents to such Person making such Company Acquisition
Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the No-Shop Period
Start Date, the Company will notify Parent orally and in writing promptly (and
in any event within one Business Day) after receipt of any request for non-
public information relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or for
access to any properties, books or records by any Person (including from an
Excluded Party) in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal and shall
in no event begin providing such information or access prior to providing such
notice.

 

(f) Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 5.5(g)_, neither the Company nor the
Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall, directly or indirectly, (i)
fail to make or withdraw (or modify or qualify in any manner adverse to Parent
or publicly propose to withdraw, modify or qualify in any manner adverse to
Parent) the Company Recommendation or (ii) adopt, approve, or publicly
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable the adoption of any Company
Acquisition Proposal (each such action being referred to herein as an "
_Change of Recommendation_ ").

 



45

    

(g) At any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (whether
before or after the No-Shop Period Start Date), and only following compliance
with the other provisions in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Company Board may
terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ (and
effect a Change of Recommendation with respect thereto), if:

(i) the Company received a bona fide written Company Acquisition Proposal
(including a Company Acquisition Proposal from an Excluded Party) after the
date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ __
_ 5.5_ that the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors)
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal;

 

(ii) the Company shall have provided Parent with written notice (" _Superior
Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent it intends to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_, which notice shall include the material
terms and conditions of such Company Acquisition Proposal, the identity of the
Person making any such Company Acquisition Proposal and copies of all written
agreements, or, if not final, the most recent draft thereof, reflecting such
Company Acquisition Proposal (including drafts (or final versions) of any
agreements, commitment letters, term sheets or letters of intent related
thereto (including any cover letter with respect thereto));

(iii) for at least a three (3) Business Day period commencing on the Business
Day following the date Parent receives the Superior Proposal Notice (the "
_Company Negotiation Period_ "), the Company has negotiated, and has caused
its financial and legal advisors (and other Representatives) to negotiate,
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) changes
to the terms of this Agreement such that the Company Acquisition Proposal
would no longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal (it being understood
that any revisions to the financial terms (including to the amount or form of
consideration) or other material terms of the Company Acquisition Proposal
shall require the Company to comply again with the procedures set forth in
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(g)_, including providing a new Superior Proposal
Notice and a new Company Negotiation Period, which period shall be shortened
to two (2) Business Days, with respect thereto); and

 

(iv) following 11:59 p.m., New York City time, on the last Business Day of the
applicable Company Negotiation Period(s) referred to in clause (iii) above,
the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors) that such Company Acquisition
Proposal still constitutes a Company Superior Proposal after giving effect to
all of the changes to this Agreement which have been proposed by Parent.

(h) At any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval (whether
before or after the No-Shop Period Start Date), the Company Board may effect a
Change of Recommendation if:

 



46

    

(i) there shall occur or arise after the date of this Agreement a
material development or material change in circumstances (or if such material
development or material change in circumstances occurred or arose on or prior
to the date of this Agreement, the material consequences of which are not
known to the Company Board as of the date of this Agreement and only become
known to the Company Board prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval), in each case, that was not reasonably foreseeable and that relates
to the Company or the Company Subsidiaries but does not relate to any Company
Acquisition Proposal (as to which _Section_ __ _ 5.5(g)_ shall apply) (any
such material development or material change in circumstances unrelated to an
Company Acquisition Proposal being referred to as an " _Intervening Event_
"); provided, however, that in no event shall (A) any action taken by the
Company in order to comply with the covenants set forth in this Agreement, and
the consequences of any such action, constitute an Intervening Event and (B)
any changes in the market price or trading volume of shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock constitute an Intervening Event;

 

(ii) the Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with the
Companys outside legal and financial advisors) that, in light of such
Intervening Event, the failure to withdraw or modify the Company
Recommendation in a manner adverse to Parent would be inconsistent with the
Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law;

(iii) the Company shall have provided Parent with written notice (an "
_Intervening Event Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company Board intends
to make a Change of Recommendation, which notice shall describe in reasonable
detail the Intervening Event (it being agreed that the delivery of such
notice by the Company shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation);

(iv) for at least a three (3) Business Day period commencing on the Business
Day following the date Parent receives the Intervening Event Notice, the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its financial and legal advisors (and
other Representatives) to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that the need for making such Change of
Recommendation would be obviated; and

 

(v) at the end of the period referred to in clause (iv) above, after taking
into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement offered by Parent in
writing to the Company, the Company Board has determined in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors) that the
failure to withdraw or modify the Company Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law in light of such Intervening Event.

 

(i) Nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ will prohibit the Company
or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under
applicable Law with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal, including
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 under the

 



47

    

 Exchange Act or making a statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of
Regulation M-A (or any similar communication to stockholders) or (ii) making
a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication to stockholders of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act; _provided_ that (x)
this paragraph shall in no way eliminate or modify the effect that any such
action taken or disclosure made would otherwise have under this Agreement, (y)
any such action taken or disclosure made that relates to a Company Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation unless the Company
Board reaffirms the Company Recommendation in connection with such action or
disclosure and (z) in no event shall the Company or the Company Board make a
Change of Recommendation except in compliance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(f)_.

Section 5.6. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company shall use their reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or advisable to (i)
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions
set forth in _Article VI_ to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in
any event prior to the Outside Date); (ii) prepare as promptly as practicable
all necessary applications, notices, filings, requests and other documents to
be made or filed by such Party (and cooperate with the other Parties with
respect to any applications, notices, filings, requests and other documents
to be made or filed by the other Parties) in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) obtain as promptly as practicable all
consents, approvals, clearances, permits, authorizations, registrations,
filings or notices from any Governmental Entity (or other Person) which is
required to be obtained in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; (iv) comply promptly with all requirements under applicable
Law which may be imposed on such Party with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; (v) defend all lawsuits or other Proceedings
to which it (or with respect to the Company, the Company Subsidiaries is) a
party challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance
of a final, non-appealable order with respect to each such lawsuit or other
Proceeding; (vi) have lifted or rescinded any injunction or restraining Order
which may adversely affect the ability of the Parties to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case until the issuance
of a final, non-appealable Order with respect thereto and (vii) resolve any
objection or assertion by any Governmental Entity challenging this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agree
to, as promptly as practicable after the date hereof: (i) make (or cause to
be made) an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to
the HSR Act, which filing shall in any event be made within twenty (20)
Business Days following the date hereof, and (ii) make such filings and
submissions contemplated by applicable foreign Competition Laws as set forth
on _Section_ __ _ 5.6(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(c) Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including those set
forth elsewhere in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_, each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, shall (i) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, promptly inform the other Party of any
substantive communication (oral and written) received by such 

 



48

    

 party from, or given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity with respect
to any applications, notices, filings or requests made (or any consents,
approvals or clearances sought to be obtained) in connection with the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement (including keeping the other
Parties apprised, on a current basis of the status thereof); (ii) to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, promptly inform the other Party of
any substantive communication (oral and written) received by such Party from,
or given by such Party to, any Person that is not a Governmental Entity in
connection with any Proceeding (or threatened Proceeding) by such Person
regarding or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; (iii) consult with the other Parties (subject to applicable
Law relating to the exchange of information) in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party relating to any
applications, notices, filings or requests made (or any consents, approvals or
clearances sought to be obtained) in connection with the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement; (iv) use reasonable best efforts to furnish to
the other Party and, upon request, to any Governmental Entities such
information and assistance as may be reasonably requested in connection with
the foregoing, including by responding promptly to and using reasonable best
efforts to comply fully with any request for additional information or
documents under any applicable Law; and (v) not independently participate in
any meeting (including telephonic meetings) with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the foregoing without giving the other Party sufficient prior
notice of the meeting (including telephonic meetings) and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or
participate in such meeting (including telephonic meetings). Notwithstanding
anything in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_ to the contrary, materials provided by
or on behalf of Parent to the Company or its counsel or the Company to Parent
or its counsel may be redacted to the extent necessary (a) to remove
references concerning Parents or the Companys valuation analyses with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, (b) as necessary to
comply with Contracts in effect on the date hereof, (c) to address reasonable
concerns regarding attorney-client privilege or (d) to remove personal,
proprietary and other confidential business information. Neither Parent nor
the Company shall acquire, or agree to acquire, any business, entity or
undertaking, where that acquisition, if completed, will or is reasonably
likely to have a materially adverse effect on the prospects of obtaining any
regulatory approval to be sought in relation to the Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (i) in no
case shall the Company, Parent or Merger Sub be obligated to (and the Company
shall not, without the written consent of Parent, and in no event shall Parent
or Merger Sub be deemed to have breached any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement for refusing to) become subject to, consent to or agree
to, or otherwise take any action with respect to, any requirement, condition,
understanding, agreement or order to sell, to hold separate or otherwise
dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its
respective assets or business (including those of its respective Affiliates
(but for the avoidance of doubt excluding any Specified Persons, as to whom no
such requirements, conditions, understandings, agreements or order shall
apply in any event)) in any manner that, either individually or in the
aggregate, (A) materially adversely affects the financial condition, business,
or the operations of (x) the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, on
a consolidated basis, or (y) Parent and its Affiliates or (B) prohibits or
materially limits the ownership, control or operation by (x) the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries or (y) Parent and its Affiliates of any
material portion of its or their respective businesses or assets, or compels
the Company or Parent or any of its Affiliates to dispose of or hold separate
any of its material businesses or assets or any portion thereof.

 



49

    

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries and the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required (and without the
prior consent of Parent, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries shall not)
to take any action with respect to any order or any applicable Law or in order
to obtain any approval, consent or clearance which is not conditioned upon
the consummation of the Merger.

(f) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this _Section_
__ _ 5.6_ but subject in all respects to _Section_ __ _ 5.6(d)_, each Party
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents or
approvals from any Persons (other than Governmental Entities) that are
necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In the event that the Parties hereto shall fail to obtain any
such third party consent, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts,
and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize
any adverse effect upon the Company and the Company Subsidiaries resulting, or
which would reasonably be expected to result, after the Effective Time,
from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any such approval or
consent with respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i)
none of the Company or any Company Subsidiary shall be required to, or,
without the prior written consent of Parent, shall, pay or commit to pay to
such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other
consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation
due to such person and (ii) none of Parent, Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation.

Section 5.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each Party shall give
reasonably prompt written notice to the other Party, if to such Partys
Knowledge, (a) any representation or warranty made by it contained in this
Agreement becomes untrue or inaccurate such that it would be reasonable to
expect that the applicable closing conditions would be incapable of being
satisfied by the Outside Date or (b) it fails to comply with or satisfy in any
material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it under this Agreement; _provided_ that (i) nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall be deemed to affect, modify or condition the
obligations of each party to effect the Closing and (ii) each Partys
obligations, actions or inactions pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ shall
be deemed excluded for purposes of determining whether the conditions set
forth in either _Section_ __ _ 6.2_ or  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ have been
satisfied.

Section 5.8. _Publicity_. Except with respect to any Change of Recommendation
made by the Company in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, so long as this
Agreement is in effect, each of Parent and the Company shall consult with each
other before issuing any press release or public statement with respect to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement
without the prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned) of the other Party; _provided_ that a Party may, without
obtaining the prior consent of the other party (but after prior consultation,
to the extent practicable in the circumstances), issue such press release or
make such public statement as may upon the advice of outside counsel be
required by

 



50

    

 applicable Law or the rules and regulations of Nasdaq or NYSE, as
applicable. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable efforts to cooperate to develop all public announcement materials
and make appropriate management available at presentations related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as reasonably requested by the
other Party, and the Company shall consult with Parent
regarding communications with customers, stockholders and employees related
to the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.9.  _Indemnification_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Company
to indemnify, defend and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date of this Agreement and as permitted under applicable Law, all past and
present directors and officers of the Company and any Company Subsidiary
(each, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators, a "
_Company Indemnified Party_ ") against any liabilities, damages, costs or
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with any Proceeding (whether asserted before or after the Effective
Time) arising out of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time in connection with such Company Indemnified Party having served as a
director or officer of the Company or a Company Subsidiary or having served at
the request of the Company or a Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or
employee of any other corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
joint venture, employee benefit plan, trust or other business (and including
any acts or omissions with respect to this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby), and, to the same extent that such
Company Indemnified Parties have the right to advancement of expenses from
the Company or a Company Subsidiary as of the date of this Agreement, to
provide advancement of expenses to any such Company Indemnified Party, subject
to receipt of an undertaking from such Company Indemnified Party to repay
such advanced amounts if it is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
in a final judgment that such Company Indemnified Person was not entitled to
indemnification. Such rights set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(a)_ shall
continue in full force and effect until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to any such Proceedings against any
Company Indemnified Party, except as otherwise required by applicable Law,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Company (or any successor) to include and
maintain in effect, for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time,
the provisions regarding elimination of liability of directors that are in
the Companys certificate of incorporation as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement.

(b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain or cause the Surviving Company to maintain for the benefit of each
Company Indemnified Party a directors and officers liability insurance
policy that provides coverage for acts or omissions occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") with terms and conditions which are,
in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such Company Indemnified Party than
the terms and conditions of the existing directors and officers liability
insurance policy of the Company; _provided_ that, at Parents option, in lieu
of the foregoing insurance coverage, Parent or, with Parents consent, the
Company may at or prior to the Effective Time substitute therefor a single
premium tail coverage with respect to the DandO Insurance that provides coverage
for period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, with terms and
conditions 

 



51

    

 which are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to such Company
Indemnified Party than (and otherwise comparable to) the terms and conditions
of the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the
Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will Parent be required to
expend (and in no event shall the Company expend), in the aggregate, an amount
in excess of 300% of the most recent annual premium paid by the Company for
the existing directors and officers liability insurance policy of the
Company (the " _Insurance Amount_ "), and if Parent is unable to maintain or
obtain the insurance called for by this  _Section_ __ _ 5.9(b)_ for an
amount equal to or less than the Insurance Amount, Parent shall obtain as much
comparable insurance as may be available for the Insurance Amount.

 

(c) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties, rights
and other assets to any Person, then, in each such case to the extent
so required, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that such
successor or assign of the Surviving Company assumes the obligations set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.9_ are intended to be for the
benefit of, and will be enforceable by, the Company Indemnified Parties
following the Closing and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification, advancement or contribution that any such
Person may have by Law, Contract or otherwise.

 

Section 5.10. _Employee_ _Matters_.

 

(a) For a period commencing on the Effective Time, and ending on December 31,
2019, the Surviving Company will provide individuals who are employees of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and
continue to be employees of Parent or one of the Parent Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Company) immediately following the Effective Time,
but only for so long as such individuals are so employed (each, a "
_Continuing Employee_ "), (i) a base salary, regular hourly wage, or
commission opportunities, as applicable, that are not less than the base
salary, regular hourly wage, or commission opportunities, as applicable,
provided to such Continuing Employees by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries on the date of this Agreement, (ii) target cash incentive
compensation opportunities (excluding equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities) that are not less than the target cash incentive compensation
opportunities (excluding equity-based incentives) provided to such Continuing
Employees by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries on the date of this
Agreement, and (iii) employee benefits (other than equity-based awards) that
are either (A) substantially comparable to the employee benefits (other than
equity-based awards, including under the ESPP) provided by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary on the date of this Agreement or (B) substantially
comparable to the employee benefits (other than equity-based awards) provided
to similarly-situated employees of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries.

 

(b) As of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Company and any applicable Company Subsidiary to, (i) give Continuing
Employees credit for purposes of eligibility, benefit accrual, vesting and
entitlement to benefits where length of service is relevant (but not for any
purposes under any employee benefit plan that is a defined 

 



52

    

 benefit pension plan) under any employee benefit and compensation plans or
arrangements maintained by Parent or an applicable Parent Subsidiary that such
employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time (" _New
Plans_ ") for such Continuing Employees service with the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries to the same extent that such service was credited for
purposes of any comparable employee benefit plan of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time and in no event shall
service prior to the Effective Time be required to be taken into account if
such service credit would result in the duplication of benefits with respect
to the same period. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent shall provide that (i) each Company Employee shall be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
New Plans to the extent coverage under such New Plan replaces coverage under
a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately before the replacement, and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, all pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements or waiting periods of such New Plan
be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the extent
waived or not applicable under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee Participated immediately before the replacement, and any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
under a Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year prior to the
Effective Time to taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-insurance, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the remainder of the applicable plan year during which the Effective Time
occurs as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

(c) From and after the Effective Time, the Company or the Surviving Company,
as applicable, will, and Parent will cause the Company or the Surviving
Company, as applicable, to, honor, in accordance with their terms, (i) the
2018 Corporate Incentive Plan and the Executive Leadership Team
2018 Supplemental Bonus Program and (ii) all employment, severance, income
continuity and change of control programs, plans or agreements between the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and the Continuing Employees including
bonuses, incentives, severance payments or deferred compensation in existence
on the date hereof, in each case, in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately prior to the date of this Agreement or to the extent amended in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or in accordance with the terms
of such programs, plans or agreements as in effect prior to the Effective
Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event).

(d) No provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall be construed as a
limitation on the right of Parent, or to cause any Parent Subsidiary to, amend
or terminate any specific employee benefit plan that Parent or a Parent
Subsidiary would otherwise have under the terms of such employee benefit
plan, nor shall any provision of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ be construed to
require the continuation of the employment of any particular Continuing
Employee. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ are solely for
the benefit of the Parties, and no Company Employee or any other Person shall
be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_, and nothing herein
shall be construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan of Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary or other compensation or benefit plan or arrangement
for any purpose.

 



53

    

Section 5.11. _Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be listed on Nasdaq, subject to official notice
of issuance, prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.12. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause any
acquisitions or dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative
securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.13. _Stockholder Litigation_. Prior to the Effective Time, in the
event that any litigation or other Proceeding of any stockholder related to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is brought, or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against
any of the Company and/or the members of the Company Board prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
litigation or other Proceeding and shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a
reasonably current basis with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
consult with Parent on a regular basis with respect to, and shall give Parent
the opportunity to participate, at Parents expense, in the defense or
settlement of, any such litigation or Claims, and no such settlement or
compromise shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 5.14.  _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law becomes applicable to any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall take all
action reasonably necessary to enable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms

(including Merger Sub) to and the Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
and the New Holding Company to) each (i) use reasonable best efforts to cause

Holding Company Merger and the Conversion, taken together, to in each case
constitute a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) neither
take any action nor fail to take any action if such action or such failure
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede (x) the Merger and the
Sirius XM Radio Merger, taken together, or (y) the Holding Company Merger and

reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and (iii) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain the opinion described in Section 6.2(f) (in
the case of Parent and Merger Sub) and the opinion described in Section
6.3(e) (in the case of the Company). The obligations of Parent and the Company
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.16(a)_ shall include negotiating in good
faith such amendments to this Agreement as may be reasonably required in
order to restructure the transactions set forth herein if such restructuring
would be necessary to allow Parent to obtain the opinion described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_ or the Company to obtain the opinion described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_, including any other additional or alternative steps
that could be taken to preserve the intended treatment of the transactions set

described in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ cannot be obtained despite the
reasonable best efforts described in _Section_ __ _ 5.16(a)_, the closing
conditions in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(f)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_ shall not
apply and the parties hereto (i) shall execute a reverse subsidiary merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company, with the Company surviving such merger
(the " _Alternative Reverse Subsidiary Merger_ ") (it being understood that
under such circumstances, the Alternative Reverse Subsidiary Merger shall be
structured so that it shall be treated as a taxable stock sale by the Company
shareholders (other than Parent or any Parent Subsidiaries) for U.S. federal
income tax purposes), and (ii) shall not effect the Sirius XM Radio Merger,
the Holding Company Merger or the Conversion and, to the extent necessary,
shall negotiate in good faith such amendments to this Agreement as may be
reasonably required in order to execute such Alternative Reverse Subsidiary
Merger and to not effect the Sirius XM Radio Merger, the Holding Company
Merger or the Conversion.

legal opinions, officers certificates or other documents or instruments
required in connection with the consummation of the Merger or otherwise
reasonably requested by Parent and (iv) taking such actions as necessary to
ensure that, at the Effective Time, each outstanding Convertible Note shall no
longer be convertible into shares of Company Common Stock and shall instead be
determined by reference to the Merger Consideration, in each case of clauses
(i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of
the Convertible Notes Indenture (including the time periods specified
therein). The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review
and to comment on such documents or instruments and shall take into account in
good faith any such comments as reasonably proposed by Parent or its counsel.

amount required to pay off in full on the Closing Date the Credit Agreement
and the commitment of the relevant creditors or agent to release any liens
and terminate all guarantees in connection therewith following satisfaction of

at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to clauses  _(A)_ ,

_Section_ __ _ 7.1(f)_ and pay the Go-Shop Termination Fee; or

61

    

 Date (in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)_)
or the time of the vote taken on the Company Stockholder Approval at the
Company Stockholders Meeting (in the case of a termination pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(iii))_, and (C) within twelve (12) months of the date
of the termination of this Agreement, the Company enters into an agreement
with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal or a transaction in respect of
a Company Acquisition Proposal is consummated (in each case, whether or not
with a Person that made a Company Acquisition Proposal referenced in clause
(B)); _provided_ that solely for the purposes of clause (C), all references
in the definition of "Company Acquisition Proposal" to "15%" shall be deemed
to be references to "50%".

 

(c) If the Company Termination Fee becomes payable (except pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)(iii)_) or the Go-Shop Termination Fee becomes payable,
such fee shall be paid on the date the Agreement is terminated. If the Company
Termination Fee becomes payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)(iii)_,
the Company Termination Fee shall be paid on the date the Company enters into
an agreement with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal (or, if earlier,
the date a transaction in respect of a Company Acquisition Proposal is
consummated). The Company Termination Fee and the Go-Shop Termination Fee
shall, if payable, be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated by Parent.

 

(d) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section_
__ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. If the Company fails promptly to pay the Company Termination
Fee or the Go-Shop Termination Fee, and, in order to obtain such payment,
Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the
payment thereof or a settlement in which the Company pays all or any portion
of the Company Termination Fee or the Go-Shop Termination Fee, the Company
shall pay to Parent its reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the Company Termination Fee or the Go-Shop Termination Fee, as
applicable, from the date of the Company Termination Fee or the Go-Shop
Termination Fee was payable pursuant to this Agreement at a rate per annum
equal to the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal on the date
such payment was required to be made.
