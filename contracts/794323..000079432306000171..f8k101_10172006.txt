AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of October 16, 2006 (this
"Agreement"), among LEVEL 3 COMMUNICATIONS, INC., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), LEVEL 3 SERVICES, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), LEVEL
3 COLORADO, INC., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent ("Sister Subsidiary"), and BROADWING CORPORATION, a Delaware
corporation (the "Company").    W I T N E S S E T H:  - - - - - - - - -
-   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company
and the Board of Managers of Merger Sub have each approved and
declared advisable the merger of the Company with and into Merger Sub (the
"Merger"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, pursuant to which each outstanding share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of the Company ("Company Common Stock") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Dissenting
Shares, will be converted into the right to receive a combination of cash and
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent ("Parent Common
Stock");   WHEREAS, as a condition to Parent entering into this
Agreement and incurring the obligations set forth herein, concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, Parent is entering into a
Voting Agreement with certain affiliated stockholders of the Company (the
"Voting Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, each of those
stockholders has agreed, subject to the terms thereof, to vote all shares of
Company Common Stock owned by such stockholder in accordance with the terms
of the Voting Agreement;   WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and also to prescribe
various conditions to the transactions contemplated hereby; and   WHEREAS,
for federal income tax purposes, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company intend
that the merger shall qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"),
and the regulations promulgated thereunder ("Treasury Regulations"), and, by
approving resolutions authorizing this Agreement, to adopt this Agreement as
a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and
the Treasury Regulations.   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the
foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements set forth herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereto agree as follows:    ARTICLE I.   THE MERGER   Section
1.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub and the
separate existence of the Company shall thereupon cease, and Merger Sub, as
the surviving entity in the Merger (the "Surviving Company"), shall by virtue
of the Merger continue its existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.
If the Requisite Consent has not been obtained on or prior to the Conversion
Date, the "Merger" shall instead be a merger (upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth in this Agreement) of Merger Sub with and into the
Company at the Effective Time, in which case, the separate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease upon the Merger and the Company, as the surviving
entity in the Merger, shall continue as the Surviving Company. Such change to
the terms of the Merger on the Conversion Date in accordance with the prior
sentence shall be referred to as a "Conversion Event." If there is a
Conversion Event, Parent shall cause Merger Sub, prior to the Effective Time,
to be converted into a corporation pursuant to Section 265 of the DGCL.  
Section 1.2. Subsequent Merger.   (a) If there is a Conversion Event, (i)
Parent, Merger Sub, Sister Subsidiary and the Company shall, promptly after
the Conversion Date, amend this Agreement to include representations,
warranties and covenants of Sister Subsidiary which are substantially
equivalent to the representations, warranties and covenants of Merger Sub and
such other changes to this Agreement as may be reasonably necessary to effect
the Merger following the Conversion Event and the Subsequent Merger discussed
below and (ii) immediately following the Effective Time and in accordance
with the DGCL, Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to merge with and
into Sister Subsidiary and the separate corporate existence of the Surviving
Company shall thereupon cease (the "Subsequent Merger") and
Sister Subsidiary, as the surviving corporation in the Subsequent Merger,
shall by virtue of the Subsequent Merger continue its existence under the
laws of the State of Delaware. At the effective time of the Subsequent Merger
and without any further action on the part of the Surviving Company, Parent,
Sister Subsidiary or any holder of any capital stock of the Surviving
Company, Parent or Sister Subsidiary, each share of common stock, par value
$0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Company issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the effective time of the Subsequent Merger shall be
converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of
Sister Subsidiary.   (b) In the event of the Subsequent Merger, references
herein to the "Surviving Company" shall refer after the effective time of the
Subsequent Merger, to Sister Subsidiary.   (c) If there is a Conversion
Event, this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization"
with respect to the Merger and Subsequent Merger, taken together, for United
States federal income tax purposes pursuant to which, for such purposes, the
Merger and the Subsequent Merger, taken together, are to be treated as a
"reorganization" under Section 368(a) of the Code (to which each of Parent,
Sister Subsidiary and the Company are to be parties under Section 368(b) of
the Code) in which the Company is to be treated as merging directly  
2   with and into Sister Subsidiary with the Company Common Stock converted
in such merger into the right to receive the consideration provided for
hereunder.   Section 1.3. Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.1, the closing of the
Merger (the "Closing") will take place on the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of the conditions
(excluding conditions that, by their terms, cannot be satisfied until the
Closing Date, but subject to the satisfaction or, where permitted, waiver of
those conditions as of the Closing) set forth in Article VIII, unless another
time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date of the
Closing, the "Closing Date"). The Closing shall be held at the offices of
Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New York 10019,
unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.  
Section 1.4. Effective Time. Upon the Closing, the parties shall file with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger (the
"Certificate of Merger"). The Merger shall become effective at such time
as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware or at such subsequent time as Parent and the Company shall
agree and as shall be specified in the Certificate of Merger (the date and
time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").   Section
1.5. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the LLCA or, if there is a Conversion Event, the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the property, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Company.   Section 1.6. Certificate of
Formation. Unless there is a Conversion Event, the certificate of formation
of Merger Sub shall be the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company
after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as provided therein
or by law, except that the certificate of formation of the Surviving Company
shall be amended to provide that the name of the Surviving Company is
"Broadwing LLC." If there is a Conversion Event, the certificate of
incorporation of Merger Sub shall be the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Company after the Effective Time, and thereafter may be amended as
provided therein or by law, except that the certificate of incorporation of
the Surviving Company shall be amended to provide that the name of the
Surviving Company is "Broadwing Corporation."   Section 1.7. Operating
Agreement. Unless there is a Conversion Event, the operating agreement of
Merger Sub as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the operating
agreement of the Surviving Company, and thereafter may be amended as provided
therein or by law. If there is a Conversion Event, the bylaws of Merger Sub
as in effect at the Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving
Company, and thereafter may be amended as provided therein or by law.  
Section 1.8. Managers; Officers. Unless there is a Conversion Event, the
managers and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the managers and officers of the Surviving Company until
their respective successors are duly   3   elected and qualified or
until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with the LLCA and the
certificate of formation and operating agreement of the Surviving Company. If
there is a Conversion Event, the directors and officers of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors and officers
of the Surviving Company until their respective successors are duly elected
and qualified or until their death, resignation or removal in accordance with
the DGCL and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Company.   Section 1.9. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective
Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof:   (a) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares),
shall be converted into the right to receive (i) 1.3411 (the "Exchange
Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock, subject
to Section 2.5 with respect to fractional shares (the "Stock Consideration"),
and (ii) $8.18 in cash (the "Cash Consideration" and, together with the Stock
Consideration, the "Merger Consideration").   (b) All shares of Company
Common Stock (other than shares referred to in Section 1.9(d)) shall cease to
be outstanding and shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (a "Certificate")
shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of
Company Common Stock, except the right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders become entitled all in accordance with Article II upon the surrender
of such Certificate.   (c) Unless there is a Conversion Event, each
membership interest of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain issued, outstanding and unchanged as a
membership interest of the Surviving Company. If there is a Conversion Event,
each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into one share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving
Company.   (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are owned by stockholders that have
properly perfected their rights of appraisal within the meaning of Section
262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, unless and until such stockholders
shall have failed to perfect any available right of appraisal under
applicable law, but, instead, the holders thereof shall be entitled to
payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance with
Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or
shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right of appraisal, the shares
of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder shall not be deemed
Dissenting Shares for purposes of this Agreement and shall thereupon be
deemed to have been converted into the Merger Consideration at the
Effective Time in accordance with Section 1.9(a). The Company shall give
Parent (A) prompt notice of any demands for appraisal filed pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands
and any other instruments served or delivered in   4   connection with
such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company and (B) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands made pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall not,
except with the prior written consent of Parent, (x) make any payment
with respect to any such demand, (y) offer to settle or settle any such
demand or (z) waive any failure to timely deliver a written demand for
appraisal or timely take any other action to perfect appraisal rights in
accordance with the DGCL.   (e) If prior to the Effective Time, Parent or
the Company, as the case may be, should split, combine or otherwise
reclassify the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, or pay a
stock dividend or other stock distribution in Parent Common Stock or Company
Common Stock, as applicable, or otherwise change the Parent Common Stock or
Company Common Stock into any other securities, or make any other such stock
dividend or distribution in capital stock of Parent or the Company in respect
of the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, respectively, then
any number or amount contained herein which is based upon the price of the
Parent Common Stock or the number of shares of Company Common Stock or Parent
Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.   Section
1.10. Treatment of Options, Warrants and Other Stock Awards.   (a) The
Company shall take all actions necessary and appropriate to provide that upon
the Effective Time, each outstanding employee, director or consultant stock
option to purchase Company Common Stock (collectively, "Company
Options") granted under any Company Stock Plan whether or not then
exercisable or vested, shall be cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each
holder of such Company Option shall receive: (i) an amount in cash in respect
thereof, if any, equal to the product of (x) the Cash Percentage, (y) the
excess, if any, of the Deemed Value of Merger Consideration over the per
share exercise price thereof and (z) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option (such cash payment to be net of
applicable withholding taxes); and (ii) a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock in respect thereof, if any, equal to the quotient of (A) the product of
(x) the Stock Percentage, (y) the excess, if any, of the Deemed Value of
Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price thereof and (z) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
divided by (B) the Parent Common Stock Price, provided, that any fractional
shares that would otherwise be issuable pursuant to this Section 1.10(a)
shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number.   (b) All shares of
restricted Company Common Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (and
any other shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or future
issuance under the Company Stock Plans) (collectively, "Other Stock Awards")
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then
vested, shall be treated in the same manner as all other shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 1.9 of this Agreement and all such Other Stock Awards
shall be fully vested as of the Effective Time.   (c) At the Effective
Time, each unexercised warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
(the "Company Warrants") then outstanding will be assumed by Parent, in
accordance with the terms of such Company Warrants. Each such outstanding  
5   Company Warrant so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue
to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in such
Company Warrants immediately prior to the Effective Time, except as modified
as a result of the Merger pursuant to the terms of such Company Warrants.  
(d) With respect to the Company\'s Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP"),
the Company shall take all actions necessary to (i) cause the
current Offering Period (within the meaning of the ESPP) to terminate at the
Effective Time (if the Effective Time is earlier than the date the current
Offering Period would otherwise terminate); (ii) prevent any further
contributions to the current Offering Period after the date hereof, and (iii)
refrain from commencing any new Offering Periods under the ESPP
thereafter.   (e) Unless there is a Conversion Event, the Surviving Company
shall, upon the Effective Time, succeed to and be substituted for the Company
under the Indenture. Following the Effective Time, the Convertible Debentures
will thereafter be convertible upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Indenture after giving effect to the Merger and any notice
delivered by the Company pursuant to Section 5.4 of this Agreement.   (f)
The Company and Parent shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.10 and any other dispositions
of Company equity securities (including derivative securities)
or acquisitions of Parent equity securities (including derivative securities)
in connection with this Agreement by each individual who (i) is a director
or officer of the Company or (ii) at the Effective Time will become a
director or officer of Parent to become exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated
under the Exchange Act.   ARTICLE II.   EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES  
Section 2.1. Exchange Fund. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. or such other bank or trust company
as Parent shall determine and who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Company (the "Exchange Agent"), in trust for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with Section 1.9, (i)
certificates representing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
sufficient to deliver, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent to timely
deliver, in accordance with the terms of Section 2.2 of this Agreement, the
aggregate Stock Consideration, and (ii) immediately available funds equal to
the aggregate Cash Consideration and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent
to timely pay the Cash Consideration subject to and in accordance with the
terms of Section 2.2 of this Agreement. Parent agrees to make available to
the Exchange Agent from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and
certificates of Parent Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent shall
hereinafter be referred to as the "Exchange Fund."   Section 2.2. Exchange
Procedures. As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange
Agent will send to each record holder of a Certificate other than
Certificates in respect of Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon   6   delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate, upon surrender of a Certificate to the Exchange
Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate or
certificates representing the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock
and the amount of cash (including amounts to be paid pursuant to Section
1.9(a) and in respect of any dividends or other distributions to which
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, if any), into which the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by
such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement. The
Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable pursuant to Section
1.9(a) or 2.3. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, one or
more shares of Parent Common Stock evidencing, in the aggregate, the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, a check in the proper amount of cash
pursuant to Section 1.9(a) and any dividends or other distributions to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, may be issued with respect
to such Company Common Stock to such a transferee only if the Certificate
representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange
Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid.   Section 2.3. Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares.
No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to shares
of Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be
paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive
upon surrender of such Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to such
holder of shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in exchange therefor,
without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such surrender, the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock, and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable with
respect to such shares of Parent Common Stock.   Section 2.4. No Further
Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. All shares of Parent Common Stock

the participant\'s employment with the Company or its Subsidiaries (or,
if applicable, the Surviving Company or its Subsidiaries) has terminated

participant\'s employment agreement, severance agreement or offer letter or
if the participant does not have an employment agreement, severance agreement
or offer letter that defines "cause", the Company\'s 2000 Long Term Incentive
Plan as of the date of this Agreement) or (ii) the participant voluntarily
terminates such participant\'s employment, except where the participant
terminated his or her employment for "Good Reason" or as a result of a

agreement, severance agreement or offer letter or if the participant does not
have an employment agreement, severance agreement or offer letter that
defines "Good Reason" or "Constructive Termination," the Company\'s 2000 Long
Term Incentive Plan as of the date of this Agreement). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Parent shall not be required to
cause the Surviving Company to pay any amounts under the 2006 Bonus Plan
unless, as of September 30, 2006, the Company had accrued an aggregate
liability with respect to its obligations under the 2006 Bonus Plan as set
forth on Schedule 3.20(l).   (e) After the date hereof, the Company shall
adopt a special bonus plan (the "Special Bonus Plan") under which management
of the Company, in its sole discretion, shall allocate an aggregate amount
not to exceed $5.0 million for special bonuses to the employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries. The special bonuses shall be paid out to each
employee designated to participate in the Special Bonus Plan as set forth on
Schedule 6.1(e) (each, a "Participant") as to 2/3rds of the Participant\'s
total special bonus on the three (3) month anniversary of the Effective Time
and as to the remaining 1/3rd of the total special bonus on the six (6) month
anniversary of the Effective Time. Such payments shall be made whether or not
the Participant is an employee of the Company as of the applicable payments
dates, unless the Participant\'s employment with the Company (or, if
applicable, the Surviving Company) has terminated prior to the applicable
payment date either (i) for "cause" (as defined in such Participant\'s
employment agreement, severance agreement or offer letter or if the
Participant does not have an employment agreement, severance agreement
or offer letter that defines "cause", the Company\'s 2000 Long Term Incentive
Plan as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) or (ii) the
Participant voluntarily terminates Participant\'s employment, except where
the Participant terminates employment for "Good Reason" or as a result of a
"Constructive Termination" (as defined in such Participant\'s employment
agreement, severance agreement or offer letter or if the Participant does not
have an employment agreement, severance agreement or offer letter that
defines "Good Reason" or "Constructive Termination," the Company\'s 2000 Long
Term Incentive Plan as of the date of this Agreement).   (f) Except as
provided in this Section 6.1, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or
restrict the right of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to modify, amend,
terminate or establish employee benefit plans or arrangements, in whole or in
part, at any time after the Effective Time.   38    (g) No provision of
this Section 6.1 shall create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Continuing Employee or any current or former director or consultant of the
Company or its Subsidiaries located in the United States in respect of
continued employment (or resumed employment) or any other matter.   Section
6.2. Indemnification Continuation.   (a) For purposes of this Section 6.2,
(i) "Indemnified Person" shall mean any person who is now, or has been at any
time prior to the Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or
who was serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of
another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise, and can provide
evidence thereof to Parent acceptable to Parent in its sole discretion (which
such discretion shall be reasonably applied) and (ii) "Proceeding" shall mean
any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether or not such
claim, proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or criminal
litigation or regulatory action.   (b) From and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall, or Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, provide
indemnification (including, but not limited to, attorneys\' fees and other
defense costs) to each Indemnified Person to the same extent and under
similar conditions and procedures as such Indemnified Person is entitled on
the date hereof, under the Company Organizational Documents, in connection
with any Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) on, or
arising directly or indirectly (in whole or in part) out of, the fact that
such Indemnified Person is or was an officer or director of the Company, or
is or was serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of
another corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of
any partnership or a trustee of any trust, whether pertaining to any matter
arising before or after the Effective Time (including, but not limited to,
any acts or omissions in connection with this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby). Any right of
indemnification of an Indemnified Person pursuant to this Section 6.2(b)
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at any time in a manner
that would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Person as provided
herein.   (c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to, and the Surviving
Company shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time the
Company\'s current directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons ("DandO; Insurance") (provided that the
Surviving Company may substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of
at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that are not
materially less favorable to the Indemnified Persons); provided, however,
that in no event shall the Surviving Company be required to expend pursuant
to this Section 6.2(c) more than an amount per year equal to 200% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that,
but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving
Company would be required to expend more than 200% of current annual
premiums, the Surviving Company shall obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 200% of current
annual premiums. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase, prior to
the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officers\' and directors\'
liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person.   39    (d)
The provisions of this Section 6.2 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger for a period of six years and are expressly intended to benefit
each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective heirs and
representatives; provided, however, that in the event that any claim or
claims for indemnification set forth in Section 6.2 are asserted or made
within such six-year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any
such claim or claims shall continue until disposition of any and all such
claims. If Parent and/or Surviving Company, or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of their businesses or
assets to any other Person, then, in each such case, to the extent necessary,
a proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent
and/or Surviving Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of
Parent and Surviving Company set forth in this Section 6.2.   Section 6.3.
Notice of Breach. From and after the date hereof and until the earlier to
occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Article IX hereof, Parent shall promptly give written notice with
particularity upon having knowledge of any matter that may constitute a
breach by Parent of any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant
contained in this Agreement.   ARTICLE VII.   ADDITIONAL COVENANTS OF THE
PARTIES.   Section 7.1. Preparation of Proxy Statement and
Registration Statement; Company Stockholders Meeting.   (a) As promptly as
practicable, the Company shall prepare and file the Proxy Statement with the
SEC, and Parent shall prepare and file the Registration Statement (in which
the Proxy Statement will be included) with the SEC. Parent and the Company
shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the Registration Statement
to become effective under the Securities Act as soon after such filing as
practicable and to keep the Registration Statement effective as long as is
necessary to consummate the Merger. The Proxy Statement shall include the
recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company in favor of approval
and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, except to the extent the Board
of Directors of the Company shall have withdrawn or modified its approval or
recommendation of this Agreement to the extent such action is permitted by
Section 7.5. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to its stockholders as promptly as practicable
after the Registration Statement becomes effective. The parties shall
promptly provide copies, consult with each other and prepare
written responses with respect to any written comments received from the SEC
with respect to the Proxy Statement and the Registration Statement and advise
one another of any oral comments received from the SEC. The Registration
Statement and the Proxy Statement shall comply as to form in all material
respects with the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively.   (b) Parent and the
Company shall make all necessary filings with respect to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby under the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act and applicable "blue sky" laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Each party will advise the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof,
of the time when the Registration   40   Statement has become effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock
issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement
or the Registration Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or
requests by the SEC for additional information. No amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement shall be filed without the
approval of both parties hereto, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. If at any time prior to the Effective Time,
any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent or the
Company that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Proxy Statement, so that such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.   (c) The Company shall cause the
Company Stockholders Meeting to be duly called and held as soon as reasonably
practicable for the purpose of obtaining the Required Company Vote. In
connection with such meeting, the Company will (i) subject to Section 7.5(b),
use its commercially reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Company
Vote and (ii) otherwise comply with all legal requirements applicable to such
meeting.   Section 7.2. Access to Information.   Upon reasonable notice,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to Parent and
its representatives reasonable access during normal business hours, during
the period prior to the Effective Time, to all its officers, employees,
properties, offices, plants and other facilities and to all books and records
and, during such period, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to) furnish promptly to Parent and its representatives, consistent with its
legal obligations, all other information concerning its business, properties
and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however, that the
Company may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that, in the
Company\'s reasonable judgment, (i) providing such access would result in the
disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of
its obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have
used all reasonable efforts to obtain the consent of such third party to such
access, or (ii) any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any Governmental
Entity applicable to the Company requires the Company or its Subsidiaries to
preclude Parent and its representatives from gaining access to any properties
or information. Parent will hold any such information that is non-public in
confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions
of that certain Confidentiality Agreement, dated December 8, 2003 (the
"Confidentiality Agreement"), between the Company and Parent.   Section
7.3. HSR Act and Regulatory Matters.   (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, each party will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to   41   consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as soon as practicable after the date hereof.
In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable, and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement, and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act and to take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable.   (b) Each of Parent and the Company
shall, in connection with the efforts referenced in Section 7.3(a) to obtain
all requisite approvals and authorizations for the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the FCC Act or any other Regulatory Law
(as defined below), use its commercially reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party; (ii) promptly inform
the other party of any communication received by such party from, or given by
such party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (the
"DOJ"), the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") or any other governmental
authority and of any material communication received or given in connection
with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and (iii) permit the other party to review
any communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of
any meeting or conference with, the DOJ, the FTC, the FCC or any such other
governmental authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
party, with any other Person, and to the extent permitted by the DOJ, the
FTC, the FCC or such other applicable governmental authority or other Person,
give the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in
such meetings and conferences. For purposes of this Agreement, "Regulatory
Law" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR
Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, the Communications Act of
1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and all other
federal, state and foreign, if any, statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines and other laws that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition through merger or acquisition. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the covenants of the parties contained in Section 7.3(a) and
this Section 7.3(b), each party hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts
to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Regulatory Law.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent
shall not be required to agree to any terms, conditions, modifications with
respect to obtaining any consents, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders in connection with the Merger or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement that would
result in, or would reasonably likely to result in, either individually or in
the aggregate, (i) a material adverse effect on the business or operations of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (assuming Parent is the size of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or (ii) Parent, the Company or any
of their respective Subsidiaries having to cease, sell or otherwise dispose
of any assets or business (including the requirement that any such assets or
businesses be held separate).   42    (c) The Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents, waivers,
authorizations and approvals of all third parties, including Governmental
Entities, necessary, proper or advisable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, without the prior
written consent of Parent, the Company shall not incur any
significant expense or liability or agree to any significant modification to
any contractual arrangement to obtain such consents or certificates, and to
provide any notices to third parties required to be provided prior to the
Effective Time.   Section 7.4. Reorganization.   (a) The parties intend
that the Merger or, if there is a Conversion Event, the Merger and the
Subsequent Merger, taken together, qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and will report it as such for federal,
state and local income tax purposes. None of the parties will knowingly take
any action or fail to take any action, which action or failure to act would
cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  
(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts
to provide the officers\' certificates and to obtain the opinions referred to
in Section 8.2(c) and Section 8.3(c) hereto, respectively.   (c) Unless
there is a Conversion Event, the parties agree that Merger Sub shall be
treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes and
agree not to take any action that would be inconsistent with such
treatment.   Section 7.5. Acquisition Proposals.   (a) None of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries shall (whether directly or indirectly through
Affiliates, directors, officers, representatives or other intermediaries),
nor shall (directly or indirectly) the Company authorize or permit any of its
or their officers, directors, representatives or other intermediaries or
Subsidiaries to, (i) solicit, initiate or take any action to facilitate or
encourage the submission of inquiries, proposals or offers from any Person
(other than Parent) relating to any Acquisition Proposal, or agree to or
endorse any Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into any agreement to
(x) facilitate or consummate, any Acquisition Proposal, (y) approve or
endorse any Acquisition Proposal or (z) in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, require it to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger;
(iii) enter into or participate in any discussions or negotiations in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal or inquiry with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to its business, properties or assets in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry with respect to any Acquisition Proposal; or (iv) agree
to resolve or take any of the actions prohibited by clause (i), (ii) or (iii)
of this sentence. The Company shall immediately cease, and cause its
representatives and other intermediaries to immediately cease, any and all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and shall demand the return
or destruction of any information previously provided with respect to such
activities, discussion, or negotiations. For purposes of this Section 7.5,
the term "Person" means any person, corporation, entity or "group," as
defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, other than Parent or any
Subsidiaries of Parent.   43    "Acquisition Proposal" means any offer or
proposal for a merger, reorganization, recapitalization, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction involving the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries or any proposal or offer to acquire,
directly or indirectly, securities representing more than 20% of the voting
power of the Company or more than 20% of the assets of the Company and the
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, other than the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement.   (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of
the Company, directly or indirectly through representatives or other
intermediaries, may (i) comply with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated
under the Exchange Act with regard to any Acquisition Proposal, so long as
any such compliance rejects any Acquisition Proposal and reaffirms its
recommendation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except to
the extent such action is permitted by clause (iv) of this Section 7.5(b),
(ii) engage in negotiations or discussions with any Person that has made an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal not resulting from or
arising out of a breach of Section 7.5(a), (iii) furnish to such Person
nonpublic information relating to the Company or any of the Subsidiaries
pursuant to a confidentiality and standstill agreement with terms that are
substantially similar to, and no less favorable in any material respect to,
the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement and in the
confidentiality agreement, dated August 5, 2002, between Parent and the
Company (it being understood that the standstill provision contained in
such confidentiality and standstill agreement may permit such Person to
convey confidentially an Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of
the Company under circumstances in which the Company is permitted under this
Section 7.5 to participate in discussions regarding an Acquisition Proposal)
and/or (iv) if prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, withdraw or modify
or change in a manner adverse to Parent its approval or recommendation of
this Agreement or the Merger; provided that the Board of Directors of the
Company shall be permitted to take an action described in the foregoing
clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) if, and only if, prior to taking such
particular action, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in
good faith by a majority vote that (x) such Acquisition Proposal would result
in, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, in the
case of any of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) or (iii), or constitutes a
Superior Proposal, in the case of the foregoing clause (iv), and (y) (in
consultation with outside legal counsel) taking such action would be
reasonably likely to be required by its fiduciary duties under the DGCL.  
"Superior Proposal" means any proposal (on its most recently amended
or modified terms, if amended or modified) made by a third party to enter
into any transaction involving an Acquisition Proposal that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in its good faith judgment (after
consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside legal
counsel) to be more favorable to the Company\'s stockholders than this
Agreement and the Merger, taking into account all terms and conditions of
such transaction (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provision and financial terms, the anticipated timing, conditions and
prospects for completion of such transaction, including the prospects for
obtaining regulatory approvals and financing, and any third party approvals),
except that the reference to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%". Reference to "this
Agreement" and "the Merger" in this paragraph shall be deemed to include any
proposed alteration of the terms of this Agreement or the Merger that
are agreed to by Parent   44   after it receives written notice from the
Company pursuant to Section 7.5(d) of the existence of, the identity of the
Person making, and the terms and conditions of, any Acquisition Proposal.  
(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.5 to the contrary, if, at any
time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, the Company\'s Board
of Directors determines (i) in good faith, in response to an Acquisition
Proposal that was unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a breach
of Section 7.5(a), that such proposal is a Superior Proposal, and (ii) (in
consultation with outside legal counsel) that taking such action would be
reasonably likely to be required by its fiduciary duties under the DGCL, the
Company or its Board of Directors may, subject to complying with Section
9.2(c), accept such Superior Proposal and withdraw, modify or amend its
recommendation of the Merger; provided, however, that prior to any such
withdrawal, modification or amendment to the recommendation of the Company\'s
Board of Directors, the Company shall have given Parent five (5) Business
Days\' written notice (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to
the amount or form of consideration of the Superior Proposal shall require a
new notice and a new five (5) Business Day period) advising Parent that the
Company\'s Board of Directors intends to cause the Company to accept such
Superior Proposal, specifying the material terms and conditions of the
Superior Proposal and that the Company shall, during such five (5) Business
Day period, negotiate in good faith with Parent to make such adjustments to
the Merger Consideration and other terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior
Proposal.   (d) The Company shall notify Parent promptly (but in any event
within 24 hours) after receipt or occurrence of (i) any Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) any request for information with respect to any Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) any inquiry, proposal, discussions or negotiation with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, and (iv) the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry, proposal, discussion
or negotiation and the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition
Proposal, request for information, inquiry or proposal or with whom
discussions or negotiations are taking place. In addition, the Company shall
promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) after the receipt thereof,
provide to Parent copies of any written documentation material to
understanding such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry,
proposal, discussion or negotiation ("Other Acquisition Documentation") which
is received by the Company from the Person (or from any representatives or
agents of such Person) making such Acquisition Proposal, request for
information, inquiry or proposal or with whom such discussions
or negotiations are taking place. The Company shall not, and shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision
of any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the provisions of any such agreement; provided,
however, that, the Company may waive any such provision in response to an
Acquisition Proposal to the Board of Directors of the Company made
confidentially under circumstances in which the Company is permitted under
this Section 7.5 to participate in discussions regarding an Acquisition
Proposal, but only to the extent necessary to allow it to respond to such
Acquisition Proposal as permitted under this Section 7.5. The Company shall
keep Parent fully informed of the status and details (including any
amendments or proposed amendments) of any such Acquisition Proposal or
request for information and keep Parent fully informed as to the material
details of any information requested of or provided by the Company and as to
the material details of all discussions or   45   negotiations with
respect to any such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry or
proposal and shall provide to Parent within one Business Day after receipt
thereof all copies of any additional Other Acquisition Documentation received
by the Company from the Person (or from any representatives or agents of such
Person) making such Acquisition Proposal, request for information, inquiry or
proposal or with whom such discussions or negotiations are taking place. The
Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company provided to any other Person in connection with any
Acquisition Proposal that was not previously provided to Parent. Any such
non-public information shall be held by Parent subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Board of Directors of the Company shall
promptly consider in good faith (in consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisors) any proposed alteration of the terms of
this Agreement or the Merger proposed by Parent in response to any
Acquisition Proposal.   Section 7.6. Stockholder Litigation. The Company
shall keep Parent informed of, and cooperate with Parent in connection with,
any stockholder litigation or claim against the Company and/or its directors
or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; provided, however, that no settlement in connection with such
stockholder litigation shall be agreed to without Parent\'s prior written
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.   Section 7.7. Maintenance of Insurance. The Company will use
reasonable best efforts to maintain in full force and effect through the
Closing Date all material insurance policies applicable to the Company and
its Subsidiaries and their respective properties and assets in effect on the
date hereof. If and as requested by Parent, the Company will use commercially
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company\'s insurers to waive any
provisions in such insurance policies that would allow the insurer to
terminate or adversely modify coverage upon consummation of the Merger.  
Section 7.8. Public Announcements. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written
consent of the Company and Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as such release or announcement may
be required by law or the rules or regulations of any applicable United
States securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the
release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow each
other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be at
the final discretion of the disclosing party.   Section 7.9. No Shareholder
Rights Plan. From the date hereof through the earlier of termination of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company will not adopt, approve, or
agree to adopt, a shareholder rights plan.   Section 7.10. Stock Exchange
Listing. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger to
be approved for quotation on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of
issuance.   46    ARTICLE VIII.   CONDITIONS PRECEDENT   Section 8.1.

decree, ruling, shall have been adopted or promulgated, and no temporary
restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other order issued
by a court or other U.S. governmental authority of competent
jurisdiction shall be in effect as of the Closing Date, having the effect of
making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
Merger; provided, however, that the provisions of this Section 8.1(b) shall
not be available to any party whose failure to fulfill its obligations
pursuant to Section 7.3 shall have been the cause of, or shall have resulted
in, such order or injunction.   (c) HSR Act. The waiting period (and any
extension thereof) applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act shall have been
terminated or shall have expired.   (d) Nasdaq Listing. The shares of Parent

to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of the Company Warrants and
conversion of the Convertible Debentures shall have been approved for

(or any successor inter-dealer quotation system or stock exchange thereto)

contained in Section 3.6 (Capitalization and Related Matters) and Section
3.32 (Vote Required) shall be true and correct in all respects (except, in
the case of Section 3.6 for such inaccuracies as are de minimis in

shall be true and correct both when made and at and as of the Closing Date,
as if made at and as of such time (except to the extent expressly made as

the failure of such representations and warranties to be so true and correct
(without giving effect to any limitation as to "materiality" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect" set forth therein) does not have, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Parent shall have received a certificate of the
chief executive officer and the chief financial officer of the Company to
such effect.   (b) Performance of Obligations of the Company. The Company
shall have performed in all material respects and complied in all material
respects with all agreements and covenants required to be performed or

shall be deemed to be a reference to "more than 50%".   (f) All payments
under this Section 9.2 shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent.   (g) The Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 9.2 are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and are not
a penalty, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into
this Agreement. If the Company fails to pay promptly the fee due pursuant to
this Section 9.2, the Company will also pay to Parent Parent\'s
reasonable costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other
legal action, taken to collect payment, together with interest on the amount
of the unpaid fee under this Section 9.2, accruing from its due date, at an
