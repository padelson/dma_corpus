preparing its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December

contemplated hereby (the " _Estimated Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (ii) a
closing statement setting forth in reasonable detail a calculation, on the
basis of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet, of Assumed Liabilities (the "
_Estimated Assumed Liabilities_ ") and Closing Indebtedness (the items

preparing the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Documents and thereafter will

the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Documents. In the event that Purchaser
does not agree with the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Documents or any
portion thereof, Sellers shall consider any comments or changes proposed by
Purchaser in good faith and Sellers and Purchaser shall negotiate in good
faith to resolve the disputed items; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, none of the failure to include in the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet
Documents any comments or changes proposed by Purchaser, Purchasers
acceptance of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Documents, and the

the accuracy of the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet Documents or limit or
otherwise affect Purchasers rights and remedies under this Agreement,
including Purchasers right to include such comments or changes in the Final

(b) Not later than 90 days after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall deliver to
the Seller Representative (i) an unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Company and the Subsidiaries as of 12:01 AM (Pacific time) on the Closing
Date, prepared in accordance with (I) GAAP and (II) accounting policies
applied by the Company for purposes of preparing its consolidated financial
statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 (with any conflicts between
GAAP and the policies set forth in the preceding clause (II) to be resolved in
favor of GAAP), without reflecting any actual or anticipated adjustments or
effects arising from the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Final
Closing Balance Sheet_ "), and (ii) a closing statement setting forth in
reasonable detail a calculation, on the basis of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet, of Assumed Liabilities (the " _Final Assumed Liabilities_ ") (the items
specified in the preceding clauses (i) and (ii) collectively, the " _Final
Closing Balance Sheet Documents_ ").

 



 

(c) The Final Closing Balance Sheet Documents shall be subject to the Seller
Representatives review. In reviewing such items, the Seller Representative
shall have the right to review the work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents Purchaser prepared or reviewed in preparing the Final Closing
Balance Sheet Documents and thereafter will have

 



      
 

 



 

access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable advance notice, to
all relevant Books and Records, all to the extent the Seller Representative
reasonably requires them to complete its review of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet Documents. Within 30 days after its receipt of the Final Closing Balance
Sheet Documents, the Seller Representative shall notify Purchaser whether,
based on such review, it has any objections to the calculation of the Final
Assumed Liabilities (an " _Objection Notice_ "). Unless the Seller
Representative delivers to Purchaser within such 30-day period an Objection
Notice, the Final Assumed Liabilities shall be final and binding.

 



 

(d) If the Seller Representative delivers an Objection Notice, then (i) for 20
days after Purchaser receives such Objection Notice, Purchaser and the Seller
Representative shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree on the
calculation of the disputed amounts and (ii) lacking such agreement, the
matter shall be referred to an independent nationally-recognized accounting
firm as may be mutually agreed upon by Purchaser and the Seller Representative
(the " _Arbitrating Accountants_ "). The Arbitrating Accountants shall be
directed to render a written report to the Seller Representative and Purchaser
on the unresolved disputed items as soon as practicable (and in no event later
than thirty (30) days after submission of the dispute to the Arbitrating
Accountants), to resolve only those unresolved disputed items set forth in the
Objection Notice, not to make any determination of a disputed amount that is
outside the range of the proposed amounts submitted by Purchaser and the
Seller Representative, and to make any determinations solely in accordance
with the terms and provisions of this Agreement. If unresolved disputed items
are submitted to the Arbitrating Accountants, the Seller Representative and
Purchaser shall each furnish to the Arbitrating Accountants such work papers,
schedules and other documents and information relating to the unresolved
disputed items as the Arbitrating Accountants may reasonably request. The
determination of the Arbitrating Accountants shall be final and binding on
Purchaser and Sellers and not subject to collateral attack for any reason
other than manifest error or fraud. The Seller Representative and Purchaser
each agree to use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate
with the Arbitrating Accountants and to cause the Arbitrating Accountants to
resolve any dispute no later than thirty (30) days after submission of the
dispute to the Arbitrating Accountants in accordance with this Agreement. Of
the fees, costs and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountants, Purchaser, on the
one hand, and Sellers jointly and severally, on the other hand, shall bear a
fraction equal to (i) the absolute value of the difference between the Post-
Closing Adjustment that would have been payable based on the submission of
such party and the Post-Closing Adjustment based on the determination of the
Arbitrating Accountants _divided by_ (ii) the absolute value of the difference
between the Post-Closing Adjustment that would have been payable based on the
submission of Purchaser and the Post-Closing Adjustment that would have been
payable based on the submission of the Seller Representative. For illustrative
purposes only, should the Post-Closing Adjustment payable based on the
submission of Purchaser be $80, the Post-Closing Adjustment payable based on
the submission of the Seller Representative be $100 and the Post-Closing
Adjustment payable based on the determination of the Arbitrating Accountants
be $95, Purchase would bear 75% (($95  $80) / ($100 - $80)) and Sellers would
bear 25% (($100-$95) / ($100 - $80)) of the fees, costs and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountants.

 



 

(e) If the amount equal to the Estimated Assumed Liabilities _minus_ the Final
Assumed Liabilities as finally determined hereunder (the " _Post-Closing
Adjustment_ ") is greater than $0 (zero), then Purchaser shall pay to the
Seller Representative (for the benefit of Sellers) an

 



      
 

 



 

amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is
less than $0 (zero), then the Seller Representative shall (on behalf of
Sellers) pay to Purchaser an amount equal to the absolute value of the Post-
Closing Adjustment. Each payment under this Section 2.04(e) shall be made
within five Business Days after such final determination by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account specified by the recipient.

 



 

2.05 _Purchase Price Allocation_. Within sixty (60) days following the
Closing, the Seller Representative shall deliver to Purchaser a proposed
allocation of the Purchase Price (including any liabilities of the Company or
any Subsidiary that are properly taken into account for Tax purposes and any
payments to Sellers pursuant to _Section 14.04_) among the Assets and
Properties of the Company and the Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 1060
of the Code and Treasury Regulations thereunder (and any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law, as applicable). Purchaser shall have thirty (30)
days following receipt of Seller Representatives proposed allocation to
provide any changes or objections. If Purchaser objects in writing to Seller
Representatives proposed allocation within such thirty (30) day period, then
the parties shall cooperate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable
allocation. Any agreed allocation shall be binding on the parties, and each
Seller and Purchaser shall use such agreed allocation in connection with the
filing of all relevant U.S. federal, state and local income Tax Returns. If

purposes meaning such individual is and has been independent of the Seller and
has no interest in the Seller or any of its Affiliates other than solely by
reason of an interest in Purchaser) (as applicable, the " _Committee_ ").

admitted to do business and is in good standing in those jurisdictions
specified in _Section 3.02 of the Disclosure Schedule_, which are the only

Properties, or the conduct or nature of its business, makes such
qualification, licensing or admission necessary, except for those
jurisdictions in which the adverse effects of all such failures by the Company
to be qualified, licensed or admitted and in good standing could not in the
aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

benefits, contributions and premiums required by Sellers, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries and due under the terms of each Benefit Plan or applicable
Law have been timely made and paid in accordance with the terms of such

Benefit Plan, no event has occurred or, to the Knowledge of Sellers, is

Authority.

 



 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(h) of the Disclosure Schedule_,
neither the execution of the Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will, either alone or in combination with another event: (i)

Company or the Subsidiaries of any money or other property; (ii) accelerate
the vesting of or provide any additional rights or benefits (including funding
of compensation or benefits through a trust or otherwise) to any Company
Employee, director or consultant; or (iii) limit or restrict the ability of
Purchaser or its Affiliates to merge, amend or terminate any Benefit Plan.
Neither the execution of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will result in "excess parachute payments"
within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code or otherwise result in any
payments that would fail to be deductible under Section 280G of the Code.

 



 

(i) Except as set forth on _Section 3.12(i) of the Disclosure Schedule_, each
Benefit Plan can be terminated within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date
without payment of any additional contribution or amount and without creating
any unfunded or unaccrued liability or the vesting or acceleration of any
benefits promised by such Benefit Plan, except with respect to vesting as may
be required by law. Except as set forth on _Section 3.12(i) of the Disclosure
Schedule_, no action or omission of the Company or any Subsidiary, Benefit
Plan fiduciary, or any shareholder, director, officer, employee, or agent
thereof, and no Benefit Plan documentation or agreement, summary plan
description or other written communication distributed generally to employees,
in any way restricts, impairs or prohibits (whether legally binding or not)
the Company, any Subsidiary, Purchaser, Purchasers Affiliates or any
successor thereof from amending, merging, terminating or otherwise
discontinuing any Benefit Plan in accordance with the express terms of any
such plan and applicable law at or after Closing, except as required by law
and any such amendment, merger, termination or discontinuance may occur
without any liability to the Company, any Subsidiary or Purchaser or any
Affiliate of Purchaser.

 



      
 

 



 

(j) Except as set forth in _Section 3.12(j) of the Disclosure Schedule_, to
the Knowledge of Sellers, there is no transaction nor has there been any such
transaction in connection with the Company or any Subsidiary or any fiduciary
of any Benefit Plan which could be subject to either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to ERISA Section 502, a tax imposed by Code Section 4975 or
Liabilities for a breach of fiduciary responsibility under ERISA (including
liability through an indemnification agreement or policy), and, to the
Knowledge of Sellers, no basis for any such Liability exists, including, but
not limited to, any transaction in violation of ERISA Section 406(a) or (b) or
any "prohibited transaction" (as defined in Code Section 4975(c)(1)).

employees beneficiary association" within the meaning of Code Section
501(c)(9), a "welfare benefit fund" within the meaning of Code Section 419, a

in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing.
For a period of one year following Closing (or, if earlier, the date of
termination of the relevant employee), Purchaser shall, or shall cause its
Subsidiaries (including the Company) to, provide each employee of the Company
or its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing (the " _Company
Employees_ ") with (i) base compensation and annual cash bonus opportunities
that, in each case, are not less than the base compensation and annual cash
bonus opportunities that were provided to the applicable Company Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) all other compensation and employee
benefits (excluding any equity-based compensation, which shall be determined
by Purchasers Board of Managers in its sole discretion) that are not less
favorable in the aggregate than the other compensation and employee benefits
that were provided to the applicable Company Employee immediately prior to the
Closing.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For all purposes (including for purposes of vesting, eligibility to
participate and level of benefits) under the compensation and benefit plans,
programs, policies, contracts, agreements and arrangements of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries (including the Company) providing compensation or benefits to
any Company Employees after the Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), each Company
Employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
and its Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Closing, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Closing, to
credit for such service under any similar Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Closing; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not apply with respect to benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that its
application would result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same
period of service. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the

domestic partners shall be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent coverage under such New
Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately before the Closing (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Closing, and
Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his
or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plans
ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan.

contribution plans in which Company Employees shall be eligible to participate
after the Closing that is or are tax-qualified under applicable provisions of
the Code will accept eligible rollover distributions of the account balances
of Company Employees (in cash and, in the form of a direct rollover, loan
notes, if any, evidencing loans to such Company Employees as of the date of
distribution) from the Zuffa 401(k) Plan. Sellers shall take all actions
necessary to ensure that the Zuffa 401(k) Plan allows Company Employees to
rollover distributions of the account balances of the Company Employees (in
cash and in loan notes, if any, evidencing loans to such Company Employees as
of the date of distribution).

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.07_ or any other provision of this Agreement
shall (i) confer upon any Company Employee or any other Person any right to
continue in the employ or service of Sellers, Purchaser, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way
the rights of Sellers, Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee or any other Person at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause, except to the extent
expressly provided otherwise in a written agreement between Sellers,
Purchaser, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, and the
applicable

 



      
 

 



 

Person; (ii) be construed to establish, amend, or modify any compensation or
benefit plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or arrangement; or (iii)
limit the ability of Sellers, Purchaser, the Company or any of their
respective Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate in accordance with its
terms any compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement, contract, policy
or arrangement at any time adopted, assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, nothing in this _Section 7.07_ shall create any third-party
rights in any Person, including any current or former director, officer,
employee or other service provider of Sellers, Purchaser, the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, or any participant in any Benefit Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan, program, agreement, contract, policy or
arrangement (or any beneficiaries or dependents thereof).

 



 

(e) Immediately prior to the Closing Date, each employee who is a participant
in the Companys annual performance incentive plan or other bonus plan or
agreement shall be paid by the Company (less applicable withholdings) a pro-
rata portion of the employees (i) annual bonus awarded for the fiscal year in
which the Closing Date occurs and (ii) any other bonus as determined by the
Company, the performance period of which spans one or more years including the
fiscal year in which the Closing Date occurs, based on the number of days
elapsed in such fiscal year as of the Closing Date in the case of an annual
performance bonus, or the number of days elapsed in the performance period
prior to the Closing Date in the case of a multi-year arrangement. Any such
payments and the related obligation allocable to the pre-Closing period shall
not be a Liability of the Company following the Closing Date.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.07, in no event
shall the execution or performance of, or the exercise of any rights under,
any employment agreement entered into in accordance with Sections 8.08 and
9.08 hereof constitute, or result in, a breach of this Section 7.07.

ARTICLE X 
TAX MATTERS

 



 

10.01 _Tax Indemnity_. Sellers hereby agree, jointly and severally, to be
liable for and to indemnify Purchaser from and against (a) all Taxes of the
Company and each Subsidiary (or any predecessor thereof) for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period (determined as provided in Section 10.02); and (b) all Transfer
Taxes for which Sellers are responsible pursuant to Section 10.05.

 



 

10.02 _Allocations; Straddle Periods_. In the case of any Taxes other than
property and ad valorem Taxes, obligations shall be allocated to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period or the Post-Closing Tax Period, as applicable, by assuming
that the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period consisted of
two (2) taxable years or periods, one of which ended at the close of the
Closing Date and the other of which began at the beginning of the day
following the Closing Date and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or
credit shall be allocated between such two (2) taxable years or periods on a
"closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books were closed at the
close of the Closing Date. In the case of any property or ad valorem Taxes,
obligations shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-
Closing Tax Period based upon a fraction, the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the period ending on the close of the Closing Date, in the
case of an allocation to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or the number of calendar
days in the period beginning the day following the Closing Date and ending on
the last day of the period, in the case of an allocation to a Post-Closing Tax
Period, and in each case the denominator of which is the number of calendar
days in the entire period.

 



 

10.03 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Sellers, prepare (or
cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the Company and the Subsidiaries,
including IRS Form 1065, for each taxable year that ends on or prior to the
Closing Date (each a " _Seller Prepared Return_ "). Each Seller Prepared
Return shall be prepared in accordance with the past practices and customs of
the Company and the Subsidiaries except as otherwise required by Law. Subject
to the Seller Representatives prior written consent, neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary shall amend or file any Tax Return, or make any retroactive Tax
election, relating to any tax period ending on or before the Closing Date.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall, at the sole cost and expense of Purchaser, prepare (or
cause to be prepared) all Tax Returns of the Company and each Subsidiary for
each Straddle Period (each, a " _Shared Return_ "). Each Shared Return shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with past practices and customs of each
Company and Subsidiary and shall be delivered to the Seller Representative,
for the review and approval of the Seller Representative, at least ten (10)
days prior to the due date for such Tax Return (including any applicable
extensions). The Purchaser shall cause the Shared Return to incorporate any
changes reasonably requested by the Seller Representative that are consistent
with the past practices and customs of the Company and each Subsidiary, as
applicable. The Seller Representative and the Purchaser shall attempt in good
faith to resolve any disagreements regarding the Shared Returns subject to the
dispute resolution procedures of _Section 10.08_. In no event shall the
provision of comments by the Seller Representative prevent the Purchaser from
timely filing any Shared Return, subject to

 



      
 

 



 

amendment to reflect the resolution when rendered by the Arbitrating
Accountants. Any Pre-Closing Tax Obligations owed by Sellers on a Shared
Return shall be paid by Sellers to Purchaser by the due date of such Shared
Return.

 



 

10.04 _Cooperation_. After the Closing Date, Sellers and Purchaser shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party,
in connection with the preparation of all Tax Returns pursuant to this Article
X, in connection with any Tax investigation, audit or other proceeding and any
other matters relating to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention
and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information
that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return, investigation, audit or
other proceeding, and making employees available on a mutually convenient
basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material
provided hereunder.

 



 

10.05 _Transfer Taxes_. Each of Purchaser, on the one hand, and Sellers,
jointly and severally, on the other hand, shall pay 50% of all sales, use,
transfer, real property transfer, recording, gains, stock transfer and other
similar taxes and fees (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") arising out of or in connection
with the transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser shall
file all necessary documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer
Taxes, and Sellers shall cooperate in the preparation and filing of such Tax
Returns, including by joining in the execution of any such Tax Return and/or
providing documentation required to establish an exemption from Transfer Taxes
as required or allowed by law.

 



 

10.06 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax refunds that are received by Purchaser, the
Company or any Subsidiary, and any amounts credited against Taxes to which
Purchaser, the Company or any Subsidiary becomes entitled, in each case that
relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, shall be for the account of Sellers and
shall be forwarded by Purchaser to Sellers promptly following receipt, but in
no event later than fifteen (15) days after receipt or entitlement thereto,
_provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers shall not be entitled to any refund that
is attributable to the carryback of losses arising in or attributable to a
Post-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

10.07 _Tax Audits_.

 



 

(a) If notice of any judicial, administrative or arbitral actions, suits,
mediation, investigation, inquiry, proceedings or claims (including
counterclaims) by or before any Governmental or Regulatory Authority with
respect to Taxes of the Company or any Subsidiary (a " _Tax Claim_ ") shall be
received by any party for which another party would be liable pursuant to this
_Article X_, the notified party shall notify such other parties in writing of
such Tax Claim.

 



 

(b) The Seller Representative may elect, within 30 days of receiving such
notice, to direct any Tax Claim, at Sellers expense, that relates solely to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period (a " _Seller Tax Contest_ ") and to employ counsel of
its choice; _provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser shall have the right, at
its expense, to consult with the Seller Representative regarding such Seller
Tax Contest. Purchaser, at its expense, shall have the right to control all
other Tax Claims (each a " _Purchaser s Tax Contest_"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Seller Representative shall have the right, at its
expense, to consult with Purchaser regarding a Purchasers Tax Contest if
Sellers would be liable for a portion of the Taxes that may result from the
Purchasers Tax Contest; and _provided_ , _further_ , that Purchaser may not
agree to settle any such Purchasers Tax Contest

 



      
 

 



 

without the Seller Representatives prior written consent, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless the Purchaser
agrees to assume and become liable for all Taxes resulting from the
Purchasers Tax Contest. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of
this _Section 10.07_, on the one hand, and the provisions of _Section
12.02_, on the other, the provisions of this _Section 10.07_ shall control.

 



 

10.08 _Disputes_. Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of Section 14.14,
any dispute as to any matter covered under this Article X (a "Tax Dispute")
shall be resolved through binding arbitration administered by tax experts of
the Arbitrating Accountants. The place of the arbitration shall be Las Vegas,
Nevada and the arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The
Arbitrating Accountants shall be instructed to resolve the Tax Dispute and
such resolution shall be (A) set forth in writing and signed by the
Arbitrating Accountants, (B) delivered to each party involved in the Tax
Dispute as soon as practicable after the Tax Dispute is submitted to the
Arbitrating Accountants but no later than the fifteenth (15th) day after the
Arbitrating Accountants are instructed to resolve the Tax Dispute, (C) made in
accordance with this Agreement, and (D) final, binding and conclusive on the
parties involved in the Tax Dispute on the date of delivery of such
resolution. The Arbitrating Accountants shall only be authorized on any one
issue to decide in favor of and choose the position of either of the parties
involved in the Tax Dispute or to decide upon a compromise position between
the ranges presented by the Parties to the Arbitrating Accountants. The
Arbitrating Accountants shall base their decision solely upon the
presentations of the parties to the Arbitrating Accountants at a hearing held
before the Arbitrating Accountants and upon any materials made available by
either party and not upon independent review. The fees and expenses of the
Arbitrating Accountants shall be borne by Purchaser, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, in accordance with the principles set forth in the
last two sentences of _Section 2.04(d)_. Purchaser and Sellers shall keep the
decision of the Arbitrating Accountants confidential, except to the extent
required by Law or pursuant to disclosure of Tax Returns.

 



 

10.09 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. For federal, state and local Tax purposes,
any payments made under this Article X shall be treated by the Purchaser and
Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or pursuant to a good faith resolution of a Tax Claim.

 



 

ARTICLE XI 
SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES, 
COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

 



 

11.01 _Survival of Representations, Warranties, Covenants and Agreements_.
Notwithstanding any right of Purchaser (whether or not exercised) to
investigate the affairs of the Company and the Subsidiaries or any right of
any party (whether or not exercised) to investigate the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement,
Sellers and Purchaser have the right to rely fully upon the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements of the other contained in this Agreement.
Except as provided in the following sentence, each of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant
to this Agreement shall survive the Closing until the later of (x) the date
that is twelve (12) months after the Closing and (y) the date that is thirty
(30) days after Purchasers receipt of the report by its external auditors

 



      
 

 



 

on the audited balance sheets of Purchaser and its consolidated subsidiaries
(including the Company and the Subsidiaries) and the related audited
consolidated statements of operations, members equity and cash flow with
respect to the year ended December 31, 2016. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements of Sellers and
Purchaser contained in this Agreement will survive the Closing (a) until the
date that is eighteen (18) months after the Closing with respect to the
representations and warranties contained in _Section 3.12_; (b) indefinitely
with respect to (i) the representations and warranties contained in (A)
_Sections 3.02_ , _3.03_ , _3.05(b)_ , _3.23_ , _4.02_ , _4.03_ , _4.04(b)_
(the " _Company/Seller Fundamental Representations_ ") and (B) _Sections
5.02_ and _5.07_ (the " _Purchaser Fundamental Representations_ ") and (ii)
the covenants and agreements contained in _Sections 2.06_ and _14.04_ ; (c)
until sixty (60) days after the expiration of all applicable statutes of
limitation (including all periods of extension, whether automatic or
permissive) with respect to matters covered by _Sections 3.09_ and _Article
X_; (d) for six (6) months in the case of any covenant or agreement to be
performed in whole or in part on or prior to the Closing; or (e) with respect
to each other covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement, until sixty
(60) days following the last date on which such covenant or agreement is to be
performed or, if no such date is specified, indefinitely; _provided_ that any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement that would otherwise terminate
in accordance with clause (a), (c), (d) or (e) above will continue to survive
if a Claim Notice or Indemnity Notice (as applicable) shall have been timely
given under _Article XII_ on or prior to such termination date, until the
related claim for indemnification has been satisfied or otherwise resolved as
provided in _Article XII_. Following the expiration of a representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement as set forth above, no Action or Proceeding
may be initiated by any Purchaser Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified
Party with respect thereto, regardless of any statute of limitations period
that would otherwise apply.

 



 

ARTICLE XII 
INDEMNIFICATION

 



 

12.01 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) Subject to paragraphs (c) of this _Section 12.01_ and the other Sections
of this _Article XII_,

 



 

(i) each Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties in respect
of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any and all Losses
suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any of them becomes
subject, whether or not involving a third-party claim, directly or indirectly
resulting from, arising out of or relating to any breach of any representation
or warranty made by such Seller; and

 



 

(ii) Sellers shall, jointly and severally, indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified
Parties in respect of, and hold each of them harmless from and against, any
and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained by any of them or to which any
of them becomes subject, whether or not involving a third-party claim,
directly or indirectly resulting from, arising out of or relating to (A) any
breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this
Agreement, (B) nonfulfillment of or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement on the part of Sellers contained in this Agreement, (C) the Excluded
Assets, including all obligations and liabilities related thereto or (D) the
matters set forth in _Section 3.08 of the Disclosure Schedule_.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Subject to the other Sections of this _Article XII_, Purchaser shall
indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties in respect of, and hold each of them
harmless from and against, any and all Losses suffered, incurred or sustained
by any of them or to which any of them becomes subject, resulting from,
arising out of or relating to (i) any breach of representation or warranty
made by Purchaser in this Agreement or (ii) nonfulfillment of or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Purchaser contained in this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 12.01_, Sellers
shall have no obligation to indemnify any Purchaser Indemnified Parties
pursuant to _Section 12.01(a)(ii)(A)_ (i) unless and until such time as the
aggregate amount of all Losses suffered by, imposed on or incurred by the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties exceeds an amount equal to Four Million Dollars
($4,000,000) (the " _Threshold_ "), and then only for such excess, or (ii) for
any claim or series of related claims for which the Losses aggregate less than
One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000) (the " _Basket_ ") ( _provided_
, if such Losses do aggregate to or exceed such amount, the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for the entire
aggregate amount of such Losses, irrespective of the Basket but subject to the
Threshold); _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) neither the Threshold nor the
Basket shall apply to Losses arising from any breach of any Company/Seller
Fundamental Representation or of any of those representations and warranties
set forth in _Section 3.08_ or _3.09_ or in the case of fraud or criminal or
willful misconduct, (B) the cumulative aggregate indemnity obligations of
Sellers under _Section 12.01(a)(ii)(A)_ with respect to representations and
warranties other than (x) the Company/Seller Fundamental Representations, (y)
any representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.08_ or _3.09_ , or
(z) in the case of fraud or criminal or willful misconduct shall in no event
exceed Forty Six Million Dollars ($46,000,000), and (C) the cumulative
aggregate indemnity obligations of Sellers under _Section 12.01(a)(i)_ or
_12.01(a)(ii)(A)_ with respect to the Company/Seller Fundamental
Representations or any representations and warranties set forth in _Section
3.08_ or _3.09_ shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price (determined
without regard to _Section 12.04_), other than in the case of fraud or
criminal or willful misconduct.

 



 

(d) The indemnification obligation of any particular Seller for Losses arising
under _Section 12.01(a)(i)_ or _12.01(a)(ii)(A)_ shall not, other than in
the case of fraud or criminal or willful misconduct of such Seller, exceed
such Sellers allocable portion of the Purchase Price. The indemnification
obligation of any Purchaser for Losses arising under _Section 12.01(b)(i)_
shall not, other than in the case of fraud or criminal or willful misconduct
of Purchaser, exceed the Purchase Price (determined without regard to _Section
12.04_).

 



 

(e) No Seller shall have, and no Seller shall exercise or assert (or attempt
to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, reimbursement, subrogation
or indemnity against the Company or any Subsidiary in connection with any
indemnification obligation to which such Seller may become subject pursuant to
this Agreement. From and after the Closing Date, Sellers hereby irrevocably
waive and release the Company and each Subsidiary from any such right of
contribution, reimbursement, subrogation or indemnity.

 



 

(f) For purposes of determining the occurrence of a breach of a representation
or warranty or the amount of any Losses under this _Section 12.01_, any
materiality qualifiers (including Company Material Adverse Effect), or
monetary thresholds to similar effect contained

 



      
 

 



 

in the applicable representation and warranty shall be deemed to be deleted
and shall be given no force or effect.

 



 

12.02 _Method of Asserting Claims_. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party under _Section 12.01_ will be asserted and resolved as
follows:

 



 

(a) In the event any claim or demand in respect of which an Indemnified Party
might seek indemnity under _Section 12.01_ is asserted against or sought to
be collected from such Indemnified Party by a Person other than Sellers or any
Affiliate of Sellers or of Purchaser (a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the
Indemnified Party shall deliver a Claim Notice with reasonable promptness to
the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to provide the Claim
Notice with reasonable promptness after the Indemnified Party receives notice
of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be obligated to
indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such Third Party Claim to the
extent that the Indemnifying Partys ability to defend has been irreparably
prejudiced by such failure of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party
will notify the Indemnified Party as soon as practicable whether the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under
_Section 12.01_ and whether the Indemnifying Party desires, at its sole cost
and expense, to defend the Indemnified Party against such Third Party Claim.
The Indemnifying Party will be entitled to participate in such Third Party
Claim and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the indemnifying party is
also a party to such Third Party Claim and the Indemnified Party determines in
good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate, or (ii) the
Indemnifying Party fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified
Party of its financial capacity to defend such Third Party Claim and provide
indemnification with respect to such Third Party Claim), to assume the defense
of such Third Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
and, after notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of its
election to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying
Party will not, as long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to
the Indemnified Party under _Section 12.01_ for any fees of other counsel or
any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third Party Claim, in
each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party will have
fifteen (15) days from receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim from an
Indemnified Party to assume the defense thereof. The Indemnifying Party shall
keep the Indemnified Party reasonably informed of the status of defense.

 



 

(b) Subject to _Section 12.02(c)_, in the event any Indemnified Party should
have a claim under _Section 12.01_ against any Indemnifying Party that does
not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver an
Indemnity Notice with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying Party. The
failure by any Indemnified Party to give the Indemnity Notice shall not impair
such partys rights hereunder except to the extent that an Indemnifying Party
demonstrates that it has been irreparably prejudiced thereby. If the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party that it does not dispute the
claim described in such Indemnity Notice or fails to notify the Indemnified
Party within thirty (30) days following receipt of such Indemnity Notice
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the claim described in such Indemnity
Notice, the Loss arising from the claim specified in such Indemnity Notice
will be conclusively deemed a liability of the Indemnifying Party under
_Section 12.01_ and the Indemnifying Party shall pay the amount of such Loss
to the Indemnified Party on demand following the final determination thereof.
If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to
such claim, the

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party will proceed in good faith to
negotiate a resolution of such dispute.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 12.02(b)_ to the contrary but
without limiting the rights of any Purchaser Indemnified Party under _Section
12.02(a)_ with respect to Third Party Claims, the determination of whether any
Purchaser Indemnified Party makes any claim or demand for indemnification
under _Section 12.01(a)(i)_ that is based on any disclosures set forth in the
Seller Certificates shall be vested exclusively in the Committee. The
Committee shall have sole authority to determine whether any Purchaser
Indemnified Party shall assert any such indemnification claim and, in making
such determination, may be assisted by independent legal and financial
advisors of its choosing, the costs of which shall be borne by Purchaser and
shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of indemnifiable
Losses, if any.

 



 

12.03 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each Seller, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, hereby releases and discharges the Company and each
Subsidiary, and each of Representatives of any of the foregoing, from any and
all Liabilities arising in respect of any period ending on or prior to the
Closing other than any Liabilities (a) arising under this Agreement or (b) in
respect of indemnification rights specified in _Section 7.04_.

 



 

12.04 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. For federal, state and local Tax purposes,
any payments made under this _Article XII_ shall be treated by the Purchaser
and Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or pursuant to the good faith resolution of a Tax
Claim.

 



 

ARTICLE XIII 
TERMINATION

 



 

13.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated, and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned:

 



 

(a) at any time before the Closing, by mutual written agreement of the Seller
Representative on behalf of Sellers and Purchaser;

 



 

(b) at any time before the Closing, by the Seller Representative on behalf of
Sellers or Purchaser, in the event (i) of a material breach hereof by the non-
terminating party if such non-terminating party fails to cure such breach
within twenty (20) Business Days following notification thereof by the
terminating party or (ii) upon notification of the non-terminating party by
the terminating party that the satisfaction of any condition to the
terminating partys obligations under this Agreement becomes impossible or
impracticable with the use of commercially reasonable efforts if the failure
of such condition to be satisfied is not caused by a breach hereof by the
terminating party;

 



 

(c) at any time before the Closing, by the Seller Representative on behalf of
Sellers or by Purchaser, in the event that any Order or Law becomes effective
restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, upon
notification of the non-terminating party by the terminating party;

 



      
 

 



 

(d) at any time after May 31, 2016 (the " _Termination Date_ ") by the Seller
Representative or Purchaser upon notification of the non-terminating party by
the terminating party if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before such
date and such failure to consummate is not caused by a breach of this
Agreement by the terminating party; _provided_ , that if all of the conditions
to Closing shall have been satisfied, shall be capable of being satisfied at
such time or would be capable of being satisfied at such time but for the fact
that the conditions set forth in _Sections 8.05_ , _8.07_ and _9.05_ are not
satisfied, the Termination Date may be extended by Purchaser or the Seller
Representative from time to time by written notice to the other to a date not
later than July 31, 2016; or

 



 

(e) at any time prior to commencement of the "roadshow" to be conducted for
purposes of the IPO Transactions, by Purchaser, in the event that (i) any
Seller fails to timely deliver a Pre-Roadshow Bring Down Certificate in
accordance with _Section 13.03_, or (ii) any Pre-Roadshow Bring Down
Certificate delivered to Purchaser fails to make the Preliminary Confirmations
without qualification thereof or exception thereto.

 



 

13.02 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to _Section 13.01_, this Agreement will forthwith become null and
void, and there will be no liability or obligation (other than any liabilities
or obligations resulting from fraud or criminal or willful misconduct) on the
part of Sellers or Purchaser (or any of their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents or other representatives or Affiliates), except that the
provisions with respect to expenses in _Section 14.04_ and confidentiality in
_Section 14.05_ will continue to apply following any such termination.

Sellers for the out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation, execution and closing of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby; _provided_ , that Purchaser shall not, directly or
indirectly, bear, pay or reimburse any fees and expenses or portion thereof in
respect of any premium, bonus, success or similar non-standard and non-hourly-
based consideration for legal or accounting services.

 



 

14.05 _Public Announcements_. At all times at or before the Closing, Sellers
and Purchaser will not, and Sellers will cause the Company not to, issue or
make any reports, statements or releases to the public with respect to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the consent of the
other, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; _provided_ , that
Purchaser may include a summary description of this Agreement in the
prospectus included in the registration statement filed in connection with the
IPO Transactions and file a copy of this Agreement with the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission. Subject to the foregoing proviso, if either party is
unable to obtain the approval of its public report, statement or release from
the other party and such report, statement or release is, in the opinion of
legal counsel to such party, required by Law in order to discharge such
partys disclosure obligations, then such party may make or issue the legally
required report, statement or release and promptly furnish the other party
with a copy thereof. Sellers and Purchaser will also obtain the other partys
prior approval of any press release to be issued immediately following the
Closing announcing the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

14.06 _Confidentiality_ Each party hereto will hold, and will use its best
efforts to cause its Affiliates, and in the case of Purchaser, any Person who
has provided, or who is considering providing, financing to Purchaser to
finance all or any portion of the Purchase Price or who is providing or
considering providing underwriting services in connection with the IPO
Transactions, and their respective Representatives to hold, in strict
confidence from any Person (other than any such Affiliate, Representative, or
Person who has provided, or who is considering providing, financing or
underwriting services), unless (i) compelled to disclose by judicial or
administrative process (including without limitation in connection with
obtaining the necessary approvals of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby of Governmental or Regulatory Authorities) or by other
requirements of Law or (ii) disclosed in an Action or Proceeding brought by a
party hereto in pursuit of its rights or in the exercise of its remedies
hereunder, all documents and information concerning the other party or any of
its Affiliates furnished to it by the other party or such other partys
Representatives in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, except to the extent that such documents or information
can be shown to have been (a) previously known by the party receiving such
documents or information, (b) in the public domain (either prior to or after
the furnishing of such documents or information hereunder) through no fault of
such receiving party or (c) later acquired by the receiving party from another
source if the receiving party is not aware that such source is under an
obligation to another party hereto to keep such documents and information
confidential; _provided_ that following the Closing the foregoing restrictions
will not apply to Purchasers use of documents and information concerning the
Company and the Subsidiaries furnished by Sellers hereunder. In the event the
transactions contemplated hereby are not consummated, upon the request of the
other party, each party hereto will, and will cause its Affiliates, any Person
who has provided, or who is considering providing, financing to such party and
their respective Representatives to, promptly (and in no event later than five
(5) Business Days after such request) redeliver or cause to be redelivered all
copies of documents

 



       
 

 



 

and information furnished by the other party in connection with this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and destroy or cause to be destroyed
all notes, memoranda, summaries, analyses, compilations and other writings
related thereto or based thereon prepared by the party furnished such
documents and information or its Representatives.

 



 

14.07 _Waiver_. Any term or condition of this Agreement may be waived at any
time by the party that is entitled to the benefit thereof, but no such waiver
shall be effective unless set forth in a written instrument duly executed by
or on behalf of the party waiving such term or condition. No waiver by any
party of any term or condition of this Agreement, in any one or more
instances, shall be deemed to be or construed as a waiver of the same or any
other term or condition of this Agreement on any future occasion. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by Law or otherwise afforded, will be
cumulative and not alternative.

 



 

14.08 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, supplemented or modified
only by a written instrument duly executed by or on behalf of each party
hereto; provided, however, that no amendment or other modification may be made
to this Agreement that has the effect of waiving or otherwise altering the
overall effect of _Sections 8.06(b)_ or _9.06(b)_ without the prior written
approval of the Lender Directors.

 



 

14.09 _No Third-Party Beneficiary_. The terms and provisions of this Agreement
are intended solely for the benefit of each party hereto and their respective
successors or permitted assigns, and it is not the intention of the parties to
confer third-party beneficiary rights upon any other Person other than any
Person entitled to indemnity under _Article XII_, except that the Lender
Directors shall be third-party beneficiaries with a right of enforcement only
of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.06(b)_ and _9.06(b)_.

 



 

14.10 _No Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any right,
interest or obligation hereunder may be assigned by any party hereto without
the prior written consent of the other party hereto and any attempt to do so
will be void, except (a) for assignments and transfers by operation of Law and
(b) that Purchaser may assign any or all of its rights, interests and
obligations hereunder (including without limitation its rights under _Article
XI_) to (i) a wholly-owned subsidiary, provided that any such subsidiary
agrees in writing to be bound by all of the terms, conditions and provisions
contained herein, (ii) any post-Closing purchaser of all of the issued and
outstanding membership interests of the Company or a substantial part of its
assets or (iii) any financial institution providing purchase money or other
financing to Purchaser or the Company from time to time as collateral security
for such financing, but no such assignment referred to in clause (i) or (ii)
shall relieve Purchaser of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding
sentence, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is
enforceable by the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

 



 

14.11 _Headings; Schedules_. The headings used in this Agreement have been
inserted for convenience of reference only and do not define or limit the
provisions hereof. Each exception to the any representation or warranty
disclosed on one section of the Disclosure Schedule shall constitute an
exception to all other applicable representations and warranties

 



      
 

 



 

made in this Agreement requiring disclosure of such exception to the extent
that such exception is reasonably apparently from a plain reading of the
disclosure contained in such section.

 



 

14.12 _Invalid Provisions_. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
illegal, invalid or unenforceable under any present or future Law, and if the
rights or obligations of any party hereto under this Agreement will not be
materially and adversely affected thereby, (a) such provision will be fully
severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force
and effect and will not be affected by the illegal, invalid or unenforceable
provision or by its severance herefrom.

 



 

14.13 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to a Contract
executed and performed in such State, without giving effect to the conflicts
of laws principles thereof.

 



 

14.14 _Disputes_. Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating
to this Agreement that cannot be resolved amicably by the parties, including
the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined
by binding arbitration pursuant to Section 349 of the Rules of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware if it is eligible for such arbitration. If
the dispute claim or controversy is not eligible for such arbitration, it
shall be settled by arbitration administered by the American Arbitration
Association (" _AAA_ ") in accordance with its Commercial Rules and judgment
on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. Any AAA arbitration proceeding shall be conducted in the
State of Delaware. The AAA arbitrator shall have the authority to award any
remedy or relief that a court of competent jurisdiction could order or grant,
including the issuance of an injunction or other equitable relief. However,
any party may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to
any court having jurisdiction hereof and seek interim provisional, injunctive
or other equitable relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the
controversy is otherwise resolved. Except as necessary in court proceedings to
enforce this arbitration provision or an award rendered hereunder, or to
obtain interim relief, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the
existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior
written consent of both parties. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT OF TRIAL BY JURY IN
ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTER-CLAIM, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH
THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY MATTER ARISING HEREUNDER.

 



 

14.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same instrument.

 



 

14.16 _Seller Representative_. Each Seller, by the execution of this
Agreement, shall be deemed to have irrevocably appointed, authorized and
directed Frank J. Fertitta III, in his capacity as the Seller Representative,
to act as such Sellers agent, representative, proxy and attorney-in-fact for
the purpose of effecting the consummation of the

 



      
 

 



 

transactions contemplated by this Agreement and exercising, on behalf of all
Sellers, the rights and powers of Sellers hereunder and thereunder. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller Representative shall have
full power and authority, and is hereby directed, for and on behalf of all
Sellers, to take such action, and to exercise such rights, power and
authority, as are authorized, delegated and granted to the Seller
Representative hereunder in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby and to exercise such rights, power and authority as are incidental
thereto, to represent any Seller at and after the Closing, to give or receive
any notices required or permitted to be given hereunder and thereunder, to
accept service of process on behalf of any Seller, to execute and deliver, or
hold in escrow and release, any exhibits or amendments to this Agreement, or
any other agreements, certificates, statements, notices, approvals, extensions
or waivers relating to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, to
conduct or cease to conduct the defense of all claims against any Seller in
connection with this Agreement, and to settle all such claims on behalf of all
Sellers. The appointment and agency created hereby is irrevocable, and shall
be deemed to be coupled with an interest. The Seller Representative shall
serve as such from the date hereof until the earlier of his resignation, death
or incapacity or the completion of his obligations hereunder. In the event
that Frank J. Fertitta III is unable or unwilling to continue to serve as the
Seller Representative, or otherwise ceases to be Sellers Representative, his
successor shall be promptly appointed by Sellers.
