_Agreement_ "), is by and among **Siemens Corporation** , a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), **Belfast Merger Co.** , a Delaware corporation
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Purchaser_ "), and **Dade Behring
Holdings, Inc.** , a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").  All
capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings
ascribed thereto in Section 9.03.

  

 **W I T N E S S E T H:**

  

 **WHEREAS,** the respective boards of directors of Parent, Purchaser and the
Company each have determined that it is in the best interests of their
respective stockholders for Parent to acquire the Company upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  

 **WHEREAS,** in furtherance of such acquisition, it is proposed that
Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, make a cash tender
offer (the " _Offer_ ") to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares
(the " _Shares_ ") of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company
(the " _Company Common Stock_ "), including the rights attached thereto (the
" _Rights_ ") pursuant to the Rights Agreement, dated as of October 1, 2002
(as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time, the "
_Company Rights Agreement_ "), between the Company and Mellon Investor
Services LLC, as rights agent, at a price per Share of Seventy-Seven Dollars
($77.00) (such amount, or any greater amount per Share paid pursuant to the
Offer, being the " _Per Share Amount_ ") net to the seller in cash, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  

 **WHEREAS,** following the consummation of the Offer, Purchaser will merge
with and into the Company in accordance with the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), with the Company continuing as the
surviving corporation in the merger (the " _Merger_ "), and each Share that
is not tendered and accepted pursuant to the Offer (other than (x) any Shares
held in the treasury of the Company or owned by Purchaser, Parent or any
direct or indirect subsidiary of Parent, Purchaser or the Company and (y) any
Dissenting Shares) will thereupon be cancelled and converted into the right
to receive cash in an amount equal to the Per Share Amount, upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth herein;

  

 **WHEREAS,** the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ")
has unanimously approved the making of the Offer, determined that this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer and
the Merger, are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the holders
of Shares and resolved to recommend that holders of Shares tender their
Shares pursuant to the Offer, and, if required by Delaware Law, adopt this
Agreement in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL; and

  

 **WHEREAS,** the boards of directors of Parent, Purchaser and the Company
each have approved and adopted this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger.

  

 **NOW, THEREFORE,** in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
covenants and agreements herein contained, and intending to be legally bound,
Parent, Purchaser and the Company hereby agree as follows:     

# **ARTICLE I 
  
 THE OFFER**

  

## Section 1.01 _The Offe_ r.

  

### (a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the " _Exchange Act_ ")), the Offer to
purchase all of the outstanding Shares at a price per Share equal to the Per
Share Amount (as adjusted as provided in Section 1.03, if applicable) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof (and in any event
within ten (10) Business Days of the date hereof) and in compliance with
Section 14(d) and Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and all other applicable
Laws.

  

### (b) _Payment_. Subject solely to the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by this Agreement) of each of the conditions set forth in
_Annex A_ hereto (the " _Offer Conditions_ ") and the other provisions of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to,
consummate the Offer in accordance with its terms and accept for payment and
pay for all Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer as promptly as practicable after the applicable expiration date of the
Offer (as it may be extended in accordance with Section 1.01(d)) and in any
event in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The Per Share
Amount payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer or any subsequent offering period contemplated by
Section 1.01(e) shall be paid net to the holder thereof in cash, subject to
reduction only for any applicable federal back-up withholding or other taxes
payable by such holder. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence
and subject to the applicable rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission (the " _SEC_ ") and the terms and conditions of the Offer,
Purchaser expressly reserves the right to delay payment for Shares in order
to comply in whole or in part with applicable Laws. Any such delay shall be
effected in compliance with Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act.
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Purchaser on a timely basis
the funds necessary to purchase all Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated
to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  

### (c) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligation of Purchaser to
accept for payment Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer shall be subject solely to the satisfaction of the Offer Conditions.
Purchaser may waive any Offer Condition, increase the Per Share Amount
payable in the Offer and make any other changes in the terms and conditions
of the Offer; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, without the prior written
consent of the Company, Purchaser shall not, and Parent shall not permit
Purchaser to, (i) subject to Section 1.03, decrease the Per Share Amount or
change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (ii) reduce the number
of Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iii) amend, change or
impose conditions to the Offer other than the Offer Conditions, (iv) amend,
or waive satisfaction of, the Minimum Condition, or (v) amend or change
any term or condition of the Offer in a manner adverse to the holders of the
Shares.

  

### (d) _Expiration of the Offer_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, cause
the Offer to remain open,

        

### unless extended as provided below, until midnight, New York Time, on the

in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after

under the Exchange Act). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to, extend or re-extend the Offer for successive extension
periods of up to fifteen (15) business days (for this purpose calculated in

then scheduled expiration date until such time as the Offer Conditions are
satisfied or waived, and (ii) Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause
Purchaser to, extend or re-extend the Offer for any period required by any
Governmental Authority or any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of
the SEC or the staff thereof or the NASDAQ applicable to the Offer;

(ii) of this Section 1.01(d), in no event shall Purchaser be required to
extend the Offer beyond the Termination Date, and (iii) Purchaser may provide
for a subsequent offering period (and one or more extensions thereof) in

payment, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly
terminate the Offer without accepting any Shares for payment.

  

### (e) _Subsequent Offering Period_. If on the date the Offer expires, the
Minimum Condition has been satisfied, or with the consent of the Company,
waived, and all other Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived, and,
upon the acceptance of Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer, Parent, Purchaser and their respective affiliates would not own at
least 90% of the issued and outstanding Shares, Purchaser may provide for a
subsequent offering period within the meaning of, and in compliance
with, Rule 14d-11 promulgated under the Exchange Act and all other provisions
of applicable securities laws (the " _Subsequent Offering Period_ ") of
not less than three (3) nor more than twenty (20) business days (for this
purpose calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under the
Exchange Act) immediately following the expiration of the Offer. Parent and
Purchaser shall cause the Offer Documents to reserve the right of Purchaser
to provide for the Subsequent Offering Period. During the
Subsequent Offering Period, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser
to, immediately accept for payment and promptly pay for all Shares as they
are tendered pursuant to the Offer during the Subsequent Offering Period

the Offer Documents to be disseminated to all holders of
Shares (collectively, the " _Company Stockholders_ "). Parent and Purchaser

### cause the Schedule TO to comply in all material respects with
the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and all other applicable Laws.  Parent and Purchaser
hereby further agree that the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, when filed

and addresses of all record holders of Shares and with security position

to the extent available, such information with respect to persons becoming

including updated listings and computer files of stockholders, mailing labels
and security position listings, and such other assistance in disseminating
the Offer Documents to holders of Shares as Parent or Purchaser may

to):

        

### (i) hold in confidence the information contemplated by this
Section 1.02(c) and all extracts and summaries thereof on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and use
such information only for purposes of consummating the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (ii) if this Agreement shall be terminated, deliver
to the Company or destroy, and, upon the Companys request, provide the
Company with a certificate of such destruction signed by an officer of each
of Parent and Purchaser, all copies of such information then in their or
their Representatives possession or control.

  

## Section 1.03 _Adjustment to Per Share Amount_. The Per Share Amount shall
be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to Company Common Stock occurring on
or after the date hereof and prior to Purchasers acceptance for payment of
and payment for Shares pursuant to the Offer.

  

## Section 1.04 _Top-Up Option_.

  

### (a) Subject to Section 1.04(b) and Section 1.04(c), the Company grants to
Purchaser a non-assignable option (the " _Top-Up Option_ ") to purchase from
the Company the number of newly-issued shares of Company Common Stock equal
to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to
the number of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Purchaser or
any of their wholly-owned subsidiaries at the time of exercise of the Top-Up
Option, constitutes 90.01% of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
that would be outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares of
Company Common Stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required to issue any
shares pursuant to the Top-Up Option if (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock otherwise to be issued thereunder exceeds the aggregate number
of shares of Company Common Stock that the Company is authorized to issue
under its certificate of incorporation but that are not issued and
outstanding (and are not subscribed for or otherwise committed to be issued)
at the time of the closing of the purchase of Shares pursuant to the Top-Up
Option, (ii) a provision of any applicable Law, including the rules and
regulations of NASDAQ, shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or
the delivery of the shares to be purchased thereunder in respect of such
exercise, or (iii) Parent has not accepted for payment and paid for all
Shares validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

  

### (b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Purchaser at any time at
or after the Acceptance Time, so long as the total number of shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Purchaser or any of
their wholly-owned Subsidiaries constitutes at least eighty percent (80%) of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding. The aggregate
purchase price payable for the shares of Company Common Stock being purchased
by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be determined by multiplying
the number of such shares by the Per Share Amount. Such purchase price may
be paid by Purchaser, at its election, either entirely in cash or by paying
in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate par value of
such shares and by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note
having a principal amount equal to the balance of such purchase price. Any
such promissory note shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum, shall
mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery
of such promissory note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty.

        

### (c) In the event Purchaser shall exercise the Top-Up Option,
Purchaser shall deliver to the Company a written notice setting forth (i) the
number of shares of Company Common Stock that Purchaser intends to purchase
pursuant to the Top-Up Option, and (ii) the manner in which Purchaser intends
to pay the applicable exercise price. The closing of the purchase of shares
of Company Common Stock by Purchaser pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall take
place at the Closing.  At the closing of the purchase of such shares of
Company Common Stock, Purchaser shall cause to be delivered to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for such shares, and
the Company shall cause to be issued to Purchaser a certificate representing
such shares.

  

## Section 1.05 _Company Board Representation; Section 14(f)_.

  

### (a) _Composition of Company Board and Board Committees_. Upon the
acceptance for purchase by Purchaser of Shares pursuant to the Offer (the "
_Acceptance Time_ ") and from time to time thereafter, Purchaser shall be
entitled to designate up to such number of directors (rounded up to the next
whole number) on the Company Board as shall give Purchaser representation on
the Company Board equal to the product of the total number of directors on
the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or appointed
pursuant to this Section 1.05(a)) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Purchaser or any affiliate
of Purchaser following such purchase bears to the total number of Shares then
outstanding, and the Company shall promptly thereafter use its best efforts
to cause Purchasers designees to be elected or appointed as directors of the
Company, including by increasing the size of the Company Board or securing
the resignations of incumbent directors, or both as necessary. From time to
time after the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all action necessary
to cause the individuals so designated by Purchaser to constitute
substantially the same percentage (rounding up where appropriate) as is on
the Company Board of each committee of the Company Board to the fullest
extent permitted by all applicable Law and the rules of NASDAQ.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, following the purchase by Purchaser of Shares
pursuant to the Offer and before the Effective Time, in the event that
Purchasers designees are elected or appointed to the Company Board pursuant
to this Section 1.05(a), the Company Board shall have at least such number of
directors as may be required by the rules of NASDAQ or the federal securities
Laws who are considered independent directors within the meaning of such
rules and Laws (" _Independent Directors_ "); _provided_ that, in such event,
if the number of Independent Directors shall be reduced below the number of
directors as may be required by such rules and regulations for any reason
whatsoever (including, with respect to the rules of NASDAQ, such rules
governing the requirements for the continued listing of the Shares) the
remaining Independent Director(s) shall designate persons to fill such
vacancies and such designees shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for
purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director then remains,
the other directors shall designate such number of directors as may be
required by the rules of NASDAQ and the federal securities laws, to fill such
vacancies who shall not be employees, directors, stockholders or other
affiliates of Parent or Purchaser, and such designees shall be deemed to be
Independent Directors for purposes of this Agreement.

  

### (b) _Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act_. The Companys obligation to
appoint Purchasers designees to the Company Board pursuant to Section
1.05(a) shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall

        

### take all actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder to fulfill its obligations under this
Section 1.05 prior to the Acceptance Time and shall include in the Schedule
14D-9 such information with respect to the Company and its officers and
directors as is required under Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 to fulfill
such obligations. Parent or Purchaser shall supply to the Company, and be
solely responsible for, any information with respect to either of them and
their nominees, officers, directors and affiliates required by such Section
14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated thereunder.

  

### (c) _Required Approvals of Independent Directors_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, following the
appointment or election of designees of Purchaser pursuant to Section 1.05(a)
and prior to the Effective Time, any (i) amendment of this Agreement or the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of the Company or any Subsidiary,
(ii) termination of this Agreement by the Company, (iii) extension by the
Company of the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of Parent or Purchaser hereunder, (iv) recommendation to the Company
Stockholders or any modification or withdrawal of any such recommendation in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (v)
exercise or waiver of any of the Companys rights hereunder, or (vi)
amendment, rescission, repeal or waiver of the certificate of incorporation
or by-laws of the Company, in each case, shall require the approval of a
majority of the Independent Directors.

#### Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.10 (or as

without payment of the applicable exercise price, an amount of cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by (ii) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share
of such Company Stock Option (with the aggregate amount of such payment to
the holder to be rounded to the nearest cent), less applicable withholding
taxes, if any, required to be withheld with respect to such payment. No
holder of a Company Stock Option that has an exercise price per Share that is
equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to any
payment with respect to such option before or after the Effective Time.

  

## Section 2.09 _Dissenting Shares_.

demanded properly their statutory rights of appraisal in respect of
such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into,
or represent the right to receive, the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.07(a)(i). Such stockholders shall be

        

### entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting
Shares held by them in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL, except that all Dissenting Shares held by stockholders who shall have
failed to perfect or who effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their
rights to appraisal of such Dissenting Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into, and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without any interest thereon, upon surrender of the
certificate or certificates that formerly evidenced such Dissenting Shares in
the manner provided in Section 2.10 (or as otherwise provided in Section
2.10).

  

### (b) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal received by the Company, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating

## Section 2.10 _Surrender of Shares; Stock Transfer Books_.

  

### (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Acceptance Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying
agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the holders of Shares to receive the funds
to which holders of Shares shall become entitled pursuant to the Merger and
shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent to provide for the
foregoing on terms reasonably acceptable to the Company.

  

### (b) _Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit
(or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for payment to the holders
of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of Section
2.07(a), an amount of cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (x)
the Merger Consideration and (y) the aggregate number of shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(excluding shares cancelled pursuant to Section 2.07(a)(ii) and Dissenting
Shares), and upon request of the Paying Agent from time to time thereafter
shall promptly deposit such additional cash amounts as are necessary to make
the payments contemplated hereby (such cash amounts collectively being
referred to herein as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (x) the terms and conditions of the investment shall be such as to
permit the Paying Agent to make prompt payment of the Merger Consideration as
necessary and (y) any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such investments will be payable to Parent, and Parent shall
promptly, upon notice by the Paying Agent, deposit with the Paying Agent the
amount of any net loss resulting from or produced by such investments.

  

### (c) _Payment Procedures_.  Promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to cause to be mailed to each person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07(a)(i) (x) a form of letter of
transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery
shall be

        

### effected, and risk of loss and title to the certificates evidencing such
Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent) and (y) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal.
Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required
pursuant to such instructions or as may be reasonably required by the Paying
Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof for
each Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate shall
then be cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender of any Certificate for the benefit
of the holder of such Certificate. Until so surrendered,
outstanding Certificates shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time to
evidence only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to the provisions of Section 2.07(a).  If a payment
of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing Shares is
registered on the stock transfer books of the Company, it shall be
a condition of payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other taxes
required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall
have established to the reasonable satisfaction of Purchaser that such taxes
either have been paid or are not applicable. If any holder of Shares
immediately prior to the Effective Time is unable to surrender
the Certificate pursuant to which such Shares are evidenced, whether because
such Certificate has been lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed or otherwise,
the Paying Agent or Parent, as applicable, shall issue in exchange for
such Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.07(a) if such holder delivers, in lieu of such Certificate,
if requested by Parent, an affidavit and/or an indemnity bond in form
and substance and with surety reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

  

### (d) _Required Withholding_.  Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder
or former holder of shares of Company Common Stock such amount as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any applicable Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the person entitled under this Agreement to
receive the payment in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

### (e) _Distribution of Exchange Fund to Parent; Escheat_. At any time
following the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall be
entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any portion of the
Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Shares immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including all interest and other income received
by the Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it) who have
not theretofore surrendered their Certificates evidencing such shares of
Company Common Stock for exchange pursuant to the provisions of this Section
2.10, and, thereafter, such holders shall be entitled to look to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof with respect to any

        

### Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent,
Purchaser, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall
be liable to any holder of a Share for any Merger Consideration delivered in
respect of such Share to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or other similar law.

  

### (f) _Closing of Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day
of the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed and thereafter there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Shares on the records of the Company. All cash paid upon the surrender of
the Certificates in accordance with this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares
formerly represented by such Certificates. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law.

  

## Section 2.11 _Taking of Necessary Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights,
privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Purchaser, the directors
and officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be deemed authorized to take
all such lawful and necessary action on behalf of the Company and Purchaser
for such purposes.

provision calling for any exclusive right to negotiate with such party or

approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any such Superior
Proposal or enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to any
such Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company Board shall

or capital stock of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by

### (e) A " _Superior Proposal_ " means an unsolicited bona fide Competing
Proposal ( _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, for such purposes, references in
the definition of Competing Proposal to "twenty percent (20%)" shall be
replaced by "fifty percent (50%)") providing for a transaction that the
Company Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) determines in its
good faith judgment (after consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation) is reasonably likely to be more favorable

that serve on the Company Board in such capacity) that was employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Acceptance Time

their respective Subsidiaries or affiliates, then such employee shall receive
the severance amount that would otherwise be payable to such employee upon
such termination under the existing severance and termination programs,
policies, agreements and plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries;

former directors or officers (the " _Indemnified Directors/Officers_ ") of
the Company and Subsidiaries as provided in their respective certificates of
incorporation or by-laws (or similar organizational documents) or agreements
providing for indemnification and exculpation, and all rights to advancement
of expenses, shall survive the Merger, shall not be amended to the detriment
of Indemnified Directors/Officers and shall continue in full force and effect
in accordance with their terms.

  

### (b) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, protect, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware Law the Indemnified
Directors/Officers against all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, fees and
expenses (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel and
judgments, fines, losses, claims, liabilities and amounts paid in settlement)
in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or investigation that
is, in whole or in part, based on or arising out of the fact that such person
is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and
arising out of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time.  In addition, upon receipt from an Indemnified Director/Officer of (i)
a written request for an advancement of fees or expenses incurred or to
be incurred in the defense of any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation for which such director or officer is reasonably expected to be
entitled to indemnification and (ii) a written undertaking by such director

expenses to such director or officer or pay such fees and expenses for such
director or officer, all in advance of the final disposition of any such
matter.

  

### (c) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain in effect directors and officers liability
insurance coverage covering the Indemnified Directors/Officers providing
coverage for acts or events occurring on or prior to the Effective Time, on
terms (including the amounts of coverage and the amounts of deductibles, if
any) that are no less favorable to the terms now applicable to them under the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies
(copies of which have been furnished to Parent or its Representatives);
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.06(c) more than an amount per
year equal to 300% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for
such insurance policies. If the provision and maintenance of coverage in
accordance with this Section 6.06(c) would exceed 300% of such current annual
premiums, (i) Parent shall notify the Indemnified Directors/Officers of the
amount of such excess and give such persons the opportunity to agree to
reimburse the Surviving Corporation for the amount of such excess and, if and
for so long as such reimbursement is made Parent and the
Surviving Corporation, shall continue to provide and maintain the coverage
contemplated by the first sentence of this Section 6.06(c); and (ii) if and
to the extent the Indemnified Directors/Officers do not agree to reimburse
the Surviving Corporation in accordance with the immediately preceding clause
(i), then the Surviving Corporation shall provide (at no cost to the
Indemnified Directors/Officers) the greatest amount of substantially
equivalent insurance reasonably obtainable for 300% of such current annual

        

### premiums. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Section 6.06(c), Parent may purchase a "tail" prepaid policy on the
directors and officers liability insurance for a period of six (6) years
from the Effective Time on terms (including the amounts of coverage and the
amounts of deductibles, if any) that are no less favorable to the terms now
applicable to them under the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance policies. In the event that Parent shall purchase such a
"tail" policy, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such
"tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor their
respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence of this Section
6.06(c) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be maintained in full force
and effect.

  

### (d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall honor the obligations of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, set forth in this Section 6.06.

  

### (e) The Indemnified Directors/Officers are each express third party
beneficiaries of this Section 6.06. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the obligations of the Surviving Corporation and Parent under this
Section 6.06 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to
adversely affect any person to whom this Section 6.06 applies without the
prior written consent of such affected person.

## Section 9.04 _Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law and any provision of
this Agreement expressly limiting the right to amend, supplement or
modify this Agreement (including Section 1.05(c)), this Agreement may be
amended, supplemented or modified by the parties hereto at any time by
execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent,
Purchaser and the Company before or after obtaining the approval from the
Company Stockholders in respect of the adoption of this Agreement with
respect to the Merger, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that after such approval no
amendment shall be made that by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange or quotation system requires further approval by such
stockholders or that would reduce the Merger Consideration without obtaining
such further approval. No amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall
be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by each party hereto
except as expressly provided herein.

  

## Section 9.05 _Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. At any time prior to
the Effective Time, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any obligation or other act of any other party
hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of
any other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto
and (c) waive compliance with any agreement of any other party or
any condition to its own obligations contained herein. No such extension or
waiver by any party hereto shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing
and signed by the party providing such extension or waiver.  No waiver by
any party of any term or condition, or default, misrepresentation or breach
thereof, of this Agreement, in any one or more instances, shall be deemed to
be or construed as a waiver of the same or any other term or condition, or
default, misrepresentation or breach thereof, of this Agreement on any future
occasion unless expressly provided therein. Any delay in exercising any right
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right. All
remedies, either under this Agreement or by law or otherwise afforded, will
be cumulative and not alternative. No conditions, course of dealing
or performance, understanding or agreement purporting to modify, vary,
explain or supplement the terms or conditions of this Agreement shall be
binding unless this Agreement is amended or modified in writing pursuant to
Section 9.04.

  

## Section 9.06 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
of law or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this
Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the
economic or legal

        

## substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party.  Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal, incapable of being enforced or
prohibited by public policy, the parties hereto shall replace such term or
other provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that
will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such provision.

  

## Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement,
the Confidentiality Agreement and the documents and instruments referred to
herein constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof. The Annexes and Exhibits to this Agreement are
incorporated herein by reference and made a part hereof. This Agreement shall
not be assigned (whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or
otherwise), except that Purchaser may assign all or any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to any other wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent without
the Companys consent if such assignment does not have any effect on the
Company Stockholders or on the transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its
obligations hereunder if such assignee does not perform such obligations.

  

## Section 9.08 _Parties in Interest; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto, and nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended
to or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement, other than Section
6.06 (which is intended to be for the benefit of the persons covered thereby
and may be enforced by such persons).

  

## Section 9.09 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof.  Accordingly, (a)
any party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent any breach
of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions
hereof, in addition to any other remedy at Law or in equity, and (b) each
party waives, in any action for specific performance, the defense of adequacy
of a remedy at Law.

  

## Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware without
giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law thereof.

  

## Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process_.  Each of
the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the exclusive
jurisdiction and venue of any state or federal court located within New
Castle County, State of Delaware in connection with any matter based upon or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, agrees
that all claims in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may and shall be heard
and determined in any such court, agrees that process may be served upon it
in any manner authorized by Delaware Law for such persons, including at
the address provided in Section 9.02, and waives, and covenants not to assert
or plead, any objection which it might otherwise have to such jurisdiction,
venue and

        

## process. Each party hereto hereby agrees not to commence any legal
proceedings relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Offer or the Merger) in any jurisdiction,
court or venue other than a state or federal court located within New Castle
County, State of Delaware.

  

## Section 9.12 _Waiver Of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, PURCHASER AND THE
COMPANY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE
TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

## Section 9.13 _Mutual Drafting_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement and hereby waive the application of any Law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
parties hereto and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party hereto by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

  

## Section 9.14 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. All capitalized terms
not defined in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall not be
entitled to claim that any fact or combination of facts constitutes a breach
of any of the representations, warranties or covenants contained in this
Agreement if and to the extent that such fact or combination of facts has
been disclosed in any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule in
sufficient detail to put a reasonable person on notice of the relevance
of the facts or circumstances so disclosed.  The inclusion of any item in
any section of the Company Disclosure Schedule (i) does not constitute an
admission by the Company, or to otherwise imply, that any such matter is
material, is required to be disclosed under this Agreement or falls within
relevant minimum thresholds or materiality standards set forth in this
Agreement and (ii) does not represent a determination by the Company that
such item did not arise in the ordinary course of business. In no event
shall the listing of any matter in the Company Disclosure Schedule be deemed
or interpreted to expand the scope of the Companys representations,
warranties and/or covenants set forth in this Agreement.  No disclosure in
the Company Disclosure Schedule of a possible breach or violation of any
contract or Law shall be construed as a representation or admission that such
breach or violation has occurred or exists. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Company Disclosure Schedule or this Agreement, the
information and disclosures contained in each section of the Company
Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and incorporated by
reference in each other section of the Company Disclosure Schedule to which
the applicability of such disclosure is reasonably apparent on the face of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, as though fully set forth in such other
section. All attachments to the Company Disclosure Schedule are incorporated
by reference into the Company Disclosure Schedule. The information contained
in the Company Disclosure Schedule is in all events provided to Parent
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement.

        

## Section 9.15 _Headings; Table of Contents_. The descriptive
headings and table of contents contained in this Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule) are included for convenience of reference only
and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement.

  

## Section 9.16 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered (including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts,
and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  

## Section 9.17 _Interpretation_. Unless otherwise indicated to the
contrary:

  

### (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section,
Annex, Exhibit, Schedule, clause or subclause, such reference shall be to an
Article, Section, Annex, Exhibit, Schedule, clause or subclause of this

pursuant to the HSR Act, the EC Merger Control Law or any other applicable
Law prior to the acceptance for Shares pursuant to the Offer shall not have
been obtained, or (c) at any time on or after the date of the Agreement and

restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting or preventing the

with such order, decree, injunction, ruling or other action would reasonably
be expected to be material to Parent or Purchaser;

  

#### (ii) any statute, rule, regulation, legislation or interpretation shall
have been enacted, promulgated, amended, issued or otherwise deemed
applicable by a Governmental Authority which is in effect and which (x)
prohibits the Offer or the Merger and the consequences of failure to comply
with such prohibition would reasonably be expected to be material to Parent
or Purchaser or (y) has a Company Material Adverse Effect or materially and
adversely diminishes the benefits expected to be derived by Parent from the
transactions contemplated by the Agreement;

  

#### (iii) any Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred since the

respects as of the date of the Agreement or shall not be true and correct as
of the consummation of the Offer with the same effect as if made at and as of
the expiration of the Offer (except to the extent such representations and
warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which cases such
representations and warranties shall not have been true and correct, as
described above, as of such earlier date), (B) the representations
and warranties of the Company contained in the Agreement (other than
Section 3.01(a), Section 3.02(a), Section 3.03(a), Section 3.04, Section 3.16
and Section 3.25(b)) including a "Company Material Adverse Effect"

date), or (C) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
the Agreement other than those representations and warranties contemplated by
clause (A) or (B) of this clause (iv) shall not have been true and correct as
of the date of the Agreement or shall not be true and correct as of the
expiration of the Offer without giving effect to any "material" qualification
or any similar qualification (except to the extent such representations and
warranties specifically relate to an earlier date, in which cases such
representations and warranties shall not have been true and correct, as
described above, as of such earlier date) and, in the case of clause (iv),
such failure to be true and correct has had, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

#### (v) the Company shall have failed to perform in all material respects
its obligations required to be performed by it under the Agreement at or
prior to the expiration of the Offer;

  

#### (vi) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its

respect of banks in the United States of America; or (C) any suspension by a
Governmental Authority on the extension of credit by banks or other financial
institutions in the United States of America;

  

#### (viii) all consents, registrations, approvals, permits, authorizations,
notices, reports or other filings required to be obtained or made by the
Company, Parent or Purchaser with or from any Governmental Authority or third
party in connection with the execution, delivery and performance of the
Agreement, the Offer and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
the Agreement shall not have been made or obtained and such failure would
have a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

  

#### (ix) Purchaser and the Company shall have agreed that Purchaser shall
terminate the Offer or postpone the acceptance for payment of Shares
thereunder.

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Purchaser and, subject
to Section 1.01(c) of the Agreement, may be waived by Purchaser in whole or
in part at any time and from time to time in its sole discretion. The failure
by Purchaser at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be
deemed a waiver of any such right; the waiver of any such right with respect
to particular facts and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with
respect to any other facts and circumstances; and each such right shall be
deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from time to
time unless waived.

  

The capitalized terms used in this _Annex A_ shall have the meanings
ascribed to them in the Agreement to which it is annexed.
