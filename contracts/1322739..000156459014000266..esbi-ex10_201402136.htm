Guarantors and the Buyers agree to act in good faith and use their
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the satisfaction of the conditions
specified in this Agreement necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties shall not be
obligated to litigate or contest any administrative proceeding or court action
that may be instigated by any Governmental Authority or other Person seeking
to enjoin or otherwise prevent consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement nor shall the parties or their Affiliates be required to
enter into any consent decree or other agreement to avoid the commencement of
such litigation.

Commitment Letter and Fee Letter in accordance with the terms and subject to
the conditions thereof, (ii) to negotiate and execute all definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt

provided, that in no event shall Buyers be required to pursue or threaten any
litigation against the Debt Financing Sources and (vi) to consummate the Debt
Financing at the Closing if such Debt Financing is available in accordance
with the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter and Fee Letter; provided,
however, that if funds in the amounts and on the terms set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter and Fee Letter become unavailable to the Buyers on the terms
and conditions set forth therein, the Buyers shall use their reasonable best
efforts to obtain as promptly as practicable, into account any "flex" provisions in the Fee Letter) to Buyer (the
"Alternative Financing") in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of
the Debt Financing that is still available and funds to be supplied by the
Buyers (or their Affiliates), to consummate the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement and to pay any other amounts required to be paid by the
Buyers and their Affiliates in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement, including all related fees and
expenses to be paid by the Buyers and their Affiliates and to provide the
Sellers with a copy of a new financing commitment that provides for such
Alternative Financing (the "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter"). If the
Buyers proceed with Alternative Financing, they shall be subject to the same
obligations as set forth in this Section 4.7(a) with respect to the Debt
Financing and the representations and warranties of the Buyers set forth in
Section 3.6 shall be true and correct in all material respects on and as of
the date of the obtaining of the Alternative Financing with the same effect as
though made on and as of such date. If applicable, except as otherwise
expressly stated, any reference in this Agreement to "Debt Financing" shall
include "Alternative Financing," any reference to "Debt Commitment Letter" or
"Fee Letter" shall include the "Alternative Financing Commitment Letter," and

"Financing Agreements" shall include any definitive agreements with respect to
such Alternative Financing.

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Buyers shall notify the Sellers as promptly as
reasonably practicable (and in any event within two Business Days) upon
obtaining knowledge (i) of any breach by any party to the Debt Commitment
Letter, the Fee Letter and/or the Financing Agreements, (ii) of any
termination of the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and/or the Financing
Agreements, (iii) of any material dispute or disagreement between or among any
parties to the Debt Commitment Letter or Fee Letter that could reasonably be
expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any ordinary
course negotiations with respect to the terms of the Debt Financing and/or the
Financing Agreements) and (iv) if at any time for any reason the Buyers
believe in good faith that they will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter. As soon as
reasonably practicable, the Buyers shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Sellers regarding the status of the Debt Financing relating
to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) of the
immediately preceding sentence. The Buyers shall not permit any amendment,
modification or supplement to be made to, or any waiver of, any provision or
remedy under the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and/or the Financing
Agreements, if applicable, that expands on the conditions precedent to the
funding on the Closing Date as set forth in such agreements or that could
otherwise reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case without the Sellers'
prior written consent (it being understood and agreed that, in any event, the
Buyers may amend the Debt Commitment Letter, Fee Letter and/or the Financing
Agreements to add lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents, managers or similar
entities that have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date of
this Agreement).

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors shall
provide, and shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause their respective
officers, employees, consultants, agents, advisors, affiliates and other
representatives, including legal and accounting, to provide, such cooperation
and assistance (including with respect to timeliness) in connection with the
arrangement of financings to be obtained by the Buyers in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Sellers or
the Sellers' Guarantors), as may be reasonably requested by the Buyers,
including, (i) providing to the Buyers from time to time reasonably requested
information (including financial and operating data and other information)
regarding the Purchased Assets, the Business and its industry that is
reasonably available to the Sellers and Sellers' Guarantors and using
reasonable best efforts to assist with identification of any portion of such
information that constitutes material non-public information and to supplement
or update such information to the extent the Sellers or the Sellers'
Guarantors become aware of any new material information (whether positive or
negative) related to the Purchased Assets or the Business that would cause the
representation and warranty made by the Buyers in Section 3 of the Debt
Commitment Letter to no longer be satisfied, (ii) participating in meetings,
presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions with prospective lenders and
sessions with rating agencies, (iii) assisting with the preparation of
customary materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents,

with any such financings (including, as required by applicable stock exchange
rules or securities laws), (iv) providing the Seller Required Information, (v)
assisting with the preparation of any pledge and security documents and
schedules, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or

customary in connection with the Debt Financing, (vi) taking all reasonable
actions necessary to, and permitting prospective financing sources to
(including providing reasonable access to Buyers and prospective financing
sources to all properties, books and records of the Business for such purposes

and other inspections), evaluate the Business and the Purchased Assets for the
purposes of establishing collateral arrangements, including obtaining and
providing appraisals and surveys, assisting with other collateral audits and
due diligence examinations and, (vii) arranging for customary lien
terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at Closing providing
for the discharge and termination on the Closing Date of all Liens necessary
to transfer the Purchased Assets free and clear of any Liens (other than
Permitted Liens); provided, in each case in clauses (i) through (vii), that
(A) nothing in this Section 4.7(c) shall require cooperation to the extent
that it would reasonably be expected to conflict with or violate the Sellers'
or the Sellers' Guarantors' organization documents or any law, (B) the
Sellers' and Sellers' Guarantors' board of directors and the directors,
managers and general partners of the Sellers' Subsidiaries shall not be
required to adopt resolutions approving the agreements, documents and
instruments pursuant to which the Debt Financing is obtained, shall be required to execute and deliver any Financing Agreements or other
agreements, pledge or security documents, or other certificates, legal
opinions or documents in connection with the Debt Financing and (D) the Buyers
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Sellers, the Sellers' Guarantors
and their respective pre-Closing directors, officers, employees and
representatives from and against any liability or obligation to providers of
the Debt Financing in connection with the Debt Financing and any information
provided in connection therewith (other than information furnished by or on
behalf of the Sellers and Sellers' Guarantors as specifically relates to
deliveries in respect of the Purchased Assets or Business). Except for the
representations and warranties concerning the Sellers, the Purchased Assets
and the Business set forth in Article 2 of this Agreement, the Sellers shall
not have any liability to the Buyers in respect of any financial information
or data or other information provided pursuant to this Section 4.7(c). If this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(a), 7.1(b), 7.1(c), 7.1(e) or
7.1(f) of this Agreement, the Buyers shall reimburse the Sellers and the
Sellers' Guarantors for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by the Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors in connection with this
Section 4.7(c). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
(I) none of the Sellers, the Sellers' Guarantors nor any of their Subsidiaries
shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee or incur any
other liability or obligation (other than the payment of reasonable out-of-
pocket costs, subject to reimbursement by the Buyers pursuant to the
immediately preceding sentence) in connection with the Debt Financing and (II)
without limiting the Sellers' and Sellers' Guarantors' cooperation obligations
under this Section 4.7(c) with respect to any Alternative Financing Commitment
Letter or Alternative Financing, if (x) the Buyers seek to obtain any
Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative Financing, (y) the
cooperation required to be provided pursuant to this Section 4.7(c) in
connection with such Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or Alternative
Financing is more onerous to the Sellers or the Sellers' Guarantors than what
is required to be provided pursuant to Section 4.7(b) with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letter in effect on the date hereof and without giving effect to
any Alternative Financing Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing contemplated
thereunder (to the extent more onerous, the "Incremental Debt Financing
Cooperation") and (z) the Sellers or Sellers' Guarantors fail to provide any
portion of such Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation, then such failure to
provide such Incremental Debt Financing Cooperation shall not be deemed to be
a breach of this Section 4.7(c) for purposes of Article 7 of this Agreement.
The Sellers hereby consent to the use of the logos, trademarks and service
marks of the Business in connection with any offering materials prepared with
respect to the financings described in this Section 4.7(c); provided that such
logos, trademarks and service marks are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to, and is not reasonably likely, to harm or disparage the Business
or the reputation or goodwill of the Business and its respective logos,
trademarks and service marks. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set
forth herein, the Sellers shall not be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee in connection with the financings contemplated by the Debt
Financing or additional public equity financing.

the Business (and the right to make copies), as may be necessary in connection
with any third party litigation (other than any indemnity claims by any Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article 6 of this Agreement), the preparation
of financial statements, or the conduct of any audit or investigation by a
Governmental Authority. In addition, the Sellers may retain a copy of all
lists, documents, records, written information, computer files and other
computer readable media to the extent any of the foregoing are included in the
Purchased Assets but also relate to the Excluded Businesses.

(b) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing, at the request of the
Buyers, the Sellers or the Sellers' Guarantors, as applicable, shall provide
the Buyers with access during normal business hours and upon reasonable

Business (and the right to make copies), as may be necessary in connection
with the preparation of any financial statements, including in connection with
any public or private equity offering.

agree to promptly remit to the Buyers any amounts in respect of accounts
receivable that are collected or received by the Sellers or their Affiliates
and constitute a Purchased Asset; (ii) the Buyers may receive and open all
mail and other communications addressed to the Sellers and received by the
Buyers at the properties subject to the Conveyed Leases; provided that if such
mail or communication does not primarily relate to the Business, the Buyers
will promptly forward the same to the Sellers; and (iii) if any asset
transferred to any of the Buyers is ultimately determined to be an Excluded
Asset or any Buyer or any of their Affiliates are ultimately found to be in
possession of any Excluded Asset, Buyers will promptly return or transfer and
convey (without further consideration) to Sellers, and Sellers will accept,
such asset, and the Buyers and Sellers will promptly execute such documents or
instruments of conveyance, and take such further acts which are reasonably
necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such asset back to the
Sellers. (a) As a material inducement to the Buyers to enter into this Agreement, the
Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors agree that, for a period commencing on the
Closing Date and terminating two (2) years after the Closing Date, such Person
will not, directly or indirectly (whether by itself, through an Affiliate,
partnership or otherwise) undertake, participate, be engaged or have any
financial or other interest in, or in any other manner advise or assist any
other Person in connection with the operation of, a Competing Business
anywhere in the world; provided, however, that (i) in the event that all or
substantially all of the equity of a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller
(including the Sellers' Guarantors), or all or substantially all of the assets
of a Seller or an Affiliate of a Seller (including the Sellers' Guarantors),
is sold or otherwise transferred to an unaffiliated third party, this
provision will have no further force or effect with respect (A) to such Seller
or such Affiliate (in the case of the sale of all or substantially all of the
equity of such Seller or such Affiliate) or (B) the acquiror of such Sellers'
or such Affiliate's assets (in the case of the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of such Seller or such Affiliate), and (ii) this provision
will have no further force or effect with respect to an acquisition by any
Seller or an Affiliate of any Seller (including the Sellers' Guarantors) of
any business (whether by an acquisition of assets, equity or otherwise) that
is involved in designing, developing, marketing, manufacturing, selling or
distributing baseball or softball equipment, products, gear, apparel or
related accessories (a "Permitted Business"), or the conduct of such Permitted
Business following such acquisition; provided, that the gross sales of such
Permitted Business during the twelve month period immediately preceding such
acquisition did not account for more than five percent (5%) of the aggregate
United States market share (on a wholesale or retail basis) of the baseball
and softball equipment manufacturing industry; provided, further that such
Permitted Business does not design, develop, market, manufacture, sell or
distribute any lacrosse equipment, products, gear, apparel or related
accessories. The Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors acknowledge that any
breach of this Section 4.10(a) will cause irreparable harm to the Buyers and
that the Buyers' remedy at law will be inadequate. For the avoidance of doubt,

Fenway Partners, LLC or its investment affiliates and portfolio companies
(other than Easton-Bell Sports, LLC and its Subsidiaries) or (ii) the Ontario

(other than Easton-Bell Sports, LLC and its Subsidiaries).

an Affiliate thereof) immediately following the Closing. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 4.10(b) shall not be deemed to apply to (i) general
solicitations of employment by use of advertisements in the media that are not
specifically directed at employees of the Parties or any of their Affiliates
from and after the Closing and the hiring as a result thereof, (ii) the
solicitation or hiring of any individual that has not been employed by the
Parties or any of their Affiliates any time during the six-month period
preceding the solicitation or hiring or (iii) the solicitation or hiring by
the Buyers' of any of the "Taiwan-based Product Creation Employees" (as

during the 12 month period before the Closing) to alter, reduce or terminate
its business relationship with the Buyers or any of their Affiliates. For the
avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.10(c) shall not be deemed to limit or
otherwise apply to Fenway Partners, LLC, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan or
any of their respective investment affiliates and portfolio companies.

not in substitution for any other remedy the Buyers may have.

Business (other than any asset that constitutes an Excluded Asset) to the
Sellers on or prior to the Closing Date. From and after the Closing, the
Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors shall, and shall cause each of their

and the Sellers and the Buyers shall jointly file all required change of
ownership and similar statements. At the Closing, the Sellers and the Buyers

4.15 Offer of Employment.

(a) The Sellers shall provide the Buyers, upon execution of this Agreement,
with reasonable access to the Business Employees and with information
requested by the Buyers with respect to compensation and benefits of the
Business Employees. The Buyers shall offer employment to all of the Business
Employees set forth on Schedule 2.16(a) (other than the individuals marked
with an asterisk), such Schedule 2.16(a) to be updated by Sellers on the
second Business Day prior to the Closing to reflect ordinary course hirings
and firings of Business Employees, from and after the date hereof (the
"Offered Employees"); provided, that an employee that is hired between the
date hereof and the Closing Date with a title of "manager" or higher shall not
be added to such schedule by Sellers without the consent of Buyer. All Offered
Employees who (A) accept the Buyers' offer of employment and (B) commence
employment with the Buyers or their Affiliates as of immediately following the
Closing shall be referred to herein as the "Acquired Employees". All offers of
employment to the Offered Employees shall provide for each Acquired Employee a
level of compensation and employee benefits substantially similar in the
aggregate to the level of compensation and employee benefits provided to each
such Acquired Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date, excluding
pension, retiree medical, equity-based compensation, retention bonuses, and
change-in-control benefits, except to the extent required to be provided
pursuant to applicable law. The employment of each such Acquired Employee with

Buyers. Subject to, and effective as of, the Closing, the Sellers hereby waive
and release each of the Acquired Employees from any and all contractual,
common law or other restrictions enforceable by the Sellers on the employment,
activities or other conduct of such individuals after their termination of
employment with Sellers except with respect to obligations related to
confidentiality, Intellectual Property and trade secrets.

Plan") immediately prior to the Closing Date and who had an account balance in
excess of $0.01 in such plan as of the Closing Date to be fully vested in such
account as at the Closing Date. Buyers shall permit the defined contribution
plan qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and maintained by the Buyers

pursuant to Section 401(a)(31)(D) of the Code, accept rollover contributions
of "eligible rollover distributions"(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31)
of the Code) of any Acquired Employee in cash in an amount equal to the full
account balance distributed to an Acquired Employee from the Sellers' Defined
Contribution Plan (including any outstanding loan balances). Prior to the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall amend the Sellers' Defined Contribution Plan
and such plan's loan policy to provide (if not so already provided) that any
plan loan of an Acquired Employee who elects a direct rollover of his or her
account and outstanding loan balances to the Buyer's Defined Contribution Plan
within sixty (60) days of the Closing Date shall not become due and payable in
full immediately as a result of his or her termination of employment with
Sellers and their Affiliates, provided that such loan be transferred to
Buyer's Defined Contribution Plan.

(e) Prior to the Closing Date, and to the extent necessary to implement this
sentence, Sellers shall amend any Benefit Plan and take or cause to be taken
all other action as may be required to provide that severance or separation
payments shall not be payable employment with the Sellers. Should any severance or separation obligations or
liabilities arise with respect to the termination of employment of any
Business Employees prior to or as of the Closing Date, then such obligations
and liabilities shall be borne solely by the Sellers.

Employee, in cash any and all bonuses for the 2013 calendar year which are
earned or accrued prior to the Closing.

Employees if the incident or alleged incident giving rise to the claim
occurred on or prior to the Closing Date.

report on a predecessor/successor basis as set forth therein, (ii) the Sellers
will not be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with respect to any Acquired

a Form W-2 for each such Acquired Employee with respect to the portion of the
year during which such Acquired Employees are employed by Buyers that includes
the Closing Date, excluding the portion of such year that such Acquired
Employee was employed by the Sellers.

(i) Schedule 4.15(i), to be updated by the Sellers two Business Days prior to
Closing, sets forth a list of all Business Employees who have been terminated
from employment within ninety (90) days prior to the Closing Date at each
Business location and the corresponding date of such terminations. The Buyers
will not, at any time within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, cause
(a) a "plant closing" (as defined in the WARN Act) or (b) a "mass layoff" (as
defined in the WARN Act) or any similar event under any comparable federal,
state or other law that would obligate (or have obligated) Sellers to provide
notice to any employees or cause Sellers to incur liability under the WARN Act
or any comparable federal, state or other law, in each case with respect to
the Acquired Employees.

(j) Nothing herein, express or implied, shall confer upon any current or
former employee of the Sellers or their Affiliates any rights or remedies
(including any right to employment or continued employment for any specified
period) of any nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this
Agreement. Nothing herein restricts the right of the Buyers to terminate the
employment of any Acquired Employee after the Closing Date. The Buyers and the
Sellers agree that the provisions contained herein are not intended to be for
the benefit of or otherwise be enforceable by, any third party, including any
current or former employee of the Sellers or their Affiliates.

Partners. From and after the date of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall, and shall cause each of their Affiliates to, use its respective
reasonable best efforts to (i) not interfere with or restrict the access to or

therewith, of the Business as of the date of this Agreement to the proprietary
and confidential information, Intellectual Property or Know How of the
Excluded Businesses as they relate to the hockey business or the supplier
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall not, and shall cause
each of Sellers' Affiliates not to, take, or cause to be taken, any action or

Intellectual Property or Know How of the hockey business of Buyers'

manner the Parties agree as follows:

(a) Buyers, and to the extent of their rights, their Affiliates, hereby grant
to Sellers, and each of them, and its successors and Affiliates a worldwide,
irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicenseable, non-exclusive, fully
paid up, royalty free, license to use the Seller Know How categorized under
the "Primarily Acquired Business" column listed in Schedule 4.18(a) in any
manner in the Excluded Businesses but, for certainty, not the lacrosse
business, provided that Sellers, and their Affiliates and successors will not
use, and are not licensed to use, such Seller Know How in the field of the
Business.

(b) Sellers, and to the extent of their rights, their Affiliates, hereby grant
to Buyers, and each of them, and its successors and Affiliates a worldwide,
irrevocable, perpetual, transferable, sublicenseable, non-exclusive, fully
paid up, royalty free, license to use the Retained Know How categorized under
the "Primarily Retained Business" column listed in Schedule 4.18(b) in any
manner in the Business, provided that Buyers and their Affiliates and
successors will not use, and are not licensed to use, such Retained Know How
in the field of the Excluded Businesses.

(c) Each Party, and its Affiliates and successors, will take all commercially
reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of such licensed Know How,
and will not disclose such licensed Know How to any third party except under
circumstances where such third party is obligated to maintain its
confidentiality and to restrict the use or other exploitation of the licensed
Know How to any third party except under circumstances where such third party
is obligated to maintain its confidentiality and to restrict the use or other
exploitation of the Know How expressly licensed herein in this Section 4.18.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party will be obligated to restrict
its use of in any manner, or to maintain the confidentiality of: (i) any
licensed Know How that becomes publicly accessible through no fault or breach
of a Party hereto or such Party's Affiliates, agents, contractors,
sublicensees or representatives, or (ii) any information, material, or
technology that is independently developed by a party or its agents,
contractors or representatives after the Closing Date without the use of or
reliance upon such licensed Know How, as shown by documentary evidence. In
addition, the confidentiality obligations set forth in this Section 4.18 will
not prevent any Party, or their Affiliates or successors from making any
disclosure required by applicable law provided that prior to such disclosure
the disclosing party makes reasonable efforts to obtain and/or take advantage
of protective orders, available redaction procedures, and other measures that
would allow disclosure without loss of confidentiality. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement, for a Party or its
employees, officers, contractors or agents to use or rely upon Residual
Knowledge. "Residual Knowledge" means information retained in unaided memory
without use of, or reliance upon the notes, or other external records or
documents (including the embodiments expressed for the Seller Know How), and
that was not intentionally memorized for the purpose of frustrating the
confidentiality restrictions set forth herein.

4.19 Representation and Warranty Policy. The Buyers shall not intentionally
take any actions, or fail to take any actions, to cause the Representation and
Warranty Policy to not become effective at Closing. The Sellers shall pay,
promptly following the date hereof, $43,500 to AIG Specialty Insurance Company
in respect of the "Deposit" payable under the Representation and Warranty
Policy (as defined therein).

4.20 280G. At least five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Sellers shall (i) use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from
each Offered Employee who is "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) a waiver by such individual of any and all Seller
payments (or other benefits) contingent on the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (within the meaning of Section
280G(b)(2)(A)(i) of the Code) to the extent necessary so that such payments
and benefits would not be "excess parachute payments" under Section 280G of
the Code and (ii) submit to its stockholders for a vote all such waived
payments in a manner such that, if such vote is adopted by the stockholders of
the Sellers in a manner that satisfies the stockholder approval requirements
under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and regulations promulgated
thereunder, no payment received from the Sellers by such Offered Employee who
is a "disqualified individual" would be a "parachute payment" under Section
280G(b) of the Code. The Sellers agree to provide to Buyer written drafts of
the shareholder disclosure statement, waivers, and stockholder approval forms
that will be provided to disqualified individuals and stockholders at least
three (3) Business Days in advance of delivering such documents to the
disqualified individuals and stockholders, as applicable, and allow Buyer and
its representatives an opportunity to provide comments on such documents which
comments the Sellers shall reasonably consider and include. CONDITIONS TO CLOSING

ARTICLE 6

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION

6.1 Survival. The Parties agree that the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until July 31,
2015, except that (i) the representations and warranties set forth in Sections
2.1 (Organization, Power and Standing), 2.2 (Power and Authority), 2.3
(Validity and Enforceability), 2.8 (Title to and Sufficiency of Purchased
Assets), and 2.19 (Brokers) (collectively, the "Seller Specified
Representations") will survive indefinitely; (ii) each covenant of the Sellers
or the Sellers' Guarantors requiring performance after the Closing shall
survive in accordance with its terms; and (iii) the indemnification
obligations of the Sellers or the Sellers' Guarantors pursuant to Section
6.2(c) will survive indefinitely, (the date the applicable survival period
terminates, the "Cut-Off Date"). No claim for indemnification hereunder may be
brought after the applicable Cut-Off Date, except for claims (a) of which the
Sellers have been notified in writing prior to the Cut-Off Date, or (b) of
which the Buyers have been notified in writing by the Sellers prior to the
Cut-Off Date.

6.2 Indemnification of the Buyers. Subject to the other terms of this Article
6, from and after the Closing, the Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors
(collectively, the "Seller Indemnifying Parties") shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify the Buyers and their directors, employees, officers,
equity holders, Affiliates, counsel and advisors (the "Buyer Indemnified
Parties") and hold them harmless against and in respect of any and all
damages, losses, Taxes, expenses, costs, obligations and liabilities,
including interest, penalties, out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable attorney's,
accountant's, consultant's and expert's fees (collectively, "Losses"), which
arise or result from or are based on (a) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties contained in Article 2, Section 8.18(c) or
contained in any certificate delivered at the Closing by the Sellers pursuant
to this Agreement (in each case determined without giving effect to any
"Material Adverse Effect", "materiality", or similar qualification, other than
with respect to Section 2.6(e) and except that the definition of Material
Contracts and the use of such defined term herein shall be read without
excluding such qualifications for purposes of this Section 6.2), (b) the
failure of the Sellers or the Sellers' Guarantors to perform any of their
covenants or agreements contained herein, or (c) the Excluded Liabilities. The
indemnification obligations of the Seller Indemnifying Parties under Section
6.2(a) of this Agreement, however, shall be subject to the following
limitations and conditions:

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, (i) the Seller
Indemnifying Parties shall not have any obligation to indemnify any Buyer
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 6.2(a) (x) for any individual Loss of
less than $150,000 (the "De Minimis Amount") and (y) unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such individual Losses incurred or sustained by all
Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to which the Buyer Indemnified Parties
would otherwise be entitled to indemnification under Section 6.2(a) exceeds
$1,500,000 (the "Threshold Amount"), whereupon the Seller Indemnifying Parties
shall be liable for all such Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount, but
subject to the following clause (ii), and (ii) the aggregate liability of the
Seller Indemnifying Parties to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties for
Losses under Section 6.2(a) shall in no event exceed the remaining Indemnity
Escrow amount after giving effect to any prior claims pursuant to Article 6
(the "Cap"); provided, however, that any and all breaches of the Seller
Specified Representations shall not be subject to the De Minimis Amount,
Threshold Amount or Cap, but instead shall be recoverable from "dollar one".
In no event shall the Seller Indemnifying Parties' aggregate liability for
claims under Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) exceed the Closing Purchase Price.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in Section 1.3
or Section 1.11 shall preclude the Buyers from making claims and recovering
losses in respect of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants of
the Sellers, the Sellers' Guarantors and their respective Subsidiaries;
provided, that no Party hereto shall be obligated to indemnify any other
Person with respect to any Losses with respect to any matter if such Losses
were included (and only to the extent so included) in the calculation of the
final adjustment to the Estimated Closing Purchase Price pursuant to Section
1.11.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (A) the Buyer
Indemnified Parties first source of recovery for any and all claims under
Article 6 shall be against the Indemnity Escrow, (B) the Indemnity Escrow
shall be the sole source of recovery with respect to any claims pursuant to
Section 6.2(a) (other than for breaches of the Seller Specified
Representations) and (C) for all other claims pursuant to Article 6, if and to
the extent the funds in the Indemnity Escrow are insufficient to cover the
Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
hereunder or if the Indemnity Escrow has terminated pursuant to its terms and
such claims may still be brought in accordance with this Agreement, then such
claims may be brought directly against subject to the other limitations set forth herein. In no event shall the
Indemnity Escrow limit the amount of Losses for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties may claim or receive indemnification under Section 6.2(a) for breaches
of the Seller Specified Representations, under Section 6.2(b) for breaches of
covenants and under 6.2(c) for Excluded Liabilities, but such Indemnity Escrow
shall limit any and all other claims for indemnification under this Article
6\.

6.3 Indemnification of the Seller. Subject to the other terms of this Article
6, from and after the Closing, the Buyers agree to indemnify the Sellers and
hold the Sellers harmless against and in respect of any and all Losses which
arise or result from any (a) breach of any of the Buyers' representations and
warranties or the representations and warranties of the Buyers' Guarantor, (b)
the failure of the Buyers to perform any of their covenants or agreements set
forth herein or (c) Assumed Liabilities, subject to Section 6.2(ii).

6.4 Procedure for Indemnification.

(a) Any Party making a claim for indemnification hereunder shall promptly
notify the indemnifying party of the claim in writing, describing the claim in
reasonable detail, the amount thereof, and the basis therefor; provided, that
the failure to provide prompt notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party
of its indemnification obligations hereunder, except to the extent that the
indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by the failure to give such prompt
notice. The Party from whom indemnification is sought shall respond to each
such claim within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice.

(b) If a claim for indemnification hereunder is based on a claim by a third
party (a "Third Party Claim"), the indemnifying party shall have the right to
assume the entire control of the defense thereof, at its own expense,
including employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified
party by providing written notice to the Party seeking indemnification that it
will assume the defense of such claim within fifteen (15) Business Days of
receipt of notice by the Party seeking indemnification, and, in connection
therewith, the Party claiming indemnification shall cooperate fully with the
indemnifying party and make available to the indemnifying party all pertinent
information under its control; provided, that the indemnified party may
participate in any proceeding with counsel of its choice at its expense
(except that the expense of such counsel shall be at the expense of the
indemnifying party if the indemnifying party and the indemnified party are
both named parties to the proceedings and the indemnified party reasonably
concludes that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the indemnifying party shall not be entitled to
assume control of such defense and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses
of counsel (reasonably acceptable to the indemnifying party) retained by the
indemnified party if (i) the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegations or
investigation; (ii) the claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against
the indemnified party; (iii) the indemnified party reasonably believes an
adverse determination with respect to the action, lawsuit, investigation,
proceeding or other claim giving rise to such claim for indemnification would
have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results
of operations, properties, assets or liabilities of the Business, (iv) the
indemnifying party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such
claim or (v) the Third Party Claim, individually or in the aggregate with any
other claim, is for Losses in excess of the amounts available for
indemnification pursuant to this Article 6 and the indemnified party
reasonably believes that its potential liability for such Losses is likely to
be in excess thereof. If the indemnifying party assumes the defense of the
Third Party Claim, such indemnifying party shall not consent to the entry of
any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to such Third Party
Claim without the prior written consent of the indemnified party unless (i)
the judgment or settlement provides solely for the payment of money by the
Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors and does not entail any admission of
liability on the part of the indemnified party, (ii) the indemnifying party
makes such payment in full and (iii) the indemnified party receives an
unconditional release, reasonably acceptable to the indemnified party, from
all Losses with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Parties shall act in
good faith in responding to, defending against, settling or otherwise dealing
with Third Party Claims, and cooperate in any such defense. Any settlement or
resolution of a Third Party Claim contemplated by the indemnified party if the
indemnifying party has not or is not entitled to assume the defense of such
claim, shall not be concluded without the prior written approval of the
indemnifying party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned.

6.5 Indemnification Generally.

(a) The amount which the indemnifying party is or may be required to pay to
any indemnified party pursuant to this Article 6 shall be reduced by (i) any
insurance proceeds (other than under the Representation and Warranty Policy)
actually received by such indemnified party related to the Losses, net of any
cost of recovery, including any increase in premiums and (ii) tax savings that
are actually realized by the indemnified Party in the year of the Loss as a
result of a Tax deduction by such indemnified Party in respect of such Loss

(b) An indemnified party is entitled to recover for (i) amounts in respect of
consequential, incidental, special and indirect damages, to the extent the
facts and circumstances giving rise to or underlying such Loss are reasonably
foreseeable and (ii) any and all damages (including punitive damages), to the
extent awarded to a third party in connection with a Third Party Claim.

(c) Upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or
does, give rise to an indemnification claim, the Buyers will, and will cause
the Buyer Indemnified Parties, to take commercially reasonable steps to
mitigate any Losses be required to seek recovery against the Representation and Warranty Policy
prior to bringing an indemnification claim against the Seller Indemnifying
Parties under this Agreement.

6.6 Exclusive Remedy. From and after the Closing, except (i) as provided in
Section 1.11, with respect to the determination of Closing Working Capital,
(ii) with respect to the specific enforcement of any covenant requiring
performance after the Closing and (iii) with respect to fraud, this Article 6
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to the Parties in respect of
breaches or violations of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement.

6.7 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. It is the intention of the Parties to
treat any indemnity payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the
purchase price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the
Parties shall file their Tax Returns consistent with such intent, except as
otherwise required by a change in applicable law or a final determination.

ARTICLE 7

7.1 Termination. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, this Agreement may be terminated prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Sellers and the Buyers;

Authority has issued a final and non-appealable order, decree or ruling
permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation
of the sale and purchase of the Purchased Assets contemplated by this
Agreement;

(c) by either the Sellers or the Buyers, if the Closing has not occurred by

provided, further, that (i) such Termination Date may be automatically
extended at the election of the Buyers until such time as is necessary to
obtain all of the consents set forth on Schedules 5.1(d) and (ii) if the

shall have expired or been terminated and (y) the sixtieth (60th) day
following the original Termination Date;

be satisfied), upon written notice to the Sellers, if there has been a
material violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement of the Sellers contained in this Agreement, which
violation, breach or inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Sections 5.1(a) or (b) not to be satisfied, and such violation, breach or
inaccuracy has not been waived by the Buyers or cured by the Sellers, as
applicable, by the earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by

be satisfied), upon written notice to the Buyers, if there has been a material
violation, breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement of the Buyers contained in this Agreement, which violation, breach
or inaccuracy would cause any of the conditions set forth in Sections 5.2(a)
or (b) not to be satisfied, and such violation, breach or inaccuracy has not
been waived by the Sellers or cured by the Buyers, as applicable, by the
earlier of (x) twenty (20) Business Days after receipt by the Buyers of
written notice thereof from the Sellers and (y) the Termination Date (as the
same may be extended pursuant to Section 7.1(c); or

(f) By the Sellers, upon written notice to the Buyers, if all of the
conditions set forth in Section 5.1 shall have been previously satisfied
(other than conditions that, by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing and which were, as of such date, capable of being satisfied) and the
Buyers have failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement by the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to Section
1.7. (a) If this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 7.1 above, this
Agreement shall become null and void and have no further force or effect and
the Parties shall have no further obligations hereunder (including for costs
and expenses incurred by other parties in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby), except that each Party shall be liable
for its intentional breach of the provisions of this Agreement and the non-
breaching Party hereto shall be entitled to all rights and remedies provided
by law or equity in respect of such breach, but in the case of the Buyers,
subject to the limitations contained in Sections 7.3(b), 7.3(c), 7.3(d) and
8.6(b).

(b) The obligations of the Sellers and the Sellers' Guarantors under Section
4.1(b) and the provisions contained in this Section 7.2 and Article 8 shall
survive the termination of this Agreement.

(a) If (i) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Sellers pursuant to
Section 7.1(f) or (ii) this Agreement is validly terminated by the Buyers
pursuant to Section 7.1(c) and, solely in the case of clause (ii), at the time
of such termination all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.1 shall have
been previously satisfied (other than conditions that, by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing and which were, as of such date, capable of being
satisfied), Sellers have confirmed that they are prepared to consummate the
transaction and the Buyers have failed to consummate the transaction (clauses
(i) and (ii) each, a "Financing Failure Termination Event"), then the Buyers
shall pay to the Sellers a fee equal to $13,000,000 (the "Financing Failure
Termination Fee") within three (3) Business Days after such termination.

(b) The Buyers acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
that, without these agreements, the Sellers would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Buyers fail to pay any amounts due pursuant to
this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Sellers commence
an Action that results in a judgment against the Buyers for the payment of the
Financing Failure Termination Fee the Buyers shall pay to the Sellers their
reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
expenses) in connection with such Action.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that any amount payable pursuant to
Section 7.3(a) does not constitute a penalty but shall constitute liquidated
damages to compensate the Sellers. If a Financing Failure Termination Event
occurs, the payment of the Financing Failure Termination Fee (together with
any expenses payable pursuant to Section 7.3(c)) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Sellers, any of their Affiliates or their respective
former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons, partners,
directors, officers, employees, service providers, financing sources,
including, without limitation, with respect to the Debt Financing, advisors or
representatives (collectively, the "Seller Parties") against the Buyers or any
of their Affiliates or their respective former, current or future
equityholders, controlling persons, partners, directors, officers, employees,
service providers, Debt Financing Sources, advisors or representatives
(collectively, the "Buyer Parties") with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation in connection with this
Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby and upon the Seller Parties' receipt of such amounts, none of the
Buyer Parties shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. The Parties acknowledge and agree that in no
event shall the Buyers pay the Financing Failure Termination Fee on more than
one occasion.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Parties
further acknowledge and agree that, upon a Financing Failure Termination
Event, none of the Buyer Parties shall have any liability under, or with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein (other than
the Buyers for the payment of the Financing Failure Termination Fee, as
provided herein), and the Sellers agree that they shall not, and shall not
allow any Seller Party to, bring any cause of action against or otherwise seek
remedies from any Buyer Party, whether at equity or in law, for breach of
contract, in tort or otherwise, and any such claim is hereby fully waived,
released and forever discharged (other than actions against the Buyers for the
failure to pay the Financing Failure Termination Fee, as provided herein, or
under Section 8.6 for specific performance in accordance with Section 8.6);
provided, that in the event of a Financing Failure Termination Event the
aggregate liability of the Buyer Parties under, or related to, this Agreement
prior to the Closing (whether or not this Agreement is terminated, and
regardless of the reason for any such termination) shall not exceed the
Financing Failure Termination Fee, together with any expenses payable pursuant
to Section 7.3(c)

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated herein and that, without
these agreements, the Parties would not enter into this Agreement. MISCELLANEOUS
