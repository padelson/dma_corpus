Accounting Principles and without giving effect to the Transactions (other

(b) After receipt of the Closing Statement from Buyer, Seller shall have
forty-five (45) days to review the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_
") and notify Buyer in writing prior to the expiration of the Review Period of
any dispute or objection thereto, setting forth in reasonable detail the
particular items of any such dispute or objection (such written notice, the "
_Objection_ "). If Seller has not notified Buyer of an Objection within the

accepted by the parties and shall become final, binding and conclusive.
Seller and Buyer shall, within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as
Seller and Buyer may agree in writing) following delivery of an Objection to
Buyer (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith to resolve their
differences, all such discussions and communications related thereto shall

its or their representatives in connection with their respective review of the
Closing Statement and the Objection, as the case may be, including providing
on a timely basis all other information and copies of records or other
documents of the Business necessary or useful in connection with the review of
the Closing Statement and the Objection as is reasonably requested by such
other party or its or their representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the accountants of Buyer shall not be obliged to make any work papers
available to Seller or its representatives except in accordance with such
accountants normal disclosure procedures and then only after such Person has
signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form
and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants.

(d) If at the end of the Resolution Period Seller and Buyer have been unable
to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters
specified in the Objection, Seller and Buyer shall refer all matters that
remain in dispute with respect to the Objection (the " _Unresolved Matters_
") to Deloitte and Touche LLP (or if such firm is unable or unwilling to accept
such engagement, an internationally recognized independent public accounting
firm that has not provided material services to either Seller or Buyer or
their respective Affiliates in the preceding three (3) years as jointly
selected by Seller and Buyer or, if Seller and Buyer are unable to agree
within five (5) Business Days from the end of the Resolution Period, then
such internationally recognized independent public accounting firm jointly
selected by Sellers and Buyers independent accountants within five (5)
Business Days thereafter) (such firm, as finally selected, the " _Accounting
Firm_ "). Seller and Buyer each agree to promptly sign an engagement letter,
in commercially reasonable form, as may reasonably be required by the
Accounting Firm. Each of Buyer and Seller shall submit to the Accounting Firm
(with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day), within ten (10)
Business Days after the date of the engagement of the Accounting Firm, a
memorandum (which may include supporting exhibits) setting forth
their respective positions with respect to the Unresolved Matters. Each of
Buyer and Seller may (but shall not be required to) submit to the Accounting
Firm (with a copy delivered to the other party on the same day), within ten
(10) Business Days after the date of the engagement of the Accounting Firm, a
memorandum responding to the initial memorandum submitted to the Accounting
Firm by the other party. Unless requested by the Accounting Firm in writing,
no party hereto may present any additional information or arguments to the
Accounting Firm, either orally or in writing. None of Seller, Buyer or any of
their respective Affiliates or representatives shall have any ex parte
communications or meetings with the Accounting Firm regarding the subject
matter hereof without the other partys prior written consent. The Accounting
Firm shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of the Business
to calculate the Closing Statement. The Accounting Firm shall act as an
expert and not as an arbitrator to calculate, based solely on the written
submissions of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, and only
with respect to the Unresolved Matters submitted and without independent
investigation, whether and to what extent the Closing Statement requires
adjustments

 



20  and shall be instructed that its calculation (A) must be made in strict
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Agreed Accounting
Principles, without regard to principles of equity, and (B) with respect to
each Unresolved Matter, must be within the range of values established for
such amount as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by
Seller in the Objection and by Buyer in the Closing Statement. Seller and
Buyer shall request the Accounting Firm to (i) submit its final written
determination to Seller and Buyer as soon as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) Business Days after the Accounting Firms engagement, and
(ii) prepare the Final Closing Statement (which shall be consistent with the
Resolved Matters and the final determination of the Accounting Firm of the
Unresolved Matters) and calculate the Final Purchase Price based on
such Final Closing Statement. The Accounting Firms final written
determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Seller and Buyer. The "
_Final Closing Statement_ " shall be (i) in the event that no Objection is
delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration of the Review Period,
the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section
2.5(a)_, (ii) in the event that an Objection is delivered by Seller to Buyer
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered
by Buyer to Seller pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ as adjusted pursuant to the
agreement of Seller and Buyer in writing or (iii) in the event that an
Objection is delivered by Seller to Buyer prior to the expiration of the
Review Period and Seller and Buyer are unable to agree on all matters set
forth in such Objection, the Closing Statement delivered by Buyer to Seller
pursuant to _Section 2.5(a)_ as adjusted by the Accounting Firm to be
consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final determination of the
Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters in accordance with this _Section
2.5(d)_. In the event the Final Closing Statement is determined (x) pursuant
to clause (i) or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, Buyer shall
prepare the Final Closing Statement and calculate the Final Purchase Price, in
each case, in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver
such items to Seller within three (3) Business Days following the
determination thereof or (y) pursuant to clause (iii) of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Accounting Firm shall prepare the Final Closing
Statement (which shall be consistent with the Resolved Matters and the final
determination of the Accounting Firm of the Unresolved Matters) and calculate
the Final Purchase Price based on the Final Closing Statement, in each case,
in strict accordance with the terms of this Agreement, and deliver such items
to Seller and Buyer within three (3) Business Days following the delivery of
the final written determination of the Accounting Firm to Seller and Buyer.
The date on which the Final Closing Statement is finally determined and
delivered in accordance with this _Section 2.5(d)_ is hereinafter referred to
as the " _Eligibility Date_ ".

 

(e) Buyer and Seller agree that the procedures set forth in this _Section
2.5_ for resolving disputes with respect to the calculation of Closing
Statement shall be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any such
disputes; _provided_ that this provision shall not prohibit any party from
instituting litigation to enforce any decision pursuant to the terms hereof
by the Accounting Firm in any court of competent jurisdiction. The substance
of the Accounting Firms determination shall not be subject to review or
appeal, absent a showing of fraud. It is the intent of the parties to have
any determination of Unresolved Matters by the Accounting Firm proceed in an
expeditious

 



21  manner; _provided_ , _however_ , any deadline or time period contained
herein may be extended or modified by agreement of the parties, and the
parties agree that the failure of the Accounting Firm to strictly conform to
any deadline or time period contained herein shall not be a basis for seeking
to overturn any determination rendered by the Accounting Firm. Any fees and
expenses relating to the engagement of the Accounting Firm in respect of its
services pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be shared by Seller and Buyer
so that Sellers share of such fees and expenses shall be in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount that is unsuccessfully disputed by
Seller bears to the total amount initially disputed by Seller.

(f) The " _Final Purchase Price_ " shall mean the Enterprise Value, _plus_ :

(i) the Closing Date Cash as set forth in the Final Closing Statement; 
_minus_

(ii) the Closing Date Indebtedness as set forth in the Final Closing
Statement; _plus_

 

(iii) the amount by which, if any, the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as
set forth in the Final Closing Statement) is greater than the Maximum Target
Net Working Capital; _minus_

(iv) the amount by which, if any, the Closing Date Net Working Capital (as
set forth in the Final Closing Statement) is less than the Minimum Target Net
Working Capital.

If the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Initial Purchase Price, then
Buyer shall pay Seller (to one or more accounts designated by Seller) within
two (2) Business Days of the Eligibility Date, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in U.S. dollars, free and clear of any withholdings or other
deductions, an amount in cash equal to the absolute value of such difference
between the Final Purchase Price and the Initial Purchase Price. If the Final
Purchase Price is less than the Initial Purchase Price, then Seller shall pay
Buyer (to such account designated by Buyer) within two (2) Business Days of
the Eligibility Date, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
dollars, free and clear of any withholdings or other deductions, an amount in
cash equal to the absolute value of such difference between the Final Purchase
Price and the Initial Purchase Price.

 

SECTION 2.6 _Withholding Rights_. Buyer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from amounts otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this
_Article II_ such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payments under any tax Laws. Any amounts so deducted and
withheld shall be promptly paid over to the relevant Taxing Authority and
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to making any such deduction or
withholding, Buyer shall provide Seller with reasonable advance notice (and
not, in any event, less than ten (10) Business Days notice), to permit Seller
an opportunity to provide Buyer or the Sold Companies with certificates or
other appropriate documentation to reduce or eliminate the need for such
deduction or withholding.

is duly qualified or licensed to do business and in good standing in the

Company, in each case as amended and in effect on the date hereof, including

Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by Seller, and Seller shall
duly execute and deliver each Closing Agreement to which it is a party and,

of the Business together with all notes and schedules thereto for the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 and the

operated as separate "stand-alone" entity within Seller. As a result, the
Business has been allocated certain charges and credits for purposes of the
preparation of the Financial Statements. Such allocations of charges and
credits do not necessarily reflect the amounts that would have resulted from
arms-length transactions or the actual costs that would be incurred if the
Business operated as a "stand-alone" entity. The allocations of charges and
credits contained in the Financial Statements were made on a consistent basis
in each period and are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of the
services received from Seller by, or benefits provided by Seller to, the
Business for the periods indicated therein.

equity interest, asset or property of any Sold Company is subject, (iii)
violate or result in a breach of any Order or Law applicable to Seller or the
Sold Companies or any of their respective properties, or (iv) except for

(xvii) enter into any agreement (A) or agree or commit to take any of the
actions described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (xx), (B) which would

or any of the Closing Agreements untrue or incorrect in any material respect
or could result in any of the conditions to the Closing not being satisfied;
or (C) that would have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Other than the right to consent or withhold consent with respect to the
matters set forth in _Section 5.1(b)_ and the restrictions and prohibitions
with respect to the conduct of the Business by Seller as a result thereof
(including the rights and remedies of Buyer hereunder), nothing contained
herein shall give Buyer any right to manage, control, direct or be involved in
the management of Seller, the Sold Companies or the Business prior to the
Closing.

 

SECTION 5.2 _Access_. During the Pre-Closing Period, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Sold Companies to, (i) reasonably cooperate with Buyer to
facilitate the transition to Buyer on the Closing Date of the IT systems and
network used in the operation of the Business or by the Sold Companies
(provided that such cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
Business or the business of Seller), and (ii) afford to Buyer, through its
employees and authorized representatives, reasonable access during normal
business hours and upon prior reasonable written notice to Seller, to the
officers, properties, facilities, assets, Contracts, books, financial
information and records of the Sold Companies (including (x) working papers
and data in the possession of Seller or the Sold Companies or its accountants
and (y) IT staff in order to assess the transition of IT services to Buyer);
_provided_ that such access does not interfere unreasonably with the normal
business operations of Seller or the Sold Companies; and

 



51   _provided_ , _further_ , that such access shall not include any invasive or
destructive sampling or testing of any environmental medium or building
material; _provided_ ,  _further_ , Buyer shall not have access to personnel
records of Seller or its Affiliates relating to individual performance or
evaluation records, medical histories or other information which in Sellers
good faith opinion is sensitive or the disclosure of which could subject
Seller or any of its Affiliates to risk of liability. If the foregoing access
involves entry onto any properties of the Sold Companies, Seller shall be
entitled to have a representative of Seller accompany Buyer or its authorized
representatives at all times. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Seller and the Sold Companies shall not be required to disclose (A)
any information to Buyer if Seller is advised in writing by counsel that such
disclosure would be reasonably likely to (w) include competitively sensitive
information (in which case such information shall be disclosed in compliance
with the Joint Defense Agreement), (x) jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege, or (y) violate any applicable Law or Order, (B) information
relating to any sale or divestiture process conducted by Seller or its
Affiliates for the Business or Sellers or its Affiliates (or their
Representatives) evaluation of the Business in connection therewith,
including projections, financial or other information relating thereto, or (C)
any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar Tax Return of which Seller or
any of its Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) is the common parent or
any other information relating to Taxes or Tax returns other than information
relating solely to the Sold Companies; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
design and implement alternative disclosure arrangements and, to the extent
available, use such alternative disclosure arrangements to provide
information, documents, and access to the Buyer and its representatives,
agents, employees, counsel, and advisors in a manner that would not violate
applicable Law or Order or cause the loss of attorney-client privilege with
respect thereto. The parties agree that the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect following
the execution and delivery of this Agreement until the Closing, and all
information obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.2_ shall be kept
confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

SECTION 5.3 _Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to Buyers obligations set forth in _Section 5.3(d)_, each of
Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use its
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (i)
to consummate and make effective the Transactions (including the preparation
and filing of all forms, registrations and notices and the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the
Transactions), and (ii) to obtain any Consent of any third Person,
including any Governmental Antitrust Authority, required to be obtained or
made by Seller or Buyer, or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates
in connection with the Transactions or the taking of any action contemplated
by this Agreement.

 

(b) Each of Seller and Buyer shall (i) as soon as reasonably practicable (and
in any event within seven (7) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement) file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_
") and the United States Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") the
notification and report form required for the Transactions, if any, and to
supply as promptly as practicable any supplemental

 



52  information requested in connection therewith pursuant to the HSR Act and
(ii) as soon as reasonably practicable make all filings under the applicable
Other Competition Laws required for the Transactions, if any, and shall take
all other actions necessary, proper or advisable to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act and the
applicable Other Competition Laws. Any such antitrust notification and report
form or filing and supplemental information shall be in substantial compliance
with the requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Other Competition Laws,
as the case may be. Each of Buyer and Seller shall furnish to the other party
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may
request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is
necessary under the HSR Act or the applicable Other Competition Laws, as the
case may be. Seller and Buyer shall use their respective reasonable best
efforts to comply promptly with any inquiries or requests for additional
information from the FTC, the DOJ, and any other Governmental Antitrust
Authorities having jurisdiction. 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings set forth in _Sections
5.3(a)_ , _(b)_ and  _(d)_ and subject to any appropriate confidentiality
protections, Seller, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall each
furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
the other may reasonably request in connection with this _Section 5.3_ and
shall each promptly provide counsel for the other party (which may be done on
an outside counsel only basis) with copies of all filings made by such party,
and all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) and any
Governmental Antitrust Authority, and any other information supplied by such
party or such partys Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust Authority in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions;  _provided_ , _however_
, that materials provided pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ may be redacted
(i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business, (ii) as
necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as necessary to
address reasonable legal privilege concerns. Subject to applicable Law, Seller
and Buyer shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to
review in advance, and shall consider in good faith the views of the other
party in connection with, any proposed written or, if practicable, oral
communication to any Governmental Antitrust Authority relating to the
Transactions. Each of Seller and Buyer agrees not to participate in
any substantive meeting or discussion, either in person or by telephone, with
any Governmental Antitrust Authority in connection with the Transactions
unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not
prohibited by such Governmental Antitrust Authority, gives the other party
the opportunity to attend and participate.

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall take, or cause to be taken, any and all actions, including
the disposition of assets, required by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as
a condition to the granting of any Consent necessary for the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby that would otherwise reasonably be
expected to materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, such actions include, but are not limited to: (i) divesting,
selling or otherwise disposing of, or holding separate and

 



53  agreeing to sell or otherwise dispose of, any entities, assets or facilities
of the Sold Companies or any entity, facility or asset of Buyer or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, (ii) terminating, amending or assigning any
existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations, and (iii)
amending, assigning or terminating any existing licenses or other agreements
and entering into such new licenses or other agreements (and, in each case,
entering into agreements with the relevant Governmental Antitrust Authority
giving effect thereto) in each case with respect to the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii) or (iii) if such action is necessary or reasonably advisable or as may
be required by any Governmental Antitrust Authority as a condition to the
granting of any Consent necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or as may be required to avoid, lift, vacate, reverse or
resolve any legislative, administrative or judicial action (including any suit
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or any other
applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging any of
the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of the U.S. Antitrust Laws
or Other Competition Laws) that would otherwise reasonably be expected to
materially impair or delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement; provided that any such action shall not be required to be
effective prior to the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this _Section 5.3(d)_, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require
Buyer, or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, to take, or agree to take,
any action or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with
obtaining any Consent necessary from any Governmental Antitrust Authority,
that: (a) would require Buyer or any of its Affiliates to threaten or file
any suit or engage in any litigation with any Person; (b) would require Buyer
to divest, otherwise dispose of or hold separate assets with a fair market
value in excess of $15,000,000; (c) would require Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to breach any contractual obligations the
reasonably likely result of which would be to cause Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates to incur losses in excess of $15,000,000; or (d)
would reasonably be likely to have a material and adverse effect on Buyer and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Closing
hereunder (with materiality measured on a scale relative to the Sold
Companies, taken as a whole).

 

(e) The filing fees under the HSR Act and Other Competition Laws, as well as
the fees and disbursements of any legal counsel or other advisor jointly
retained by the parties in connection with any such filings, shall be paid
fifty percent (50%) by each of Buyer and Seller.

 

(f) Without limiting any other obligation under this Agreement, during the
period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and controlled Affiliates to not, take
or agree to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent or
delay the parties from obtaining any Consent of any Governmental Antitrust
Authority in connection with the Transactions, or to prevent or materially
delay or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated herein,
including any acquisition (whether via merger, consolidation, stock or asset
purchase or otherwise) of or agreement to acquire any material amounts of
assets of or equity in any other Person or any business or division thereof if
such acquisition or agreement would be reasonably expected to create a 

 



54  material risk of making it more difficult to obtain the Consent of the FTC
or the DOJ or any other Governmental Antitrust Authority required in
connection with the Transactions.

 

SECTION 5.4 _Third Party Consents_. Each of Buyer and Seller shall use its
respective commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent of any
Person (other than Governmental Antitrust Authorities) required to consummate
and make effective the Transactions, including obtaining each of the Consents
set forth on _Schedule 5.4_. Each party agrees to cooperate reasonably with
the other party in obtaining such Consents. To the extent that Seller and
Buyer are unable to obtain any required third party Consents prior to the
Closing (such Consents, the " _Post-Closing Consents_ "), Seller
shall cooperate with Buyer to make or obtain (or cause to be made or
obtained), as promptly as practicable following the Closing, all Post-Closing
Consents.

 

SECTION 5.5 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to each other,
upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance
relating directly to the Sold Companies (including access to books and
records, employees, contractors and representatives) as is reasonably
necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns, the making of any election
related to Taxes, the preparation for and response to any audit by any Taxing
Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding
relating to any Tax Return; _provided,_ _however_ , that if such requested
information is contained within a document containing any unrelated
information, only portions pertaining to such relevant information shall be
furnished. Buyer and Seller shall retain all books and records with respect to
Taxes pertaining to the Sold Companies until the expiration of all relevant
statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer and Seller, as
the case may be, any extensions thereof). At the end of such period, each
party shall provide the other with at least thirty (30) days prior written
notice before destroying any such books and records, during which period the
party receiving such notice can elect to take possession, at its own expense,
of such books and records. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement,
including this _Section 5.5(a)_, Seller and the Sold Companies shall not be
required to disclose any consolidated, combined, unitary or similar income Tax
Return of which Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the
Sold Companies) is the common parent or any other information relating to
Taxes or Tax Returns other than information relating solely to the Sold
Companies.

 

(b) _Tax Returns_. Seller shall prepare and timely file (or cause to be
prepared and timely filed) its U.S. federal and any other affiliated,
consolidated, combined, or unitary income Tax Returns in respect of Seller and
any of the Sold Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and with respect to
any Straddle Period; _provided_ that, in the case of any such Tax Return for
any Straddle Period which would include the Sold Companies for the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date, (i) Seller shall prepare
and timely file (or cause to be prepared and timely filed) any such
Tax Returns in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as

 



55  required by applicable Law and (ii) Seller shall provide Buyer with a draft
of any such Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days before the filing due date
and Seller shall make (or cause to be made) any changes to such Tax Returns
reasonably requested by Buyer. Buyer shall prepare and timely file (or cause
the Sold Companies to prepare and timely file) any other Tax Returns of the
Sold Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period and with respect to any
Straddle Period; _provided_ that (i) Buyer shall prepare and timely file any
such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with prior practice, except as
required by applicable Law and (ii) Buyer shall provide Seller with a draft
of any such Tax Returns at least thirty (30) days before the filing due date
and Buyer shall make any changes to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by
Seller.

 

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. Seller shall cause the provisions of any
agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes (including any Tax
sharing agreements) between Seller, on the one hand, and any Sold Company, on
the other hand, to be terminated on or before the Closing Date. After the
Closing Date no person shall have any rights or obligations under any such
agreement, arrangement or practice with respect to Taxes.

(d) Buyer shall not make, or cause to be made, any election under Section 338
or 336(e) of the Code (or any similar provision under state, local or foreign
law), relating to any of the Sold Companies.

 

SECTION 5.6 _Tax Indemnity_.

 

(a) Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement and to the extent
not taken into account in the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital,
from and after the Closing, Seller agrees to indemnify Buyer and its officers,
directors, employees, agents representatives and Affiliates (including, after
the Closing, the Sold Companies) and hold each of them harmless against (i)
any Taxes imposed on or with respect to the Sold Companies for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period and, with respect to any taxable period that begins on or before
and ends after the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), for the portion
thereof ending on and including the Closing Date, (ii) any and all Taxes of
any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, or unitary group of which
any of the Sold Companies (or any predecessor of any of the foregoing) is
or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, pursuant to Treasury
Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state, local, or non-U.S. law
or regulation, (iii) any Incremental Deferred Tax Liability that results in a
positive amount, (iv) without duplication for any amounts recoverable for a
positive Incremental Deferred Tax Liability under clause (iii) of this
_Section 5.6(a)_, any Losses resulting from each breach of the
representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.11(i)_ of this
Agreement, and (v) covenants set forth in _Section 5.5_ of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Tax indemnity provided
under this  _Section 5.6(a)_ shall not cover Tax liabilities (I) resulting
from any transaction of the Sold Companies outside the Ordinary Course of
Business that occurs after the Closing or (II) resulting from any action taken
after the Closing by Buyer, any of its Affiliates, or any transferee of Buyer
or its Affiliates.

 



56 (b) Subject to the provisions set forth in this Agreement, from and after
the Closing, Buyer agrees to indemnify Seller and its respective officers,
directors, employees, agents, representatives and Affiliates and hold each of
them harmless against all Tax liabilities of the Sold Companies other than
those which are Sellers responsibility pursuant to the immediately preceding
paragraph and any failure of Buyer to perform any covenants or other
agreements of Buyer contained in _Section 5.5_, _Section 5.6_, _Section
5.7_ or  _Section 5.8_ hereof; _provided_ _further_ , that Buyer agrees to
indemnify Seller and its officers, directors, employees, agents
representatives and Affiliates and hold each of them harmless against any
Incremental Deferred Tax Liability that results in a negative amount.

(c) The parties agree that the amount of any indemnification payment
made pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall be determined in accordance with
_Section 9.8(c)_.

(d) Payment by the Indemnifying Party of any amount due under this _Section
5.6_ shall be made within ten (10) Business Days following written notice by
the Indemnified Party that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing
Authority is due;  _provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall not be
required to make any payment earlier than five (5) Business Days before it is
due to the appropriate Taxing Authority. In the case of a Tax that is
contested in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.7_ below, payment
of the Tax to the appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be
due earlier than the date a final determination to such effect is made by the
appropriate Taxing Authority or court. 

(e) The parties agree that any indemnification payment made pursuant to this
_Section 5.6_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for
Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(f) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this _Section 5.6_ shall terminate at the close of business on the 30th
day following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with
respect to the Tax liabilities in question.

 

(g) Any disputes between the parties with respect to the Tax matters regarding
the Sold Companies in _Section 5.5_, this _Section 5.6_ or _Section 5.7_
shall be resolved by the Accounting Firm, whose fees and expenses shall be
shared in accordance with _Section 2.5(e)_.

 

(h) For purposes of _Section 5.6(a)(i)_, the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be: (i) in the case of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (such as real or
personal property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the entire period (or,
in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such
Taxes for the immediately preceding period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date and the denominator of 

 



57  which is the number of calendar days in the entire relevant Straddle Period
and (ii) in the case of Taxes not described in (i) above (such as franchise
Taxes, Taxes that are based upon or related to income or receipts, based upon
occupancy or imposed in connection with any sale or other transfer or
assignment of property (real or personal, tangible or intangible)), the amount
of any such Taxes shall be determined as if such taxable period ended as of
the close of business on the Closing Date.

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Closing Date, and in any
event, within ninety (90) days thereof, Seller shall prepare and deliver to
Buyer a statement setting forth its calculation of the Incremental Deferred
Tax Liability. After receipt of such statement, Buyer shall have the right to
review and object to Sellers calculation in the same manner as is applicable
to Seller pursuant to the provisions of _Section 2.5(b)_, _mutatis mutandis_.

 

SECTION 5.7 _Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims_.

 

(a) If a Tax claim, audit, examination, notice of deficiency or other
adjustment, assessment or redetermination shall be made or threatened against
Buyer or Seller, as the case may be, or any of their Affiliates by any Taxing
Authority, which, if successful, would result in an indemnity payment pursuant
to _Section 5.6(a)_ or _(b)_ (a " _Tax Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party
shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party in writing of such Tax Claim
stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim and the amount thereof, to the
extent known by the Indemnified Party. If notice of a Tax Claim is not given
to the Indemnifying Party within a sufficient period of time to allow the
Indemnifying Party to effectively contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable
detail to apprise the Indemnifying Party of the nature of the Tax Claim, in
each case taking into account the facts and circumstances with respect to
such Tax Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party or any of their Affiliates to the extent that the Indemnified Partys
ability to effectively contest such Tax Claim is materially prejudiced as a
result thereof.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates (i) to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period for which Seller would be responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_ or
(ii) to a Tax related to Sellers or its Affiliates (other than any of the
Sold Companies) U.S. federal and any other affiliated, consolidated,
combined, or unitary income Tax Returns in respect of any of the Sold
Companies for any Straddle Period, Seller shall have the right to control at
its sole expense all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim
(including selection of counsel) (a " _Seller-Controlled Tax Claim_ "), but
shall not, without the prior written approval of Buyer, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, agree or consent to compromise or
settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any
issue or claim arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to
any Tax liability, to the extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent
or agreement increases (i) the Tax liability of Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (other than any Sold Company) or (ii) the Tax liability of any Sold
Company with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for which
Buyer would be responsible pursuant to  _Section 5.6(b)_.

 



58 (c) With respect to any Tax Claim that is not a Seller-Controlled Tax
Claim, Buyer shall have the right to control at its sole expense all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel); provided, however, in the event such Tax Claim relates to the
Straddle Period for which Buyer seeks indemnification pursuant to _Section
5.6(a)_, (i) Seller shall have the right (but not the obligation) to fully
participate in such Tax Claim at Sellers expense and (ii) Buyer shall not,
without the prior written approval of Seller, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, agree or consent to compromise or settle,
either administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any issue or
claim arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax
liability.

(d) If any Tax Claim (other than with respect to any consolidated, combined,
unitary or similar Tax Return of which the Seller or its Affiliate (other
than any of the Sold Companies) is the common parent) includes multiple Tax
periods and Buyer, one the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, would each
otherwise control such Tax Claim relating to any one of such Tax periods
pursuant to _Section 5.7(b)_ and _Section 5.7(c)_, Buyer and Seller shall
use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the relevant taxing authority to
separate such Tax Claim between the respective Tax periods; _provided_ ,
_however_ , if such Tax Claim cannot be separated between the respective Tax
periods, Buyer shall have the right to control at its sole expense all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of
counsel); provided that, (i) Seller shall have the right (but not the
obligation) to fully participate in such Tax Claim at Sellers expense and
(ii) Buyer shall not, without the prior written approval of Seller, not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, agree or consent to compromise
or settle, either administratively or after the commencement of litigation,
any issue or claim arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent
to any Tax liability.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
after the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any Affiliate of Buyer (including,
after the Closing, the Sold Companies) shall, without the prior written
consent of Seller (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), file or cause to be filed (i) any amended Tax Return, (ii) any
claim for Tax refund or (iii) any Tax election, with respect to the Sold
Companies (or relating to its income, properties or operations), if any such
filing could have the effect, as reasonably determined in good faith by
Seller, of (i) increasing the Tax liability of Seller or any of its Affiliates
(other than any Sold Company) (or, in each case, otherwise disadvantaging such
party) or (ii) increasing the Tax liability of any Sold Company with respect
to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for which Seller would be
responsible pursuant to _Section 5.6(a)_.

 

SECTION 5.8 _Refunds and Tax Benefits_.

 

(a) To the extent not taken into account in the calculation of Net Working
Capital, any Tax refunds that are received by Buyer, or, after the Closing,
the Sold Companies, and any amounts credited against Tax to which Buyer or the
Sold Companies become entitled, that relate to a Tax for which Seller is
responsible pursuant

 



59  to _Section 5.6(a)_ shall be for the account of Seller and Buyer shall
promptly pay over to Seller (to one or more accounts designated by Seller) the
amount of any such refund or any such credit within five (5) days after the
receipt or entitlement thereto, net of (i) any Taxes of Buyer and its
Affiliates (including the Sold Companies) attributable to such Tax refund and
(ii) any reasonable costs and expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Sold Companies) in obtaining such Tax refund. Buyer agrees that
it shall not, without Sellers prior written consent, cause or permit the Sold
Companies to carry back to any taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date any net operating loss, loss from operations or other Tax
attribute, and further agrees that Seller shall have no obligation under this
Agreement to return or remit any refund or other Tax benefit attributable to
a breach by Buyer of the foregoing undertaking.

(b) At the request of Seller, Buyer shall file or cause to be filed
at Sellers sole expense, an amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund with
respect to Taxes of the Sold Companies for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or for
any Straddle Period; _provided_ that Buyer shall have no obligation to file
any amended Tax Return or claim for Tax refund that would, as reasonably
determined in good faith by Buyer, increase the Tax liability of any Sold
Company with respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof) for which
Buyer would be responsible pursuant to  _Section 5.6(b)_, except as required
by applicable Law.

SECTION 5.9 _Employees; Benefit Plans_.

 

(a) _Business Employees_. Buyer shall (or shall cause the Sold Companies to)
continue to employ effective as of the Closing Date, each Business Employee
(i) identified on _Exhibit D_ (which shall be updated by Seller no later than
five (5) Business Days prior to Closing) or (ii) who is employed on the
Closing Date. Business Employees described in this _Section 5.9(a)_ who, by
operation of law, or as otherwise set out in this _Section 5.9(a)_, become
employees of Buyer or one of its Affiliates (including, as of the Closing, any
of the Sold Companies), shall collectively be the " _Transferred Employees_
". Buyer shall indemnify Seller and hold Seller harmless against any

provide Buyer with evidence of the DT 401(k) Plan termination including duly
adopted board resolutions of the sponsoring employer and any requisite plan
amendments as and when any such documents or

 



60  filings are completed. Buyer shall have reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the form and substance of the documents prepared in connection with
the DT 401(k) Plan termination. Buyer shall take any and all necessary
actions to permit the Transferred Employees that are entitled to receive an
"eligible rollover distribution" (as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4)) from
any Company Group Plan that is a defined contribution 401(k) savings plan,
including the DT 401(k) Plan, to roll over such eligible rollover
distribution, including any associated participant loans, as part of any lump
sum cash distribution into an account under a defined contribution 401(k)
savings plan maintained by Buyer or one of its Affiliates (the " _Buyer 401(k)
Plan_ "), subject to and in accordance with the provisions of such plan and
applicable Law, effective no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days
following the Closing Date (or such later time as mutually agreed by the

liabilities with respect to, or receive any right or interest in any trusts
relating to, assets of or any insurance administration or other contracts, or
related obligations pertaining to any Company Group Plan that is not a Sold
Company Benefit Plan, and the Seller shall remain solely responsible for and
shall indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer and its Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees and agents for any and all costs, expenses or Losses
under, in connection with or relating to any Company Group Plan that is not a
Sold Company Benefit Plan, regardless of when any such costs, expenses or
Losses arise, are incurred, are reported or are disclosed, including any
obligations for employment or other taxes and social or national insurance
contributions or similar obligations in connection with any payment made or
benefits provided to Business Employees (or other employees) under any Company
Group Plan that is not a Sold Company Benefit Plan.

(f) In those jurisdictions where there is a workers compensation program,
Buyers workers compensation program shall be responsible for all claims for
benefits that are based upon events occurring on or after the Closing by
participating Transferred Employees. Sellers workers compensation program
shall be responsible 

 



61  for all claims for benefits that are based upon events which occurred prior
to the Closing by participating Transferred Employees. To the extent that any
Business Employees who are receiving short-term disability benefits as of the
Closing are subsequently determined to be eligible for long-term disability
benefits, any obligations to provide such long-term disability benefits shall
be the responsibility of Seller or any long-term disability plan maintained
by Seller.

(g) Unless required to be paid by Seller under applicable law, Buyer shall
assume and honor all vacation days accrued for on the financial statements of
a Sold Company which have not yet been taken by Transferred Employees as of
the Closing Date (but only to the extent that such vacation days have been
accrued for by Seller and taken into account in the calculation of Net
Working Capital) and such vacation days may be used pursuant to Buyers
applicable vacation policies in effect as of the Closing Date and as
thereafter amended.

 

(h) Seller shall take all necessary action under the L-3 Communications
Holdings, Inc. 2008 Long Term Performance Plan and any other stock- or
equity-based compensation plan (collectively, the " _Seller LTPP_ ") to
accelerate the vesting of any awards granted to the Transferred Employees and
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (" _Transferred
Employee Awards_ "), such that the awards are vested as of the Closing Date in
proportion to each Transferred Employees days of service with Seller or its
Affiliates from the grant date of such awards through the Closing Date
divided by the total number of days required to become fully vested within the
normal time-vesting or restricted period applicable to the awards. The
Transferred Employee Awards, to the extent vested or exercisable, as
applicable, shall remain outstanding or be settled in accordance with the
terms of the applicable award agreement and the Seller LTPP.

(i) Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in communications with Business
Employees with respect to employee compensation and benefit plans maintained

with the Transactions.

 

(j) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that except as set forth in

construed to limit in any way the ability of Buyer or its Subsidiaries to
terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee from and after the
Closing; _provided_ that such termination is in accordance with applicable
Law.

(k) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Without limiting the generality of
_Section 10.13_, nothing in this _Section 5.9_, express or implied, is
intended to confer any third party beneficiary or other rights, benefits,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under this Agreement upon any Person
(including any Transferred Employees or other current or former Business
Employees), including any right to employment or continued employment for any
specified period or continued participation in any Company Group Plan or any
employee benefit plans, programs, policies or arrangements that are

 



62  sponsored or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates, of any nature or kind
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 5.9_. No provision of this
_Section 5.9_ is intended to and such provisions do not modify, amend or
create any employee compensation or benefit plan of the Seller, Buyer or any
of their respective Affiliates.

 

(l) _Cooperation_. Each of Buyer and Seller recognize it to be in the best
interests of the parties hereto and their respective employees that the
transactions in this _Section 5.9_ be effected in an orderly manner and agree
to devote their respective commercially reasonable efforts and to cooperate
fully in complying with the provisions of this  _Section 5.9_. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties agrees to
execute, deliver and file all documents and to take all such actions as are
deemed necessary or desirable in order to carry out and perform the purpose
of this _Section 5.9_ and to facilitate the transactions referred to in this
_Section 5.9_. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to and
after the Closing Date, the parties shall reasonably cooperate to comply with
and satisfy any requirement or custom to consult with or provide information
to, with respect to any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
any labor organization representing or related to Transferred Employees.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, the Seller shall, upon written
request from Buyer, provide to Buyer such information relating to the Business
Employees or the benefits and compensation from time to time provided to the
Business Employees as may be reasonably requested by Buyer to facilitate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the transaction of any
applicable human resources processes, or Buyers compliance with its
obligations under this  _Section 5.9_.

(a) Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any required
notification to, or any required consultation with, the Business Employees of
the Sold Companies, employee representatives, work councils, unions, labor

shall indemnify and hold Buyer harmless from any liabilities or
obligations arising out of or relating to Sellers failure, prior to Closing,
to notify and/or consult with any applicable employee representative, works
council, union, labor board, relevant government agency or similar body
required under applicable Law. 

(b) Buyer agrees to provide any required notice under the WARN Act or any
other applicable Law and to otherwise comply with any applicable statute with
respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or
other applicable Law) or similar event affecting Transferred Employees and
occurring on or after the Closing Date or arising as a result of the
Transactions. Buyer shall assume sole responsibility for any liabilities or
obligations arising under the WARN Act or other applicable Law resulting from
the actions (or inactions) of the Buyer or its Affiliates on or after the
Closing Date or from the Transactions. Seller agrees to provide any required
notice under the WARN Act and any other applicable Law and to otherwise comply
with any applicable statute with respect to any "plant closing" or 

 



63  "mass layoff" (as defined in the WARN Act or other applicable Law) or
similar event affecting Business Employees and occurring prior to the Closing
Date. Seller shall assume sole responsibility for any liabilities or
obligations arising under the WARN Act or other applicable Law resulting from

Date with respect to any terminations of employment which are implemented
prior to the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.11 _Permits_. Seller shall, and shall cause the Sold Companies to,

SECTION 5.12 _Non-Competition; Non-Solicitation_.

 

(a) Restrictions on Competing Activities Following Closing.

 

(i) For a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date, Seller
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or
indirectly as a stockholder, investor, member, partner or otherwise, own,
manage, operate or engage in any business (including any Person that engages
in the business) in competition with the Business as conducted immediately
prior to the Closing anywhere in the world. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
this _Section 5.12(a)_ shall not prohibit: (A) Seller, directly or through
any Affiliate, from designing, developing, manufacturing or selling Non-
Competitive Products; (B) Seller, directly or through any Affiliate, from
investing in or holding publicly traded securities of any Person engaged in a
business competitive to the Business to the extent such investment or holding
does not, directly or indirectly, confer on Seller and any Affiliate of
Seller more than 5% of the voting power of such Person; or (C) Seller,
directly or through any Affiliate, from hereafter acquiring or investing in
any entity or business which has operations that compete with the Business if
such operations account for less than the greater of (x) 25% of such entitys
consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended immediately prior to such
acquisition (provided that this  _Section 5.12(a)(i)(C)_ shall not be deemed
to be violated if such operations account for more than 25% of such entitys
consolidated revenues if within twelve (12) months following the consummation
of such acquisition Sellers or any of its Affiliates activities that
compete with the Business account for less than 25% percent of such entitys
consolidated annual revenues for the then most recently completed fiscal year)
and (y) $200,000,000 in consolidated revenues for the fiscal year ended
immediately prior to the date of such acquisition or investment, and, in each
case contemplated and permitted by this clause (C), Seller divests, or shall
cause such Affiliate to divest, such operations within twelve (12) months of
acquiring or investing in such business. In the event that Seller or any of
its Affiliates shall sell to a Person any portion of their respective
businesses (whether by means of acquisition, asset purchase, merger,
consolidation, similar business combination or otherwise), the restrictions
contained in this _Section 5.12(a)(i)_ shall not prohibit such sale and shall
not apply to any such Person or such Persons Affiliates;  _provided_ that
Seller shall continue to be bound by this _Section 5.12(a)(i)_ following such
sale.

 



64 (ii) For a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing
Date, Seller agrees that it will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries
(including through its and their respective officers, directors and employees)
not to, directly or indirectly:

 

(A) request, induce or attempt to influence any of the Business Employees to
terminate his or her employment with or service to Buyer or any Sold Company
or their Affiliates;

(B) attempt to dissuade any Business Employee from continuing employment with
Buyer or the Sold Companies or their Affiliates, as the case may be; or

(C) hire or employ or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to (in any case whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise)
any Business Employee who is then employed by Buyer or the Sold Companies or
their Affiliates, or any Person who is covered by the immediately following
sentence. The restrictions of clause (C) of this _Section 5.12(a)(ii)_ shall
cease to apply to a Business Employee twelve (12) months after the date of
termination of his or her employment with Buyer, any Sold Companies or any of
their Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 5.12(a)(ii)(C)_ shall restrict or
preclude Seller or any of its Affiliates from making generalized searches for
employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media)
or by engaging search firms that are not targeted at any such Business
Employees.

(iii) For a period of eighteen (18) months from and after the Closing Date,
Buyer agrees that it will not, and will cause the Sold Companies and each of
Buyers and the Sold Companies respective Affiliates (including through its
and their respective officers, directors and employees) not to, directly or
indirectly, use confidential information obtained from the Transferred
Employees relating to the business of Seller as of the date hereof (other than
the Business) in order to:

 

(A) request, induce or attempt to influence any Seller Restricted Employee to
terminate his or her employment with or service to Seller or its Affiliates;

(B) attempt to dissuade any Seller Restricted Employee from continuing
employment with Seller or its Affiliates, as the case may be; or

(C) hire or employ or solicit the employment of, or make or extend any offer
of employment to (in any case whether as an employee, consultant or otherwise)
any executive employee of Seller or its Affiliates

 



65  or any employee of Seller or its Affiliates assigned to a Novated Contract
and listed on _Schedule 5.12(a)(iii)(C)_ , who Buyer or any of the Sold
Companies or any their respective Affiliates, officers, directors or
employees (any such Person, a " _Buyer Soliciting Party_ ") has knowledge of
as a result of any Transferred Employees relationship or familiarity with the
employees of Seller or its Affiliates (any of the foregoing, a " _Seller
Restricted Employee_ "), or any Person who is covered by the immediately
following sentence. The restrictions of clause (C) of this _Section
5.12(a)(iii)_ shall cease to apply to a Seller Restricted Employee twelve
(12) months after the date of termination of his or her employment with Seller
and its Affiliates. Nothing in this _Section 5.12(a)(iii)(C)_ shall restrict
or preclude Buyer, any of the Sold Companies or any of Buyers or the Sold
Companies respective Affiliates from making generalized searches for
employees by the use of advertisements in the media (including trade media) or
by engaging search firms that are not targeted at any such employees of
Seller or its Affiliates.

(iv) The parties mutually agree that this _Section 5.12(a)_ is reasonable in
scope and duration in light of the nature, size and locations of the Business
and necessary to protect and preserve Buyers and Sellers legitimate business
interests and the value of the Business (including its goodwill) and the Sold
Shares and Sellers other businesses, and to prevent any unfair advantage
conferred on any party and their respective successors. It is the desire and
intent of the parties that the provisions of this _Section 5.12(a)_
be enforced to the fullest extent permissible under applicable Law.

(b) If a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction determines that any term
or provision contained in this _Section 5.12_ is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, then the parties agree that the court or tribunal will have the
power (but without affecting the right of Seller or Buyer to obtain the
relief provided for in this _Section 5.12_ in any jurisdiction other than
such courts or tribunals jurisdiction) to reduce the scope, duration or
geographic area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases
or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision. To the extent
it may effectively do so under applicable Law, each of Buyer and Seller
hereby waives on its own behalf and on behalf of its successors, any provision
of Law which renders any provision of this _Section 5.12_ invalid, void or
unenforceable in any respect.

(c) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees that the remedy of
indemnity payments and the other remedies at law for any breach of the
requirements of this _Section 5.12_ would be inadequate, and agrees and
consents that without intending to limit any additional remedies that may be
available, temporary and permanent injunctive and other equitable relief may
be granted without proof of actual damage or inadequacy of legal remedy and
without the posting of a bond, in any proceeding which may be brought to
enforce any of the provisions of this _Section 5.12_.

 



66 SECTION 5.13 _Release of Guaranties_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller and
Buyer shall cooperate and shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to, effective as of the Closing Date, terminate or cause to be terminated, in
each case without obligation or liability on the part of Seller or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Sold Companies) (collectively, the " _Seller
Guarantors_ "), or cause Buyer or one of its Affiliates to be substituted for
such Seller Guarantor, in respect of all liabilities and obligations of the
Seller Guarantors under guarantees of or relating primarily to obligations or
liabilities (including under any Contract or letter of credit or relating to
any Leased Real Property) of the Business and the Sold Companies, including
those listed on _Schedule 5.13_ (the " _Guaranties_ "). In the event the
foregoing actions are not completed by the Closing Date, then Buyer shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Seller Guarantors from and against all Losses
incurred by any such Person as a result of such failure and from and against
any continuing obligations and liabilities under any such Guaranties, except
for Losses arising from any acts or omissions of a Seller Guarantor. Moreover,
Seller and Buyer shall continue to cooperate and use their respective
reasonable best efforts to terminate as provided above, or cause Buyer or one
of its Affiliates to be substituted in all respects for the Seller Guarantors
in respect of, all obligations of the Seller Guarantors under any such
Guaranties, and Buyer shall (a) indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Guarantors for any amounts which become payable under such Guaranties after
Closing and (b) not and shall not permit the Business, the Sold Companies or
their Affiliates to (i) renew or extend the term of or (ii) increase its
obligations under, or transfer to another third party, any loan, lease,
Contract or other obligation for which any Seller Guarantor is liable under
such Guaranty unless the Buyer, the Sold Companies or their respective
Affiliates are substituted in all respects for the Seller Guarantors, and the
Seller Guarantors are released in respect of all obligations of the Seller
Guarantors, under such Guaranties. To the extent that any Seller Guarantor
has performance obligations under any such Guaranty, Buyer shall use
reasonable best efforts to (x) perform, or cause its Affiliates to perform,
such obligations on behalf of such Seller Guarantor or (y) otherwise take such
action as reasonably requested by Seller so as to put such Seller Guarantor
in the same position as if Buyer or one of its Affiliates, and not such Seller
Guarantor, had performed or were performing such obligations, in each case
after Closing. To fulfill the obligations of Buyer under this _Section
5.13_, Buyer shall not be obligated to pay any consent fee or similar payment.

 

SECTION 5.14 _Further Assurances_. Subject to _Section 5.3_, each of the
parties hereto shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take, or
cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do or cause to be done all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law, and execute and deliver
such documents and other papers, as may be required or reasonably requested
to consummate or give effect to the Transactions, including the Pre-Closing
Transfers.

SECTION 5.15  _Intercompany Payables and Receivables; Intercompany Debt_.

67  will be transferred to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Sold Companies) in connection with the Pre-Closing Transfers and, as a result,
will be between two or more of Seller and/or its Subsidiaries (other than the
Sold Companies) following the Pre-Closing Transfers (such receivables and
payables, the " _Intercompany Payables and Receivables_ ") shall be paid and
satisfied by the party that is the obligor and eliminated by payment thereof
in cash prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ that any such Intercompany
Payables and Receivables to be paid and satisfied prior to the Effective Time
may, at Sellers option and to the extent permitted under applicable Law, be
settled by way of deemed contributions, in the case of payables, and/or deemed
dividends, in the case of receivables. Prior to the Effective Time, to the
extent possible and permissible under applicable Law, net cash of the Sold
Companies may be distributed under the form of capital reductions or dividends
or may be lent to other Sold Companies that would otherwise be in a borrowing
position vis-a-vis Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Sold Companies) or may be otherwise removed from any Sold Company pursuant to
_Section 5.15(c)_.

(b) To the extent permissible under applicable Law, to the extent that there

party that is the obligor thereof in cash prior to the Effective Time.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, Seller may, in its sole discretion,
cause Cash of each Sold Company to be removed from such Sold Company by means
of a dividend to the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Sold
Companies) to the extent permissible under applicable Law.

 

SECTION 5.16 _Shared Contracts_. To the extent that any Contract (other than
Contracts set forth on _Schedule 5.16_ ) to which any Sold Company is a party
contains any right or obligation that relates to any business of Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries (other than the Sold Companies) other than the Business,
including any right of the counterparty to set-off amounts owed to the
Business or the Sold Companies against amounts owed to such counterparty by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Sold Companies) with respect
to any of their businesses other than the Business, Seller and Buyer shall use
their reasonable best efforts, including cooperating with the other party, to
amend, modify or split such Contract such that the rights or obligations of
such Contract to which such Sold Company is a party relate only to the
Business or otherwise terminate or eliminate any such obligations prior to
the Closing, or if not completed prior to Closing, as promptly as practicable
thereafter. Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Sold Companies) from and against all Losses arising out of,
relating to or resulting from any Contract to which any Sold Company is a
party to the extent such Losses arise out of, relate to or result from any
business of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Sold Companies)
other than the Business. Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
its Affiliates from and against all Losses arising out of, relating to or
resulting from any such Contract to which any Sold Company is a party to the
extent such Losses arise out of, relate to or result from the Business after
Closing.

Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes. Buyer and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate to minimize or eliminate any Transfer Taxes that might be imposed to
the extent permitted by applicable Law.

(a) For a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall not, and
shall not permit the Sold Companies to, amend, repeal or otherwise modify any
provision in any Sold Companys certificate of formation, certification of
incorporation, articles of incorporation, operating agreement, bylaws, or
equivalent governing documents relating to the exculpation or indemnification
(including fee advancement) of any officers and/or directors (collectively,
the " _D andO Indemnified Parties_") (unless required by Law), it being the
intent of the parties that the officers and directors of the Sold Companies
shall continue to be entitled to such exculpation and indemnification

insurance policies as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring
prior to the Closing. Such policy shall provide coverage that is at least
equal to the coverage provided under the Sold Companies current directors
and officers liability insurance policies; _provided_ that the Seller may
substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing terms
and conditions which are no less advantageous in the aggregate to the
beneficiaries thereof so long as such substitution does not result in gaps or
lapses in coverage with respect to matters occurring prior to the Closing
Date.

 

(c) The rights of the DandO Indemnified Parties under this _Section 5.18_ shall
be in addition to any rights such DandO Indemnified Parties may have under the

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall (i) be permitted to supplement, amend,
modify, add to or create any section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules, with
respect to, (A) the discovery of any facts or circumstances occurring or
existing on or prior to the date of this Agreement that cause, or that would
reasonably be expected to cause, any of the representations and warranties of
the Seller to be untrue or incorrect in any material respect as of the date of
this Agreement (a " _Prior Event Disclosure_ ") and (B) any development or
change of facts or circumstances that occurs after the date of this Agreement
that would cause, or would reasonably be expected to cause, any of the
representations or warranties of the Seller to be untrue or incorrect in any
material respect as of Closing (a " _Subsequent Event Disclosure_ "), (ii)
not later than the third (3rd) or earlier than the fifth (5th) Business Day
prior to the Closing Date, supplement, amend, modify, add to or create any
section of the Seller Disclosure Schedules with respect to any Prior Event
Disclosure or Subsequent Event Disclosure (the " _Pre-Closing Disclosure
Schedules_ ") and deliver the Pre-Closing Disclosure Schedules to Buyer on
such date, and (iii) following the delivery of the Pre-Closing Disclosure
Schedules but prior to the Closing Date (the " _Pre-Closing Disclosure Period_
"), use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Buyer of any Prior Event
Disclosure or Subsequent Event Disclosure which Seller discovers during the
Pre-Closing Disclosure Period. Each Prior Event Disclosure and Subsequent
Event Disclosure shall specify in reasonable detail the underlying facts
that were discovered or the development or change of facts and the applicable
representations and warranties to which such Prior Event Disclosure or
Subsequent Event Disclosure, as applicable, relates. No such supplement,
amendment, modification or addition to or creation of any Schedule shall be
evidence, in and of itself, that the representations and warranties in the
corresponding Section are no longer true and correct.

 



71 (b) In the case of any Prior Event Disclosure, no such supplement, amendment
or addition to any Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose of
determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and, for
the avoidance of doubt, no such supplement, amendment or addition to any
Schedule shall be effective to cure or correct any breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant by Seller, or constitute the waiver of
any indemnification or other rights of Buyer.

 

(c) In the case of any Subsequent Event Disclosure, no such supplement,
amendment or addition to any Schedule shall have any effect for the purpose
of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ and,
for the avoidance of doubt, no such supplement, amendment or addition to any
Schedule shall be effective to cure or correct any breach of
any representation, warranty or covenant by Seller, or constitute the waiver
of any indemnification or other rights of Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if such Subsequent Event Disclosure, either individually or with other Prior
Event Disclosures and Subsequent Event Disclosures, results in a failure of
the condition to Closing in _Section 7.1(b)_ to be satisfied and Buyer elects
to waive such failure and Closing occurs, then Buyers right to
indemnification for breaches of such representations and warranties or any
other indemnification obligations set forth in _Article IX_ hereof solely with
respect to such Subsequent Event Disclosure shall be waived in all respects
and Seller shall have no liability with respect thereto.

(d) Seller shall notify Buyer if it receives any written notice after the date
hereof that any material Permit will be suspended, terminated, revoked or
modified or cannot be renewed in the Ordinary Course of Business. Prior to
Closing, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list of Contracts entered into
after the date hereof which would have been "Material Contracts" for purposes
hereof had they been entered into on or before the date of this Agreement.

 

SECTION 5.23 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation; Nonassertion of
Attorney-Client Privilege_.

 

(a) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause its Affiliates
(including, after the Closing, the Sold Companies) to waive and not to
assert, any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the
representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or any shareholder, officer, employee
or director of Seller or any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a "
_Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement, the Closing
Agreements or the Transactions, by Simpson Thacher and Bartlett LLP (" _STB_
"), in its capacity as legal counsel currently representing Seller or any of
its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement, the Closing Agreements or
the Transactions (the " _Current Representation_ ").

 



72 (b) Buyer waives and shall not assert, and agrees to cause its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Sold Companies) to waive and to
not assert, any attorney-client privilege solely to the extent inherited as a
result of the Transactions with respect to any communication between STB and
any Designated Person occurring during the Current Representation prior to
the Closing Date in connection with any Post-Closing Representation, including
in connection with a dispute with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, and
following the Closing, with the Sold Companies, it being the intention of the
parties hereto that all such rights to such attorney-client privilege and to
control such attorney-client privilege shall be retained by Seller; _provided_
that the foregoing waiver and acknowledgement of retention shall not extend
to any communication not involving this Agreement or the Closing Agreements or
the Transactions, or to communications with any Person other than the
Designated Persons and their advisers or to any privilege otherwise held by
Buyer irrespective of the Transactions.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, after the Closing, in the event of a
dispute between Buyer, the Sold Company or any of their respective
Affiliates, on the one hand, and a Person other than Seller or its Affiliates,
on the other hand, the Sold Companies may assert the attorney-client privilege
to prevent the disclosure of such communications and files by its legal

confusingly similar thereto (the " _Seller Marks_ ") and diligently prosecute
such name changes thereafter; (ii) within thirty (30) days, remove the Seller
Marks from all websites, social and mobile media or other digital content in

or agents of the foregoing, in each case, solely in their representative
capacity with respect to Buyer and its Affiliates businesses) that alleges
that any such Persons use of any Seller Covered IP in connection with the
Business infringes, violates or misappropriates such Seller Covered IP. "

case, solely in their representative capacity with respect to Seller and
its Affiliates businesses) that alleges that any such Persons use of any
Buyer Covered IP in connection with their businesses other than the Business

processes, other than such items covered by the Patent License Agreement that
are (i) owned by the Sold Companies as of the Closing Date and (ii) used in
the businesses of Seller and its Affiliates other than the Business as of the
Closing Date.

(e) Prior to Closing, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate the grant by Invincea to the Sold Companies of the right to use the
third-party Invincea software application by the Sold Companies after Closing,

this _Section 5.25_, all such ITAR registrations and

 



74  licenses shall be obtained no later than the fifth (5th) day after the

governed by the immediately preceding sentence) as promptly as practicable
following the Closing.

 

SECTION 5.26 _Customer Visits_. During the Pre-Closing Period, without the
prior written consent of Seller (which may be withheld in its sole
discretion), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its officers, directors,
employees and other Representatives not to, contact any suppliers to, or
customers of, the Business in connection with or pertaining to the
Transactions. In the event Seller provides such consent, a management

contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, except in the case of the Sold

actions that Seller reasonably believes would cause any representation,
warranty, covenant or other obligation in this Agreement to be breached or
any condition to closing hereunder to fail to be satisfied, (5) such
assistance shall not require the waiver or amendment of any terms of this
Agreement or the payment of any fees or reimbursement of any expenses prior to

77 (b) Neither Seller, any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective

use commercially reasonable efforts to collect balances due on the Equatorial
Guinea Receivable. Buyer shall not, and shall not permit the Sold Companies
to, settle, compromise or agree to reduce the face amount of such

unreasonably withheld). For a period of sixty (60) days, commencing at the end
of such two (2) year period, Buyer shall have the right to require Seller to
purchase the Equatorial Guinea Receivable for a cash purchase price equal to
50% of the then uncollected face amount of the Equatorial Guinea Receivable;

days following Buyers written notice of such breach or inaccuracy or is not
capable of being cured on or prior to the Termination Date; _provided_ that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.1(a)(v)_ shall
not be available to Buyer if it is then in material breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, or other agreement contained herein; or

 

(vi) by Buyer if, since the date of this Agreement, there has been a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) In the event of termination by Seller or Buyer pursuant to this _Section
8.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given to the other and the
Transactions shall be terminated, without further action by any party. If the
Transactions are terminated as provided herein, Buyer shall return all
documents and other material received from Seller relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, whether so obtained before or after the
execution hereof, to Seller.

SECTION 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated and the
transactions contemplated hereby are abandoned as described in _Section 8.1_ ,
this Agreement shall become null and void and of no further force and effect,
without any liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto or their
respective directors, officers, employees, owners, Representatives or
Affiliates, and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned
without further action by the parties hereto, except for (i) the last
sentence of _Section 5.2_ (Access) and (ii) each of _Section 5.17_ (Expenses;
Transfer Taxes), _Section 8.1_ (Termination), _Section 8.2_ (Effect of
Termination) and _Article X_ (Miscellaneous), each of which, shall survive
such termination. Nothing in this _Section 8.2_ , however, shall be deemed to
release any party from any liability for any willful breach by such party of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement prior to termination. For purposes
of this _Section 8.2_ , " _willful_ " shall mean a breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by the breaching party with the knowledge
(actual or constructive) that the taking of such act would, or would
be reasonably expected to, cause a breach of this Agreement.

 



82 ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

SECTION 9.1  _Survival_. The representations and warranties contained in
_Article III_ and _Article IV_ shall survive the Closing and shall terminate
eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, except that (i) the
representations and warranties contained in the last sentence of _Section
3.22(d)_ shall survive the Closing until the fifth (5th) anniversary of the
Closing and (ii) the Seller Fundamental Representations, the Buyer
Fundamental Representations and the representations and warranties contained
in _Section 3.11_ [ _Tax Matters_ ] shall survive until thirty (30) days
after the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and shall
terminate eighteen (18) months after the Closing Date, unless a specific
covenant or agreement requires performance after such date, in which case
such covenant or agreement shall survive for a period of one (1) year
following the date on which the performance of such covenant or agreement is
required to be completed; provided that the covenants in _Section 5.6_ [
_Tax Indemnity_ ] shall survive until thirty (30) days after the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations. The obligation to indemnify and hold
harmless a party hereto in respect of a breach of representation or
warranty, covenant or agreement shall terminate on the expiration of the
applicable survival period for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement, unless the Indemnified Party shall have made a proper claim for
indemnification pursuant to this  _Article IX_ prior to such expiration date.

SECTION 9.2 _Indemnification by Seller_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this _Article IX_ , Seller
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Sold Companies) and their respective successors, permitted assigns,
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, representatives, members,
partners and agents (collectively, the " _Buyer Indemnified Persons_ ") from
and against, without duplication, any Losses incurred or suffered by any Buyer
Indemnified Person arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) any
breach of any of the representations or warranties made by Seller in 
_Article III_ of this Agreement or (ii) any breach of any of the covenants or
agreements of Seller in this Agreement.

 

(b) The obligation of Seller to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Persons for
Losses with respect to the matters contained in  _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ is
subject to the following limitations except with respect to Losses arising
from breach of the Seller Fundamental Representations: (i) Seller shall not be
required to provide indemnification to any Buyer Indemnified Person pursuant
to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_, unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred or
suffered by Buyer Indemnified Persons from the matters contained in _Section
9.2(a)(i)_ exceeds one-half percent (0.5%) of the Enterprise Value (the "
_Deductible_ "), whereupon Seller shall be liable for all amounts in excess of
the Deductible; (ii) the Buyer Indemnified Persons shall have no right to
indemnification under _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ with respect to any claim or
series of substantially related claims for which the sum of all Losses with
respect thereto is less than $50,000 (for the avoidance of doubt, such claim
or series of related claims for 

 



83  which the sum of all Losses with respect thereto is less than $50,000 shall
not count towards the Deductible); and (iii) in no event shall the aggregate
amount of Losses for which Seller is obligated to indemnify Buyer Indemnified
Persons pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)(i)_ exceed ten percent (10%) of the
Enterprise Value (the " _Cap_ "). In addition to the foregoing limitations,
(x) in no event shall Sellers indemnification obligations under _Section
9.2(a)_ and _Section 5.6(a)_ exceed, in the aggregate, the Final Purchase
Price and (y) the Deductible shall not apply to any Losses incurred or
suffered by Buyer Indemnified Persons arising from breach of _Section 3.20_
[ _Affiliate Relationships_ ] or _Section 3.21_ [ _Sufficiency of Assets_ ].
For the avoidance of doubt, except for the previous sentence, none of the
limitations set forth in this _Section 9.2(b)_ shall apply to claims for
indemnification under _Section 5.6(a)_ or _Section 9.2(a)(ii)_, a claim
arising out of or relating to a breach of the Seller Fundamental
Representations, or claims for fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 9.2(b)_, in the event of a claim for breach of
_Section 5.22(a_) [ _Notification of Certain Matters_ ] for failure to
provide Buyer with a relevant Prior Event Disclosure or Subsequent Event
Disclosure, such claim shall be subject to the limitations (and exceptions)
set forth in this _Section 9.2(b)_ as if such breach of _Section 5.22(a)_
were a breach of the representations and warranties underlying the Prior
Event Disclosure or Subsequent Event Disclosure required to be delivered to
Buyer (except to the extent such breach was done willfully or intentionally,
in which case such limitations and exceptions will not apply).

SECTION 9.3 _Indemnification by Buyer_.

 

(a) Following the Closing, subject to the terms of this _Article IX_ , Buyer
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates (excluding
the Sold Companies) and their respective successors, permitted assigns,
stockholders, officers, directors, employees, representatives, members,
partners and agents (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnified Persons_ " and,
together with the Buyer Indemnified Persons, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") from
and against Losses incurred or suffered by any Seller Indemnified Person
arising out of, relating to or resulting from (i) any breach of any of the
representations or warranties made by Buyer in _Article IV_ of this Agreement
or (ii) any breach of any of the covenants or agreements of Parent or Buyer in
this Agreement.

 

(b) The obligation of Buyer to indemnify the Seller Indemnified Persons for
Losses with respect to the matters contained in  _Section 9.3(a)_ is subject
to the following limitations except with respect to Losses arising from breach
of the Buyer Fundamental Representations: (i) Buyer shall not be required to
provide indemnification to any Seller Indemnified Person pursuant to _Section
9.3(a)(i)_, unless the aggregate amount of Losses incurred or suffered by
Seller Indemnified Persons from the matters contained in _Section 9.3(a)(i)_
exceeds the Deductible, whereupon Buyer shall be liable for all amounts for
which indemnification may be sought; (ii) the Seller Indemnified Persons shall
have no right to indemnification under _Section 9.3(a)(i)_ with respect to
any claim or series of substantially related claims for which the sum of all
Losses with respect thereto is less than $50,000 (for the avoidance of doubt,
such claim or series of claims for which the sum of all Losses with respect
thereto is less than $50,000 shall not count towards the Deductible); and
(iii) in no event shall the aggregate amount of Losses for

 



84  which Buyer is obligated to indemnify Seller Indemnified Persons pursuant to
_Section 9.3(a)(i)_ exceed the Cap. In addition to the foregoing limitations,
in no event shall Buyers indemnification obligations under _Section 9.3(a)_
exceed, in the aggregate, the Final Purchase Price. For the avoidance of
doubt, except for the previous sentence, none of the limitations set forth in
this _Section 9.3(b)_ shall apply to claims for indemnification under
_Section 9.3(b)(ii)_, a claim arising out of or relating to a breach of the
Buyer Fundamental Representations or claims for fraud.

 

SECTION 9.4 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") to the party or parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ ") after the Indemnified Party first becomes aware of any
event or other facts (including any Third Party Claim) that has resulted or
that might result in any Loss for which the Indemnified Party is entitled to
any indemnification under _Section 9.2_ and _Section 9.3_, subject to the
terms and conditions of this _Article IX_ (such claim, an " _Indemnification
Claim_ "), and such Claim Notice shall contain (i) a reasonably detailed
description and, if known, the estimated amount of any Loss incurred or
reasonably expected to be incurred by the Indemnified Party together with such
supporting documents reasonably available to such Indemnified Party, (ii) a
reasonable explanation of the basis for the Indemnification Claim to the
extent of the facts then known by the Indemnified Party, and (iii) a demand
for payment of such Loss; _provided_ , that failure to give such notification
shall not affect such Indemnified Partys right to indemnification hereunder
and shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party from any of its obligations under
this _Article IX_ except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is actually
prejudiced by such failure.

(b) After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant hereto, the
Indemnifying Party shall respond within twenty (20) Business Days after
receipt thereof (the " _Claim Response_ "). Any Claim Response must specify
whether the Indemnifying Party disputes the Indemnification Claim described in
the Claim Notice and the basis of such dispute. If the Indemnifying Party
does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days
following its receipt of such Claim Notice that such Indemnifying Party
disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ ,
such Indemnification Claim specified in the Claim Notice shall be conclusively
deemed a Loss of the Indemnifying Party under this _Article IX_ and the amount
specified in the Claim Notice shall be payable by the Indemnifying Party to
the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the
amount of the Indemnification Claim (or any portion thereof) is estimated, on
such later date when the amount of such Indemnification Claim (or
such portion thereof) becomes finally determined.

(c) If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with
respect to such claim through the delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to negotiate in good faith a resolution of such dispute and, if not
timely resolved through negotiations within twenty (20) days after the
conclusion of the twenty (20) Business Day response period, such dispute shall
be resolved in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with _Section
10.14_. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction shall be final and binding not be subject to appeal.

(d) Any amounts payable by Seller or Buyer to the Indemnified Party as so
finally determined shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available
funds within ten (10) Business Days after such final determination.

 



85 SECTION 9.5 _Notice and Opportunity to Defend_. If there occurs an
indemnifiable event which involves any claim or the commencement of any
action or proceeding by a third Person, including any Governmental Authority
(a " _Third Party Claim_ "), the Indemnified Party will give such Indemnifying
Party prompt written notice of such Third Party Claim or the commencement
thereof. The failure to provide prompt notice as provided herein will relieve
the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder only if, and to the extent
that, such failure actually prejudices the Indemnifying Party hereunder. In
the event that an action is brought against an Indemnified Party and such
Indemnified Party has notified the Indemnifying Party of the commencement
thereof pursuant to this _Section 9.5_ , the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to assume the defense thereof, with counsel selected by the
Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall
not be entitled to assume the defense (unless otherwise agreed to in writing
by the Indemnified Party) if (i) the Third Party Claim relates primarily to
any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or investigation, (ii)
the Third Party Claim primarily seeks an injunction or equitable relief
against the Indemnified Party, (iii) the Losses relating to the Third Party
Claim are reasonably likely to exceed the maximum amount that the Indemnified
Party could then be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying Party under the
applicable provisions of this Agreement, or (iv) the Third Party Claim is one
in which the Indemnifying Party is also a party and, based upon the advice of
counsel, joint representation would be inappropriate or there may be legal
defenses available to the Indemnified Party which are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party. After notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of such election to assume the
defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to
the Indemnified Party hereunder for any legal costs or expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except as otherwise provided in this
_Article IX_. The Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party agree to
cooperate fully with each other and their respective counsel in connection
with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such action or asserted
liability. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense of a Third
Party Claim as contemplated hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate in (but not control) at its own expense in the defense of
such action or asserted liability. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of an action, no settlement or compromise thereof may be effected (x)
by the Indemnifying Party without the written consent of the Indemnified Party
(unless (A) the settlement seeks only monetary relief and all such
relief provided is paid or satisfied in full by the Indemnifying Party, (B)
the settlement or compromise provides for a full release by the party of the
Indemnified Party with respect to the claim(s) being settled and (C) the
settlement or compromise does not contain any admission of finding or
wrongdoing on behalf of the Indemnified Party) or (y) by the Indemnified Party
without the consent of the Indemnifying Party. Except as contemplated
hereunder, in no event shall an Indemnified Party or an Indemnifying Party be
liable for any settlement or compromise effected without its prior written

 



86  consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the fees and expenses of
counsel employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed the defense thereof (other than during any
period in which the Indemnified Party shall have failed to give a Claim Notice
of the Third Party Claim as provided above). If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute any Third Party Claim, (1) the parties hereto
shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and (2) the Indemnifying
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts in the defense or settlement
of such Third Party Claim. Such cooperation shall include the retention and
(upon the Indemnifying Partys request) the provision to the Indemnifying
Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to such Third
Party Claim, and making officers, directors, employees and agents of the
Indemnified Party available on a mutually convenient basis to provide
information, testimony at depositions, hearings or trials, and such other
assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnifying Party.

SECTION 9.6 _Tax Indemnity_. Unless otherwise specifically provided in this
Agreement, indemnification with respect to Tax matters (including breach of
the representations and warranties set forth in _Section 3.11_ of this
Agreement or the covenants set forth in _Section 5.5_ of this Agreement) shall
be governed exclusively by _Section 5.5_ , _Section 5.6_ , _Section 5.7_ and
_Section 5.8_.

SECTION 9.7 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. The parties agree that
any indemnification payments made pursuant to this _Article IX_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

SECTION 9.8 _Additional Limitations_.

 

(a) Except as provided in _Section 5.22_, the right to indemnification or any
other remedy based on representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
in this Agreement or any Closing Agreement shall not be affected by any
investigation conducted at any time, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of
being acquired) at any time, whether before or after the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the accuracy
or inaccuracy of, or compliance with, any such representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

 

(b) In respect of any Loss for which indemnification may be sought pursuant to
this _Article IX_ , nothing herein shall relieve an Indemnified Party from
its duty to mitigate its Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition that would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder. If an Indemnified Party receives any payment in
respect of Losses after the Indemnifying Party has paid the Indemnified Party
under any indemnification provision of this Agreement in respect of such
Losses, the Indemnified Party shall notify the Indemnifying Party and pay to
the Indemnifying Party the extent of such payment (less the Indemnified
Partys reasonable costs of mitigation) within five (5) Business Days after
receipt. An Indemnified Partys right to indemnification pursuant to 
_Section 9.2_ or _Section 9.3_, as applicable, will be reduced by the amount
paid by a third party (including an insurance company or any third party owing
an indemnification or similar 

 



87  obligation to the Indemnified Party), or paid by such third party to another
for the account or benefit of Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, with
respect to the settlement or resolution of a claim for which Seller or Buyer,
as the case may be, was entitled to indemnification hereunder. The Indemnified
Party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue recovery from
such third parties and under all insurance policies (or similar obligations)
available to it in good faith and shall remit to the Indemnifying Party any
such insurance or other third party proceeds that are paid to the Indemnified
Parties with respect to Losses for which such Indemnified Parties have been
previously compensated pursuant to _Section 9.5_.

(c) The amount of any and all Losses shall be determined net of (i) any
amounts actually recovered by the Indemnified Party under insurance policies
with respect to such Losses, in each case, net of costs of collection
resulting from making any claim thereunder and (ii) any Tax Benefits.

 

(d) With respect to indemnification claims made under this _Article IX_ , for
purposes of calculating the amount of any Losses attributable to any such
breach, inaccuracy or noncompliance, all references to "material,"
"materiality," "material respects", "Company Material Adverse Effect" and
similar qualifications shall be disregarded.

SECTION 9.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except with respect to (i) claims for fraud,
(ii) disputes related to the Purchase Price adjustments in _Article II_
(which shall be governed exclusively by _Article II_ ), (iii) claims for Taxes
under _Section 5.6_ , or (iv) actions seeking injunctive and provisional
relief (including specific performance), the indemnification provisions
contained in this _Article IX_ , subject to the limitations set forth herein,
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy available to any party in connection
with any Losses arising out of or resulting from this Agreement or the
Transactions following the Closing. The foregoing notwithstanding, nothing in
this _Section 9.9_ shall limit or restrict the ability or right of any party
hereto to seek injunctive or other equitable relief for any breach or
alleged breach of any provision of _Articles II_ , _V_ , _IX_ or _X_ of this
Agreement; _provided_ , that any procedures in respect of and limitations on
Losses or liabilities in this _Article IX_ , to the extent applicable,
shall in no event be diminished or circumvented by such relief. Each party
acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the Closing, except as
contemplated in this _Section 9.9_ , the Indemnified Parties may not avoid any
limitation on liability hereunder with respect to the Transactions by seeking
damages for breach of contract, tort or pursuant to any other theory of
liability, all of which are hereby waived. The parties hereto agree that the
provisions in this Agreement relating to indemnification, and the limits
imposed on the remedies hereunder with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and
were specifically taken into account in the determination of the amounts to
be paid to Seller hereunder.

(including any claim, dispute, controversy or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in

the Seller Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule and may be
included elsewhere in this Agreement items which are not "material" within the
meaning of the immediately preceding sentence for informational purposes and
in order to avoid any misunderstanding, and such inclusion shall not be
deemed to be an agreement by Seller or Buyer that such items are "material" or
to further define the meaning of such term for purposes of this Agreement.
With respect to the Seller Disclosure Schedule and Buyer Disclosure Schedule
hereto, the disclosures made on any Schedule with respect to any

instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of such party. No failure to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute
a waiver of such provision and no waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver.

collaterally assign this Agreement to any Debt Financing Source or any party
providing bona fide debt financing to Buyer or its Affiliates.

(a) Seller and Buyer will consult with each other and will mutually agree upon
any publication or press release of any nature with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any such
publication or press release prior to such consultation and agreement except
as may be required by applicable Law or by any securities exchange, in which
case the party proposing to issue such publication or press release shall make
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the other party or parties
and to provide the other party with a reasonable opportunity to comment on
such publication or press release before issuing any such publication or
press release and shall provide a copy thereof to the other party or parties
prior to such issuance. The parties shall use reasonable efforts to consult in
good faith with the other party or parties with respect to any Securities and
Exchange Commission filing to be made in respect of the execution of this

(b) Except, and to the extent, as may be requested or required by applicable
Law (including securities laws of any jurisdiction and rules and regulations
of any applicable securities exchange) or legal, judicial or regulatory
process, from and after the date of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall
each keep confidential and not directly or indirectly disclose to any third
Person (other than its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, attorneys,
accountants, advisors, agents and other representatives, _provided_ , that
they shall be instructed to keep confidential) the terms and conditions of
this Agreement and the Closing Agreements.

 



91 (c) For a period of three (3) years, from the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates to, (a) treat all information relating to
Buyer, the Sold Companies or the Business as confidential, preserve the
confidentiality thereof, and not use or disclose to any Person such
information (except as expressly permitted by this Agreement and the other
Closing Agreements) and (b) use reasonable best efforts to cause its
directors, officers, employees, representatives or other agents who have had
access to such information to keep it confidential and not to use or disclose
to any Person any such information (except as expressly permitted by this
Agreement and the other Closing Agreements); _provided_ , _however_ , that,
all such information that constitutes trade secrets of the Sold Companies
that (i) relate exclusively to the Business and (ii) are maintained by Seller
as trade secrets as of the Closing Date, shall be subject to the foregoing
requirements for as long as such information remains a trade secret under
applicable Law. If the disclosure of such information is required by Law or by
rules and regulations promulgated by a listing exchange, the Seller shall
cooperate with and provide Buyer with an opportunity to object to the
disclosure and shall give Buyer as much prior written notice as is possible
under the circumstances. The Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to any
such information required by Law or such rules and regulations to be
disclosed.

(d) The provisions of _Section 10.10(c)_ shall not apply to any information
that is (i) generally available to the public or becomes available to the
public through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) developed independently
of and without reference to the information relating to the other
party; (iii) received from a third party who had a legal right to disclose
such information without restriction; or (iv) disclosed pursuant to applicable
Law or Order.

 

SECTION 10.11 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for

SECTION 10.17 _Enforcement of Agreement_.

 

(a) Each party acknowledges and agrees that, prior to the Closing, the other
party would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement
are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach
of this Agreement by Seller or Buyer could not be adequately compensated in
all cases by monetary damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other
right or remedy to which any party may be entitled at law or in equity, before
or after the Closing each party shall be entitled to enforce any provision of
this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary,
preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond
or other undertaking. Each of the parties hereto further agrees that it shall
not object to, or take any position inconsistent with respect to, whether in
a court of Law or otherwise, (i) the appropriateness of the specific
performance contemplated by this _Section 10.17_ and (ii) the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts set forth in _Section 10.14_ hereof with respect
to any action brought for any such remedy.

(b) Each party further agrees that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for
in this _Section 10.17_, a party shall not in any respect waive its right to
seek any other form of relief that may be available to such party under this
Agreement or in the event that the remedies provided for in this _Section
10.17_ are not available or otherwise are not granted, and (ii) nothing set
forth in this _Section 10.17_ shall require any party to institute any action
for (or limit any partys right to institute any action for) specific

 



93  performance under this _Section 10.17_ prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _Article VIII_ , nor shall the
commencement of any action pursuant to this  _Section 10.17_ or anything set
forth in this _Section 10.17_ restrict or limit any such partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Article VIII_ or pursue any other
remedies under this Agreement that may be available then or thereafter.

SECTION 10.18 _Construction; Cooperation_. The parties hereto have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. If an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement will
be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties hereto and no presumption or
burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any party hereto because
of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement. Any language from prior
drafts of this Agreement, to the extent not included in the definitive version
of this Agreement executed by the parties hereto, shall not be deemed to
reflect the intention of any party hereto, or otherwise serve as parol
evidence of any kind, with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

SECTION 10.19 _Debt Financing Party Arrangements_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto: (a)
agrees that it will not bring or support any Person, or permit any of its
Affiliates to bring or support any Person, in any action, suit, proceeding,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind
or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, against the Debt Financing Sources or any other Person that has
committed or subsequently commits to provide or otherwise enters into
agreements in connection with providing the Debt Financing to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, and each of its or their respective former, current and future
Affiliates, equityholders, members, partners, controlling persons, officers,
directors, employees, agents, advisors and representatives involved in such
debt financing (collectively, the " _Lender Parties_ ,") in any way relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to the Debt Financing Commitment or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, in any forum other than the federal and New
York State courts located in the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New
York; (b) agrees that, except as specifically set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, all claims or causes of action (whether at law, in equity, in
contract, in tort or otherwise) against any of the Lender Parties in any way
relating to the Debt Financing Commitment or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, shall be exclusively governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the internal laws of the State of New York,
without giving effect to principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of
laws of another jurisdiction; and (c) HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY
WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION (WHETHER AT LAW OR IN EQUITY, IN CONTRACT, IN TORT OR OTHERWISE)
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THE DEBT
FINANCING COMMITMENT OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF OR THE FINANCINGS
CONTEMPLATED THEREBY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, (i) the Seller and its respective subsidiaries, Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers, members or
stockholders (other than the Sold 

 



94  Companies after Closing) shall not have any rights or claims against any
Lender Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to have been made in connection herewith or therewith,
including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt
Financing Commitment or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise and (ii) no Lender Party shall have any liability (whether
in contract, in tort or otherwise) to Seller and its respective subsidiaries,
Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners, managers,
members or stockholders (other than the Sold Companies after Closing) for any
obligations or liability of any party hereto under this Agreement or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, the Lender Parties are intended third-party beneficiaries of,
and shall be entitled to the protections of this  _Section 10.19_, and
_Sections 10.1_ , _10.13_ and _10.14_ , which cross-reference this _Section
10.19_, to the same extent as if the Financing Sources were parties to this
Agreement. This _Section 10.19_, and _Sections 10.1_ , _10.13_ and _10.14_ ,
which cross-reference this _Section 10.19_, may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, or any of its provisions waived, without the written consent of
the Lender Parties, which consent may be granted or withheld in the sole
discretion of the Lender Parties.

SECTION 10.20 _Parent Guarantee_.

 

(a) Parent hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to
Seller the due and punctual payment, performance and discharge of all
obligations of Buyer under this Agreement and the Closing Agreements
(including payment of the Final Purchase Price and any damages for breach
arising under this Agreement and the Closing Agreements) (collectively, the "
_Obligations_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, this
guarantee is one of payment, not collection, and a separate action or actions
may be brought and prosecuted against Parent to enforce this
guarantee, irrespective of whether any action is brought against Buyer or
whether Buyer is joined in any such actions, and irrespective of whether Buyer
or any other Person was primarily responsible for causing the breach of the
Obligations. If Buyer fails to perform any of the Obligations requiring
payment, in whole or in part, when such Obligation is due, Parent shall
promptly pay such Obligation in lawful money of the United States and in any
event within five (5) Business Days of receipt of written demand for payment
from Seller. Seller may enforce Parents obligations under this _Section
10.20_ without first suing Buyer or joining Buyer in any suit against Parent,
or enforcing any rights and remedies against Buyer, or otherwise pursuing or
asserting any claims or rights against Buyer or any other Person or any of its
or their property which may also be liable with respect to the matters for
which Parent is liable under this _Section 10.20_ whether Buyer or any other
Person was primarily responsible for causing the breach of the Obligations of
Buyer.

(b) Parent agrees that its obligations hereunder shall not be released or
discharged, in whole or in part, or otherwise affected by (i) the existence of
any claim, set-off or other right which Parent may have at any time against
Buyer, whether in connection with the Obligations or otherwise; (ii) any
insolvency, bankruptcy,

 



95  reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting Buyer; (iii) the
failure of Seller to assert any claim or demand or to enforce any right or
remedy against Buyer; (iv) any change in the corporate existence, structure
or ownership of Buyer; (v) the adequacy of any other means Seller may have of
obtaining payment of any of the Obligations; or (vi) any change in the time,
place or manner of payment of any of the Obligations or any rescission,
waiver, compromise, consolidation or other amendment or modification of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement. Parent waives promptness,
diligence, notice of the acceptance of this guarantee and of the Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of any Obligations incurred and all other notices of any
kind, any right to require the marshalling of assets of Buyer, all defenses
which may be available by virtue of any valuation, stay, moratorium law or
other similar law now or hereafter in effect and all suretyship defenses
generally.

 

(c) Seller shall not be obligated to file any claim relating to the
Obligations in the event that Buyer becomes subject to a reorganization,
bankruptcy or similar proceeding, and the failure of Seller to so file shall
not affect Parents obligations. In the event that any payment to Seller in
respect of an Obligation is rescinded or must otherwise be returned, and
is returned, to Buyer in connection with any such proceeding, Parent shall
remain liable hereunder with respect to its Obligations as if such payment had
not been made.
