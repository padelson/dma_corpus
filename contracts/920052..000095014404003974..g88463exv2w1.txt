                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "Agreement") is made and
entered into on February 2, 2004 by and among Renal Care Group, Inc., a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"), Titan Merger Subsidiary, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("Merger Corp."), and National Nephrology Associates, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company"); and the holders of Company Equity Securities who
execute a counterpart signature page to this Agreement (the "Owners"). A list of
all Owners is attached hereto as Exhibit A and will be updated from time to time
as the Owners enter into this Agreement after the date hereof as contemplated
herein.

                                    PREAMBLE

         The Boards of Directors of the Company, Merger Corp. and Parent are of
the opinion that the transactions described in this Agreement are in the best
interests of the parties to this Agreement and their respective stockholders.
This Agreement provides for the acquisition of the Company by Parent pursuant to
the merger of Merger Corp. with and into the Company. At the effective time of
the merger, the outstanding shares and rights to acquire shares of the capital
stock of the Company will be converted into the right to receive a cash payment
from Parent and a contingent right to a deferred payment from an escrow, all on
the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. As a result of the Merger,
the Company will conduct its business and operations as a wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent. The transactions described in this Agreement are subject
to the termination or expiration of the waiting period required under the HSR
Act and the satisfaction of other conditions described in this Agreement.

         This Agreement and the Merger must be approved by the affirmative vote
of holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the Company's
Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class
(the "Requisite Vote"), which vote will occur on the date hereof by means of a
written consent in accordance with Section 228 of the DGCL with notice to all
other Stockholders to be sent to such other Stockholders in accordance with such
Section as described in Sections 3.4 and 8.8 hereof. In addition, on the date of
this Agreement each Owner who has executed a counterpart signature to this
Agreement and who owns Company Capital Stock will execute in their capacity as a
Stockholder a written consent approving the terms of this Agreement and the
Merger.

         Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Article
13 below.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the above and the mutual
warranties, representations, covenants, and agreements set forth herein, the
parties agree as follows:

         3.2      Conversion of Shares. Subject to the provisions of this
Article 3, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, the Company, Merger Corp. or the stockholders of any of
the foregoing, the capital stock and rights thereto of the constituent
corporations shall be converted as follows:

         (a) Each share of Merger Corp. Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall
be converted into one (1) share of Common Stock of the Surviving Corporation.

         (b) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time (other than treasury shares and, if applicable, any Dissenting Shares)
shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into and exchanged for the
right to receive from Parent the Cash Payment Per Share. In addition, each
holder of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive its Common Stock Ownership
Percentage of the Escrow Amount, which will be released pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

         (c) Each share of Series A Preferred (other than treasury shares and,
if applicable, any Dissenting Shares) issued and outstanding at the Effective
Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into the right to
receive from Parent the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Cash Payment Per

Series A Preferred is convertible immediately prior to the Effective Time. In
addition, each holder of Series A Preferred shall be entitled to receive its
Series A Ownership Percentage of the Escrow Amount, which will be released
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

         (d) Each share of Series B Preferred (other than treasury shares and,

Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall be converted into the right to
receive from Parent the product obtained by multiplying (i) the Cash Payment Per
Share, and (ii) the number of shares of Common Stock the holder of such Series B
Preferred is entitled to receive as of the Effective Time assuming that each
share of Series A Preferred issuable upon conversion of such Series B Preferred
is converted into Common Stock. In addition, each holder of Series B Preferred
shall be entitled to receive its Series B Ownership Percentage of the Escrow
Amount, which will be released to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

                                        3

<PAGE>

         (e) Each Common Stock Warrant that is issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time shall represent the right to receive from Parent a cash payment
(subject to applicable tax withholding, if any) equal to (i) the product
obtained by multiplying (a) the number of shares of Common Stock the holder of
such Common Stock Warrant is entitled to receive upon exercise of such Common
Stock Warrant as of the Effective Time, by (b) the Cash Payment Per Share, minus
(ii) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the exercise price per share of
such Common Stock Warrant, by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock the
holder of such Common Stock Warrant is entitled to receive upon exercise of such
Common Stock Warrant as of the Effective Time (the "Common Stock Warrant
Payment"). At the Effective Time, each Common Stock Warrant shall no longer
represent the right to purchase shares of Common Stock, but in lieu thereof
shall represent the nontransferable right to receive the Common Stock Warrant
Payment. In addition, each holder of a Common Stock Warrant shall be entitled to
receive its Common Stock Warrant Ownership Percentage of the Escrow Amount,
which will be released pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

         (f) Each Preferred Warrant that is issued and outstanding at the
Effective Time shall represent the right to receive from Parent a cash payment
(subject to applicable tax withholding) equal to (i) the product obtained by
multiplying (a) the number of shares of Common Stock the holder of such
Preferred Warrant is entitled to receive as of the Effective Time assuming that
each share of Series A Preferred issuable upon exercise of such Preferred
Warrant is converted into Common Stock as of the Effective Time, by (b) the Cash
Payment Per Share, minus (ii) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the
exercise price per share of such Preferred Warrant, by (y) the number of shares
of Common Stock the holder of such Preferred Warrant is entitled to receive as
of the Effective Time assuming that each share of Series A Preferred issuable
upon exercise of such Preferred Warrant is converted into Common Stock as of the
Effective Time (the "Preferred Warrant Payment"). At the Effective Time, each
Preferred Warrant shall no longer represent the right to purchase shares of
Series A Preferred, but in lieu thereof shall represent the nontransferable
right to receive the Preferred Warrant Payment. In addition, each holder of a
Preferred Warrant shall be entitled to receive its Preferred Warrant Ownership
Percentage of the Escrow Amount, which will be released pursuant to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement.

         (g) Each Option that is issued and outstanding at the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for the right to receive from Parent a
cash payment (subject to applicable tax withholding) equal to (i) the product
obtained by multiplying (a) the number of shares of Common Stock the holder of
such Option would have been entitled to receive upon exercise of the vested
portion of such Option as of the Effective Time assuming that each share of
Series A Preferred issuable upon exercise of such Option is converted into
Common Stock as of the Effective Time, by (b) the Cash Payment Per Share, minus
(ii) the product obtained by multiplying (x) the exercise price per share of
such Option, by (y) the number of shares of Common Stock the holder of such
Option is entitled to receive upon the exercise of the vested portion of such
Option as of the Effective Time assuming that each share of Series A Preferred
issuable upon exercise of such Option is converted into Common Stock as of the
Effective Time (the "Option Payment"). At the Effective Time, the unvested
portion of each Option shall be canceled without consideration and shall no
longer represent the right to purchase shares of Series A Preferred. At the
Effective Time the vested portion of each Option shall be canceled and shall no
longer represent the right to purchase shares of Series A Preferred, but in lieu

                                       4

<PAGE>

thereof shall represent the nontransferable right to receive the Option Payment.
In addition, each holder of an Option shall be entitled to receive its Option
Holder Ownership Percentage of the Escrow Amount, which will be released
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

         3.3      Treasury Shares Held by Company Entities. Each share of
Company Capital Stock held by any of the Company Entities shall be canceled and
retired at the Effective Time and no consideration shall be issued in exchange
therefor.

         3.4      Dissenting Stockholders. Each Owner waives notice of and
agrees not to seek or assert any dissenter's or appraisal rights, or any similar
rights, to which such Owner would otherwise be entitled. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but only in the circumstances and to
the extent provided by the DGCL, shares of Company Capital Stock that are
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by Persons
who are not Owners and who did not vote such shares in favor of the Merger or
consent to the Merger in writing and who shall have properly and timely
delivered to the Company, as the case may be, a written demand for appraisal of
their shares of the Company Capital Stock in accordance with Section 262 of the
DGCL ("Dissenting Shares") shall not be converted into the right to receive, or
be exchangeable for, the Merger Consideration, the contingent right to receive a
proportionate percentage of the Escrow Amount. Instead, the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL. The Company shall
give Parent (i) prompt notice of all demands for payment under Section 262 of
the DGCL, and (ii) the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands for payment under Section 262 of the DGCL. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of
Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any
demands for payment under Section 262 of the DGCL, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. If a holder of Company Capital Stock demands appraisal of the fair
value of shares of Company Capital Stock under Section 262 of the DGCL after
Closing and such shares become Dissenting Shares, the Owners' Representative
shall instruct the Paying Agent to return to Parent any portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration previously deposited with respect to such Dissenting Shares
and the Paying Agent will return such portion to Parent.

         3.5      Reserve. The Owners' Representative may elect, by delivery of
written notice to Parent not later than one (1) business day prior to the
Closing Date, to establish a reserve in such amount as the Owners'
Representative may in its sole discretion determine to be appropriate (the
"Reserve"), to be applied as set forth below in this Section 3.5, and, in the
event of such an election, a portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
otherwise deliverable at or after the Effective Time to Stockholders, which
portion shall be equal to the amount so specified by the Owners' Representative
in such written notice, shall be delivered at the Effective Time to the Owners'
Representative or a third-party designee of the Owners' Representative by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to be held as a reserve by the Owners'
Representative or a third-party designee of the Owners' Representative on behalf
of the Stockholders for up to eighteen (18)_months after the Effective Time, or
for such shorter time as the Owners' Representative may determine in its sole
discretion. The funds so held (and earnings thereon) may be applied as the
Owners' Representative in its sole discretion determines appropriate to defray,
offset, settle or pay any post-Closing Date charges, fees, costs, liabilities or
expenses of the Company and/or the Stockholders incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or

                                       5

<PAGE>

the Escrow Agreement and not otherwise provided for herein or therein,
including, without limitation, any obligations of the Stockholders in respect of
the matters referred to in Article 12. The balance of the Reserve held pursuant
to this Section 3.5, if any, and any income earned thereon, shall be distributed
to the Stockholders who are entitled to receive the Aggregate Merger
Consideration hereunder, pro rata according to their interests, promptly after
the Owners' Representative has determined, in its sole discretion, such
distribution to be appropriate. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall have
no liability or responsibility to the Stockholders with respect to the Reserve
or the actions and responsibilities of the Owners' Representative contemplated
by this Section 3.5.

                                    ARTICLE 4
                         PAYMENT OF MERGER CONSIDERATION

         4.1      Escrow Account. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit in
an escrow account (the "Escrow Account") with The Bank of New York, as escrow
agent (the "Escrow Agent"), an amount of cash equal to Two Million Dollars
($2,000,000) (the "Escrow Amount"). The Escrow Account shall be held, invested
and disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1 (the "Escrow
Agreement").

         4.2      Payment Procedures.

         (a) At the Effective Time, Parent shall wire in immediately available
funds to each Stockholder that has surrendered its certificate or certificates
representing shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the "Certificates") or an appropriate affidavit of loss regarding loss of
such Certificate or Certificates and an indemnification for loss in favor of
Parent, the Cash Payment Per Share payable to such Stockholder for each share of
Company Capital Stock represented by the surrendered Certificates (or covered by
such affidavit of loss and indemnity). Any Certificates so surrendered shall be
endorsed for transfer or accompanied by stock powers in favor of Parent and
shall be free and clear of any and all Liens.

         (b) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall designate a bank or
trust company (the "Paying Agent") reasonably acceptable to the Company to make
the payments of the funds to which holders of Company Equity Securities shall
become entitled pursuant to Article 3. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit with
the Paying Agent in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Equity
Securities immediately available funds in an amount not less than the amount
necessary to make the payments for Company Equity Securities contemplated by
Article 3 (less any amounts paid pursuant to Section 4.2(a)). Such funds shall
be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation. Failure of the Paying Agent to make any required payment to holders
in accordance with Article 3, shall not release Parent of liability therefor;
provided that if Parent makes a payment otherwise required to be made by the
Paying Agent, then the portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration held by the
Paying Agent that is attributable to such payment shall be returned to Parent.

         (c) Promptly (and in no event more than ten (10) calendar days) after
the Effective Time, Parent shall (or shall cause the Paying Agent to) mail to
each holder of record of a Certificate the appropriate transmittal materials and
instructions (which shall specify that delivery shall be

                                        6

<PAGE>

effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate(s) shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of such Certificate(s), to the Paying Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify and
that are reasonably acceptable to the Company). After the Effective Time, each
holder of Company Capital Stock shall surrender the Certificate(s) representing
shares of Company Capital Stock owned by such Person (and not previously
delivered at the Closing) to the Paying Agent. Upon surrender of Certificate(s)
(or an affidavit of loss as provided below), together with a transmittal letter,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be requested by the
Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall deliver to such holder of Company Capital
Stock the Merger Consideration owed for each share represented by the
Certificate(s) or affidavit of loss surrendered; provided that each Certificate
and each share represented by an affidavit of loss must be free and clear of any
and all Liens. The Paying Agent shall not be obligated to deliver the
consideration to which any former holder of Company Capital Stock is entitled as
a result of the Merger until such Person surrenders his, her or its
Certificate(s) representing the shares of Company Capital Stock for exchange as
provided in this Article 4 or such Person provides an appropriate affidavit
regarding loss of such Certificate(s) and an indemnification for loss in favor
of Parent (as described below in this Section 4.2). The Certificate(s)
representing Company Capital Stock so delivered shall be duly endorsed for
transfer or accompanied by stock powers in favor of Parent. If there has been a
transfer of ownership of shares of Company Capital Stock represented by
Certificate(s) that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
then the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate(s) representing such shares are delivered to the Paying Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence such transfer and by evidence
satisfactory to the Paying Agent that any applicable stock transfer taxes have
been paid. If any Certificate(s) shall have been lost, stolen, mislaid or
destroyed, upon receipt of (i) an affidavit of that fact from the holder
claiming such Certificate(s) to be lost, mislaid, stolen or destroyed, and (ii)
such indemnity as the Paying Agent may reasonably require, then the Paying Agent
shall promptly deliver to such holder the consideration into which the shares
represented by such lost, stolen, mislaid or destroyed Certificate(s) shall have
been converted.

         (d) Promptly (and in no event more than ten (10) calendar days after
the Effective Time), Paying Agent shall mail, or cause to be mailed, to each
holder of Options, Preferred Warrants or Common Stock Warrants as of the
Effective Time notice that the Merger has been consummated and instructions for
effecting the cancellation or termination, to the extent necessary, of such
Options, Preferred Warrants, and Common Stock Warrants (and the surrender of any
certificates representing any such Options, Common Stock Warrants or Preferred
Warrants for cancellation or termination) and obtaining the payment of the
Merger Consideration, which notice and instructions shall be in such form and
have such other provisions as Paying Agent may reasonably specify, and that are
reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time. Upon delivery
by such holder to Paying Agent of such documents as may be reasonably requested
by Paying Agent and that are reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent to
effectuate the payment contemplated by this Section 4.2, Paying Agent shall
promptly deliver the amount to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this
Section 4.2. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, payment shall, in Parent's or Paying Agent's discretion, be withheld
for any Option, Preferred Warrant or Common Stock Warrant until all necessary
consents in respect of such Option, Preferred Warrant or Common Stock Warrant
are obtained.

                                       7

<PAGE>

         (e) Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Paying Agent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Capital Stock,
Options, Preferred Warrants or Common Stock Warrants such amounts, if any, as it
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent that any amounts are so withheld by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
Paying Agent, as the case may be, and promptly paid over to the applicable
Regulatory Authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company
Capital Stock, Options, Preferred Warrants or Common Stock Warrants in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Paying Agent, as the case may be.

         (f) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, neither
Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor Paying Agent shall be liable to a holder
of Company Capital Stock, Options, Preferred Warrants or Common Stock Warrants
for any amounts paid or property delivered in good faith to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

         4.3      Rights of Former Company Stockholders. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed as to holders of Company
Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time and no transfer of Company
Capital Stock by any such holder shall thereafter be made or recognized. Until
surrendered for exchange in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.2, each
Certificate theretofore representing shares of Company Capital Stock, excluding
Dissenting Shares and treasury shares, shall from and after the Effective Time
represent for all purposes only the right to receive the consideration provided
in Section 3.2 without interest.

                                    ARTICLE 5
                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

of the State of Delaware with full power and authority to execute and deliver

thereunder. The Company has full power and authority necessary to own and
operate its properties and to carry on its business as now conducted. Except as
set forth on Schedule 5.1, the Company is duly qualified to do business and is
in good standing in the State of Tennessee, which is the only jurisdiction in
which a failure to be so qualified or in good standing would be reasonably
likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

         5.2      Authorization of Transactions.

         (a) The Company has the corporate power and authority necessary to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which

applicable law. The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, as well as the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated herein and therein, including the
Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action
in respect thereof on the part of the Company, subject, in the case of the
Merger, to the Requisite Vote. The Company has duly executed and delivered this
Agreement, and, subject, in the case of the Merger, to the Requisite Vote, this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party,
assuming this Agreement and the Transaction Documents constitute the valid and
binding agreement of the other parties hereto and thereto represent, or upon
execution and delivery will represent, legal, valid and binding obligations of
the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms,
except that the enforcement hereof and thereof may be limited by (i) applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or
other similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to creditors' rights
generally and (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforceability is considered in a proceeding at law or in equity).

         (b) The Board of Directors of the Company, at a meeting duly called and
held, duly adopted resolutions (i) approving and adopting this Agreement, the
other Transaction Documents to which the Company is a party, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, (ii) determining that the
terms of the Merger are fair and in the best interests of the Company and the
Stockholders and that the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the other Transaction Documents are in the best interests of the Company and the

condition, and the results of operations and cash flows of the Company Entities
for such periods and at such dates (collectively, the "Financial Statements").

Statements or otherwise known to management and (B) contain no deficiencies in
the design or operation of such controls and procedures that could materially
adversely affect the ability of the Company Entities to record, process,
summarize and report financial and other relevant information.

infringement. All material licenses for Intellectual Property are in full force
and effect, and there exists no breach or violation of or default under any of
such licenses by the Company Entities or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other party to any such licenses or any event which, with or without notice or

thereunder by the Company Entities or, to the Knowledge of the Company, any
other party to any such licenses.

         (b) The Company Entities are not currently in receipt of any written
notice of any violation or infringement of, and have no Knowledge that the

Entities under, or require the Consent of any other party to, any of the Company

         5.16     Employee Benefit Matters.

         (a) The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of
this Agreement copies of all pension, retirement, profit-sharing, life
insurance, medical, hospitalization, vacation, disability, dental, or vision
plans, any written or unwritten incentive compensation, fringe benefit, payroll
or employment practice, bonus, option, stock purchase, severance, sick pay,
salary continuation, deferred compensation, supplemental executive compensation,
employment agreements and consulting agreements, including "employee benefit
plans" as that term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, adopted, maintained by,
sponsored in whole or in part by, or contributed to within the last six (6)
years at any time by any of the Company Entities or any of their ERISA
Affiliates for the benefit of employees of any of the Company Entities or
retirees, their dependents or spouses, and directors, independent contractors,
or other beneficiaries (collectively, the "Benefit Plans"). Any Benefit Plan
that is an "employee pension benefit plan," as that term is defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA, or an "employee welfare benefit plan," as that term is defined in
Section 3(1) of ERISA, is referred to herein as an "ERISA Plan." Each ERISA Plan
that is also a "defined benefit plan" (as defined in Code Section 414(j)) is
referred to herein as a "Pension Plan."

         (b) For each Benefit Plan, the Company has delivered or made available
to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all (i) trust agreements or other
funding arrangements for such Benefit Plan (including insurance contracts) and
all amendments thereto; (ii) determination letters (including determination
letters for each prior version of such Benefit Plan and each plan that has been
merged into such Benefit Plan), and material rulings, opinion letters,
information letters or advisory opinions issued by the IRS, the Department of
Labor or the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation; (iii) the three (3) most
recent annual reports or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements,
actuarial valuations and reports, and summary annual reports prepared for any
Benefit Plan; (iv) summary plan descriptions and any material modifications
thereto; (v) copies of any filings with the IRS; (vi) all personnel, payroll and
employment manuals and policies; (vii) all collective bargaining agreements to
which any Company Entity is a party; and (viii) all contracts with third-party
administrators, actuaries, investment managers, consultants and other
independent contractors that relate to Benefit Plans.

         (c) All Benefit Plans are in material compliance with the applicable
terms of ERISA, the Code, and any other applicable Laws. Each ERISA Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS, and neither any of the Company Entities nor
any ERISA Affiliate is aware of any circumstances likely to result in revocation
of any such favorable determination letter. All plan documents, annual reports
or returns, audited or unaudited financial statements, actuarial valuations,
summary annual reports and summary plan descriptions issued with respect to all
ERISA Plans have been timely filed with the IRS or the Department of Labor, or
distributed to participants, as required by law.

         (d) No Pension Plan is or has been, and neither any of the Company
Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate has withdrawn from, a multiemployer plan within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA. Except as disclosed in Schedule 5.16(d),
neither the Company Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate has any liability to the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any Pension Plan. No
Pension Plan that is subject to the minimum funding standards of Code Section
412 has an "accumulated funding deficiency" as defined in Code Section 412 and

                                       17

<PAGE>

Section 302 of ERISA, whether or not waived. No Pension Plan has any "unfunded
current liability," as that term is defined in Section 302(d)(8)(A) of ERISA or
a "liquidity shortfall," as defined in Code 412, and the fair market value of
the assets of any such plan exceeds the present value of all benefits (whether
vested or not) accrued to date by all present and former participants in such
Pension Plan determined on a plan termination basis. No lien exists or can be
expected to exist under Code Section 412(n) or ERISA 302(f), and no tax has been
imposed or can be expected to be imposed under Code Section 4971, with respect
to any Pension Plan. Neither any of the Company Entities nor any ERISA Affiliate
has provided, or is required to provide, security to any Pension Plan pursuant
to Code Section 401(a)(29).

         (e) Since the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, there has
been (i) no material change in the financial position of any Pension Plan, (ii)
no change in the actuarial assumptions with respect to any Pension Plan, and
(iii) no increase in benefits under any Pension Plan as a result of plan

Parent audited consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31,
2003 and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders' equity and

         8.3      Antitrust Notification; Consents of Regulatory Authorities.
To the extent required by the HSR Act, each of the Parent and the Company shall,
within five (5) business days of the date hereof, file with the United States
Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") and the United States Department of Justice
("DOJ") the notification and report form required for the transactions
contemplated hereby, shall promptly file any supplemental or additional
information which may reasonably be requested in connection therewith pursuant
to the HSR Act, and shall comply in all material respects with the requirements
of the HSR Act. Each Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve
objections, if any, which may be asserted with respect to the Merger under the
HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the Federal
Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other federal, state or foreign Law or
regulation or decree designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions for the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade (collectively
"Antitrust Laws"). In the event any Litigation is threatened or instituted
challenging the Merger as violative of Antitrust Laws, each party shall use its
reasonable best efforts to avoid the filing of, or to resist or resolve, such
Litigation. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such action
as may be required by: (i) the DOJ and/or the FTC in order to resolve such
objections as either of them may have to the Merger under the Antitrust Laws, or
(ii) any federal or state court of the United States, or similar court of
competent jurisdiction in any foreign jurisdiction, in any suit brought by any
Regulatory Authority or any other Person challenging the Merger as violative of
the Antitrust Laws, in order to avoid the entry of any Order (whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent) which has the effect of preventing the consummation of
the Merger and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any such Order.
For purposes of this Article 8.3, reasonable best efforts shall not include the
willingness of Parent or Merger Corp. to take an action that would result in a
Company Material Adverse Effect assuming that in the event of a divestiture, or
the holding separate of any assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries, the Company
Entities own any assets being divested or held separate. Parent and Merger Corp.
shall be entitled to direct any proceedings or negotiations with any Regulatory
Authority relating to any of the foregoing, provided that it shall afford the
Company a reasonable opportunity to participate therein.

         (b) Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use
their reasonable efforts to promptly prepare and file all necessary
documentation, to effect all applications, notices, petitions and filings (which
shall include the filings pursuant to subsection (a) above), and to obtain as
promptly as practicable all Consents of all Regulatory Authorities and other
Persons that are necessary or advisable to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent and the Company agree that
they shall consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all Consents
of all Regulatory Authorities and other Persons necessary or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,

                                       33

<PAGE>

and each of them shall keep the other apprised of the status of matters relating
to consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each party
also shall promptly advise the other upon receiving any communication from any
Regulatory Authority or other Person whose Consent is a condition to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement which causes
such party to believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that such Consent
shall not be obtained or that the receipt of any such Consent will be materially
delayed.

         8.4      Agreement as to Efforts to Consummate.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent, the Company and the Owners agrees to use, and to cause its Subsidiaries
to use, its reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper, or advisable under
applicable Laws to consummate and make effective, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including using its reasonable best efforts to lift or rescind
any Order adversely affecting its ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein and to cause to be satisfied the conditions referred to in
Article 10; provided, that nothing herein shall preclude any party from
exercising its rights under this Agreement.

         (b) If requested by Parent, the Company agrees to cooperate reasonably
with Parent or Merger Corp. in connection with the arrangement of, and the
negotiation of agreements with respect to, the financing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the
Company, nor any of its Affiliates, officers, directors, representatives,
employees or agents shall be required to incur any liability or obligation in
connection therewith. Further, Parent agrees and acknowledges that, should the
Closing fail to occur, Parent shall promptly reimburse the Company for any costs
and/or expenses any Company Entity may have incurred in connection with the
cooperation contemplated in this Section 8.4(b). As part of the Company's
obligations under this Section 8.4(b), the Company agrees to take all required
action to ensure that the Company is qualified to do business and is in good
standing in the State of Tennessee. Further, the Company agrees to provide
reasonable assistance to Parent in obtaining certificates of good standing or
foreign qualification certificates, if applicable, for each Company Entity from
the Secretary of State of each state where it is qualified to transact business.

         (c) From and after the date hereof, the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with and assist Parent with developing and executing an appropriate
transition and communications plan in order to assure an orderly transition
following Closing, including, but not limited to, using reasonable efforts to
provide reasonable access to: (i) officers, employees, medical directors,
consultants, attorneys, accountants, members of joint ventures (or their
representatives), managed company owners, vendors and independent contractors of
the Company Entities; (ii) offices, dialysis centers, laboratories and other
facilities owned or operated by the Company Entities; and (iii) books, records,
reports, and files of the Company Entities. From and after the date hereof, the

required to be filed with any applicable Regulatory Authority as a result of the
Merger.

Stockholder to become an Owner by executing a counterpart signature page to this
Agreement on or before the Effective Time.

affirm and ratify the terms of that certain confidentiality agreement, dated
December 3, 2003, among them concerning confidentiality, public announcements
and related matters, which agreement remains valid and binding among the parties
notwithstanding Section 14.8 hereof. Parent and the Company will consult with
each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review,
comment upon and concur with, and use reasonable efforts to agree on, any press
release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the Merger, and shall not issue any such press
release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as
either party may determine is required by applicable Law, court process or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities
exchange or stock market. The parties agree that the initial press release to be

notify the other parties hereto orally and in writing to the extent he, she or
it has Knowledge of (i) any representation or warranty made by him, her or it in
this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate, (ii) the failure by him, her or it
to comply in any material respect with or satisfy in any material respect any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by him, her or
it under this Agreement, and (iii) any change or event having, or that could
reasonably and foreseeably be expected to have, a material adverse effect on
such party or on the truth of such party's representations and warranties or the
ability of the conditions set forth herein to be satisfied; provided, however,
that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

         8.8      Notice of Appraisal Rights and Stockholder Action by Written

         (a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and
former directors, officers, employees and agents of the Company Entities, and
the heirs, executors and administrators of such persons (each a "Company
Indemnified Party") in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or prior to the
Effective Time or arising out of or pertaining to any Person having been an
officer, director, employee or agent of any Company Entity (or any other Person
at the request of a Company Entity) or pertaining to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to the full extent provided under the Company's
certificate of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date hereof (including
the payment of expenses in advance of the disposition of any action with respect
to such matters as provided therein). Parent and Surviving Corporation shall not
amend the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to

directors' liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring on or
prior to the Effective Time covering each such person currently covered by the
Company's officers' and directors' liability insurance policy on terms
substantially similar to those of such policy in effect on the date hereof and
from an insurer or insurers having claims paying ratings no lower than the
Company's current insurer. The Company acknowledges and agrees that Parent may
satisfy the requirements of this Section 8.9(b) by securing an endorsement of
the Company's officers' and directors' liability policy in effect on the date

the date of this Agreement by the Company (the "Maximum Amount"). If the amount
of the premiums necessary to maintain or procure such insurance coverage exceeds
the Maximum Amount, the Surviving Corporation shall use its reasonable efforts
to maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' liability
insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount.

         (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so
that such successors and assigns assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 8.9.

such matter (i) represents a failure of any representation or warranty contained
in any Transaction Document to be true and correct when made or deemed made or
(ii) represents a breach of any warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company

         (a) the breach by Parent or Merger Corp. of any representation or
warranty contained herein or in any document or instrument delivered by Parent
or Merger Corp. in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, or the failure of any such representation or warranty to be true and
correct when made or deemed made; or

         (b) the breach or non-fulfillment of any covenant or agreement of

this Article 12 (the "Indemnified Party") shall promptly give written notice to
the indemnifying party (the "Indemnifying Party") of any matter giving rise to
an obligation to indemnify. The Indemnifying Party may assume the defense of

                                       45

<PAGE>

indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim. Should the
Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense, the Indemnifying Party shall
not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense of such claim.
If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense it shall conduct the defense
diligently with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the Indemnifying Party may not settle
any such claim without the consent of the Indemnified Party, unless such
settlement provides for only monetary relief that is paid in full or on behalf
of the Indemnifying Party and includes a full and unconditional release of the
Indemnified Parties; provided that to the extent of the Indemnified Party is
required such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. If the Owners or the
Stockholders are the Indemnifying Party, then the notice required by the
immediately preceding sentence shall be given to the Owners' Representative who
shall act on behalf of the Indemnifying Party for purposes of this Article 12.
The Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and to
make reasonably available to the Indemnifying Party any necessary records or
documents in the possession of the Indemnified Party, which are necessary to
defend such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not defend or settle such
claim, the Indemnified Party may do so without the Indemnifying Party's
participation, in which case the Indemnifying Party shall pay the expenses of
such defense, and the Indemnified Party may settle or compromise such claim
without the Indemnifying Party's consent. The failure of any Indemnified Party
to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of
its obligations hereunder except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
actually prejudiced by such failure to give notice. With respect to any matter
for which indemnification is or may be sought by the Parent Indemnified Parties
pursuant to Section 12.2(d) (solely with respect to claims relating to that
certain letter dated December 23, 2003 to NNA of Alabama, Inc. from Blue Cross
Blue Shield of Alabama) or 12.2(e), the parties agree that (i) the Stockholders,
through the Owners' Representative, shall be entitled to control the
negotiations, discussions and any other communications relating to such matter,
(ii) neither Parent nor the Company Entities shall enter into any contract,
agreement or other arrangement which could reasonably be expected to result in
any liability under Section 12.2(d) (solely with respect to claims relating to
that certain letter dated December 23, 2003 to NNA of Alabama, Inc. from Blue
Cross Blue Shield of Alabama) or 12.2(e) to the Stockholders, without the
Owners' Representative's prior written consent, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld; (iii) Owners' Representative shall keep Parent
Indemnified Parties reasonably informed regarding the status of any such matters
and shall provide Parent Indemnified Parties with copies of all correspondence
relating thereto; (iv) the Stockholders and the Owners' Representative agree
that they are on notice of the matters referenced in Schedules 12.2(d) (solely
with respect to claims relating to that certain letter dated December 23, 2003
to NNA of Alabama, Inc. from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama) and 12.2(e)
hereto and that the Stockholders, through the Owners' Representative, have
agreed to assume the defense thereof.

for indemnification under Section 12.2(d) as to any Stockholder shall not exceed

the parties contained in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents

12 shall be the sole and exclusive remedy after the Closing Date for damages
available to the parties to this Agreement for breach of any of the terms,
conditions, representations or warranties contained herein or any Transaction
Document or any right, claim or action arising from the transactions

         14.2     Owners' Representative.

         (a) The Owners and the Company hereby irrevocably make, constitute and
appoint J.W. Childs Equity Partners II, L.P. as their agent and attorney-in-fact
(the "Owners' Representative") and authorize and empower it to fulfill the role
of Owners' Representative hereunder. As to the Stockholders who are not Owners,
the Company has joined this Section 14.2 to authorize the Owners' Representative
to act in a ministerial and administrative capacity for such Stockholders under
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. In the event of the resignation of an
Owners' Representative, the resigning Owners' Representative shall appoint a
successor from among the Owners, which successor must agree in writing to accept
such appointment. If an Owners' Representative should die or become
incapacitated, his or her successor shall be appointed within fifteen (15) days
of his or her death or incapacity by the remaining Owners' Representative if
there is one or by the Owners if there is not a remaining Owners'
Representative, and any such successor shall be an Owner or an officer of an
Owner and shall agree in writing to accept such appointment. Such appointments
will be made by Owners holding (or after the Closing, formerly holding) a
majority of the outstanding Company Capital Stock. The choice of a successor
Owners' Representative appointed in any manner permitted above shall be final
and binding upon all of the Owners. The decisions and actions of any successor
Owners' Representative shall be, for all purposes, those of an Owners'
Representative as if originally named herein.

         (b) Each Owner has made, constituted and appointed and by the execution
of this Agreement hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints each
Owners' Representative acting alone as such person's true and lawful
attorney-in-fact and agent, for such person and in such person's name, place and
stead for all purposes necessary or desirable in order for the Owners'
Representative to take the actions contemplated by the Transaction Documents on
behalf of the Owners, with the ability to execute and deliver all instruments,
certificates and other documents of every kind incident to the foregoing to all
intents and purposes and with the same effect as such Owner could do personally,
and each Owner hereby ratifies and confirms as his, her or its own act, all that
the Owners' Representative shall do or cause to be done pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 14.2. All notices under Section 14.1 and all other
notices and communications directed to Owners under this Agreement shall be
given to Owners' Representative.

         (c) The death or incapacity of any Owner shall not terminate the
authority and agency of the Owners' Representative.

         (d) The Owners' Representative shall not be responsible for any loss
suffered by, or liability of any kind to, the Owners arising out of any act done
or omitted by the Owners'

                                       58

<PAGE>

Representative in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Owners' Representative's duties hereunder, unless such act or omission involves
bad faith. The Owners hereby agree to indemnify the Owners' Representative and
to hold him or her harmless against any and all loss, liability or expense
incurred without bad faith on the part of the Owners' Representative and arising
out of or in connection with his or her duties as Owners' Representative,
including the reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Owners'
Representative in defending against any claim or liability in connection
herewith.

         14.3     Further Assurances. Each party covenants that at any time, and
from time to time, after the Closing, it will execute such additional
instruments and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the other
parties to confirm or perfect or otherwise to carry out the intent and purposes
of this Agreement.

         14.4     Waiver.

         (a) Parent, acting through its chief executive officer or other
authorized officer, shall at any time have the right to waive any default in the
performance of any term of this Agreement by the Company, to waive or extend the
time for the compliance or fulfillment by the Company of any and all of its
obligations under this Agreement, and to waive any or all of the conditions
precedent to the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, except any
condition which, if not satisfied, would result in the violation of any Law. No
such waiver shall be effective unless in writing signed by a duly authorized
officer of Parent.

         (b) Prior to or at the Effective Time, the Company, acting through its
chief executive officer or other authorized officer, shall have the right to
waive any default in the performance of any term of this Agreement by Parent or
Merger Corp., to waive or extend the time for the compliance or fulfillment by
Parent or Merger Corp. of any and all of its obligations under this Agreement,
and to waive any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the
Company under this Agreement, except any condition which, if not satisfied,

waiver or extension on behalf of any Owner may be made by the Owners'
Representative. No such waiver shall be effective unless in writing signed by a
duly authorized officer of the Company or Owners' Representative, as applicable.

         (c) The failure of any party at any time or times to require
performance of any provision hereof shall in no manner affect the right of such
party at a later time to enforce the same or any other provision of this
Agreement. No waiver of any condition or of the breach of any term contained in
this Agreement in one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a
further or continuing waiver of such condition or breach or a waiver of any
other condition or of the breach of any other term of this Agreement.

Agreement without the consent of the Company to any direct or indirect
Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent or Merger Corp. or to any party that acquires
substantially all of the assets or stock of Parent or Merger Corp. or any
successor entity resulting from a merger or consolidation

                                       59

shall not relieve Parent of any obligation hereunder.

to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legal
representatives, executors, administrators, successors and assigns. This

Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an agreement in writing
signed by the party against whom or which the enforcement of such change,
waiver, discharge or termination is sought.

by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State Delaware, without
regard to any applicable conflicts of Laws. The provisions of this Agreement are
severable and the invalidity of one or more of the provisions herein shall not
have any effect upon the validity or enforceability of any other provision. As
to any dispute, claim, or litigation arising out of or relating in any way to
this Agreement or the transaction at issue in this Agreement, the parties hereto
hereby agree and consent to be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Delaware Chancery Court. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, (a) any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to laying venue of any suit, action or proceeding brought in such court,
(b) any claim that any suit, action or proceeding brought in such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum, and (c) any defense that it may now or
hereafter have based on lack of personal jurisdiction in such forum.

         14.10    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
