Affiliates not to, acquire or agree to acquire (directly or indirectly and
whether by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise) any business, any

borne by the Purchasers.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

     4.2.5  |   | In furtherance of the foregoing, the Purchasers shall

contrary, the Purchasers shall not be obliged to take any step which would be
materially to the detriment of the CBandI Group or the Acquired Group (in

by the Sellers in connection with the termination of this Agreement.  
      
  4.3.4  |   | The Sellers undertake to provide to CBandI, in a timely

or assistance provided by the Sellers in accordance with this Clause 4.3.4.

which this Agreement (other than the Surviving Provisions) shall terminate.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Clause 4.5.1 shall not be available to any Party whose failure to
perform any of its obligations under this Agreement has been the cause of,
or resulted in, the failure of Completion to occur on or before the Long-Stop
Date.  
      
  4.5.2  |   | In the event that this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Clause 4.5.1, neither Party shall have any claim under this
Agreement of any nature whatsoever against the other Party (except in respect

Provisions).  
      
  5.  |   | TERMINATION RIGHT  
      
  5.1  |   | If at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to
Completion the Purchasers (or either of them) become aware of any breach(es)

the Purchasers (or either of them) would have been entitled to recover
from the Sellers, by way of damages for breach of the Sellers Warranties
and/or Clause 6.2 (as applicable), an amount in excess of fifty million
dollars ($50,000,000) (ignoring for this purpose the effect of paragraph 3.1
of Schedule 7 ( _The Sellers  Limitations of Liability_)), then the
Purchasers may, by notice in writing to the Sellers, inform the Sellers of
such breach(es), specifying in reasonable detail the alleged breach(es),
including the amount(s) of the claim(s) arising from such breach(es).  
      
  5.2  |   | Upon receipt of notice in accordance with Clause 5.1, the
Sellers shall have fifteen (15) Business Days to rectify the breach(es)
specified in such notice. If the Sellers fail to rectify such breach(es) to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Purchasers within such period, or if
rectification of a breach is not possible, then the Sellers may, in their
sole discretion, elect:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | in the case of each claim for breach of Clause
6.2 specified in such notice, to waive the provisions of paragraph 3.1 of
Schedule 7 ( _The Sellers  Limitations of Liability_) such that such
paragraph 3.1 shall be read as if to exclude such claim from the fifty
million dollar ($50,000,000) limitation of liability referred to therein;
and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | in the case of claims for breach of any of the Sellers
Warranties specified in such notice:  
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (i)  |   | if the aggregate amount of all such claims,
when substantiated, equals or exceeds forty million dollars ($40,000,000),
that the maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers set out in paragraph 3.1
of Schedule 7 (The Sellers Limitations of Liability) shall be equal to
the aggregate amount of all such claims when substantiated plus ten
million dollars ($10,000,000); or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (ii)  |   | if the aggregate amount of all such claims,
when substantiated, is less than forty million dollars ($40,000,000), that
the maximum aggregate liability of the Sellers set out in paragraph 3.1
of Schedule 7 ( _The Sellers  Limitations of Liability_) shall be fifty
million dollars ($50,000,000),  
   

  

       |   | _provided_ that, for the avoidance of doubt, any such
election must be made in respect of all claims notified under Clause 5.1, and
not just some only.  
---|---|--- 
      
  5.3  |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchasers shall be permitted
to update any notice served under Clause 5.1 to include details of any
further breach(es) of the Sellers Warranties and/or by the Sellers of their
obligations under Clause 6.2, and the provisions of Clause 5.2 shall apply in
relation to the original (or previously updated) notice as so updated,
save that the fifteen (15) days shall run from the date of the updated
notice, rather than from the date of the original (or previously updated)
notice.  
      
  5.4  |   | If the Sellers do not make an election in accordance with
Clause 5.2 within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt of notice in
accordance with Clause 5.1, the Purchasers shall not be obliged to complete
the purchase of the Shares, and shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement by giving notice in writing to the Sellers by not later than
twenty five (25) Business Days after service of notice in accordance with
Clause 5.1.  
      
  5.5  |   | In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance
with Clause 5.4, neither Party shall have any claim under this Agreement of
any nature whatsoever against the other Party (except in respect of any
rights and liabilities which have accrued before termination in relation to
antecedent breaches and except in relation to any of the Surviving
Provisions).

be disruptive to the operations of such Acquired Company, to such Acquired
Companys personnel, properties, books and records for the purposes of
facilitating an orderly transition of the ownership of the Acquired Group
after Completion; _provided_ that no Seller or Acquired Company shall be
required to provide any information or access that such Person believes

confidentiality agreement or confidentiality provision in any Contract or
adversely impact any privilege, including legal professional privilege.

negative. If the Net Early Termination Amount is negative, the Purchasers
shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Sellers, by telegraphic transfer of
immediately available cleared funds, an amount equal to the Net
Early Termination Amount. If the Net Early Termination Amount is positive,
the Sellers shall pay, or cause to be paid, to the Purchasers, by telegraphic
transfer of immediately available cleared funds, an amount equal to the Net
Early Termination Amount. The Net Early Termination Amount shall be payable

---|---|--- 
      
  14.1  |   | Bloomfield  
      
  14.1.1  |   | As soon as reasonably practicable following Completion,
the US Purchaser and the US Seller (or such other Persons on their behalf as
they may reasonably nominate) will discuss in good faith and agree a course
of action as regards approaching the relevant governmental authority in New
Jersey (the " _NJ Authority_ ") with a view to agreeing, with the NJ
Authority, the appropriate course of action to be adopted to monitor and/or
remediate the environmental issues identified in the Sellers Disclosure
Letter at the site located at Bloomfield, New Jersey (the " _Environmental
Issues_ ") (the " _Remediation Plan_ "). If the Parties are unable to agree
on a course of action as regards such approach to the NJ Authority
(after having endeavoured to do so for a period of at least twenty (20)
Business Days), either Party may unilaterally make the approach.  
      
  14.1.2  |   | Following receipt of the determination by the NJ Authority
in relation to the Remediation Plan, the US Purchaser shall provide to the US
Seller details (procured from a suitably qualified firm of environmental
experts) as to the steps necessary, in the opinion of such firm, to be
adopted to implement the Remediation Plan and as to the costs thereof. If
such costs are less than the balance of the provision included in relation
thereto in the management accounts referred to at paragraph 5 of Schedule 5 (
_The Sellers  Warranties_) (the " _Provision_ ") (after allowing for any
expenditure incurred by the Acquired Group since 30 June 2007) (the "
_Balance_ "), then the US Seller shall have no further obligation under this
Clause 14.1.  
      
  14.1.3  |   | If such costs exceed the Balance, the US Seller may seek
from a firm of suitably qualified environmental experts a second quotation as
to the steps necessary to be adopted to implement the Remediation Plan and
the costs thereof.  
      
  14.1.4  |   | If the US Seller elects to obtain such a quotation and
provides details of such quotation to the US Purchaser, the Parties shall
proceed to instruct the firm providing the lower quote for the work required
under the Remediation Plan. If the US Seller does not obtain such a quote and
deliver the same to the US Purchaser within six (6) weeks of the receipt by
the US Seller of the quotation provided by the US Purchaser, the US Purchaser
may proceed to follow the steps (with the attendant costs) originally
proposed by it.  
      
  14.1.5  |   | In either case, to the extent that the costs incurred as
envisaged pursuant to Clause 14.1.4 exceed the Balance, the US Purchaser and
the US Seller shall bear the same as to fifty per cent. (50%) each.  
      
  14.1.6  |   | Save with the prior written consent of the US Purchaser
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), pending Completion
the US Seller shall procure that the Acquired Group does not incur any
(further) expenditure in connection with the Environmental Issues, unless the
Remediation Plan is issued by the NJ Authority prior to Completion, in which
event the above provisions of this Clause 14.1 as regards costs and the
sharing thereof shall apply  _mutatis mutandis_.  
      
  14.1.7  |   | Each of the US Purchaser and the US Seller undertakes to
the other to act in good faith in connection with the implementation of the
provisions of this Clause 14.1.

Feed Flexibility Project ISBL at Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana, as amended from
time to time up to Completion (the " _Westlake Contract_ ") exceeds by more
than five million dollars ($5,000,000) the aggregate amount received by such
Acquired Company under, or in relation to, the Westlake Contract (the portion
of such amount over and above five million dollars ($5,000,000), the "
_Excess Amount_ "), in each case from the date of this Agreement to the date
on which the warranty period under the Westlake Contract expires by its terms
(or, if later, the date on which the relevant Acquired Company makes the last
payment due by, or receives the last payment due to, it under the Westlake
Contract (such date, the " _Expiration Date_ "), then the US Seller shall pay
to the US Purchaser fifty per cent (50%) of the Excess Amount. Subject to the
US Purchaser complying with its obligations under Clauses 14.2.2(b) and
14.2.3, any payment required to be made by the US Seller under this Clause
14.2.1 shall be made within thirty (30) days of the Expiration Date.  
      
  14.2.2  |   | The US Purchaser shall deliver to the US Seller:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | after Completion, periodic statements, on a
quarterly basis, setting out a summary of all amounts paid or received by the
relevant Acquired Company in relation to the Westlake Contract during the
immediately preceding calendar quarter; and

supporting documentation), and access to the premises, books, accounting
records and other documentation, and all relevant personnel, of such Acquired
Company reasonably requested by the US Seller for purposes of verifying the
Excess Amount.

the Business infringes the Intellectual Property of any third Person, other

require a monetary payment by the Acquired Group of less than one million
dollars ($1,000,000) (following which payment the relevant Acquired Company
would be entitled to continue to use the relevant Intellectual Property, free
of charge).  
      
  12.5  |   | So far as the Sellers are aware, there is no current or
pending claim or litigation by any Acquired Company alleging that another
Person is infringing or has infringed any of the Intellectual Property owned

request in writing to avoid, dispute, defend, resist, appeal or compromise
any Claim for Tax (a " _Disputed Claim_ "), subject to the Sellers agreeing
(to the Purchasers reasonable satisfaction) to indemnify the Purchasers or
the relevant Acquired Company (as applicable) against any reasonable out-of-
pocket costs which it may suffer or incur as a result of taking such
action;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | make available to the Sellers such employees of the
relevant Acquired Company or the Purchasers as the Sellers may reasonably
require and all such information as may be available and as may reasonably be
requested by the Sellers for avoiding, disputing, resisting, appealing,
compromising or contesting any such Claim for Tax; and  
      
    | (c)  |   | not accept or pay or compromise any such Claim for Tax
without the Sellers prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed; and  
      
    | (d)  |   | not be required to take any action which it can
reasonably demonstrate would materially increase the Liability to Tax of any
Acquired Company in subsequent periods.  
   

  

     8.3  |   | The Sellers shall:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | keep the Purchasers fully informed of all
relevant matters known to them or the Sellers relevant advisers concerning
any Disputed Claim;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | provide the Purchasers with copies of all relevant
documents in the Sellers possession or control in relation to any Disputed
Claim;  
      
    | (c)  |   | not transmit to a Tax Authority any material
communication pertaining to the dispute and in particular no proposal for a
consent to any settlement or compromise without the same having been
submitted to and approved by the Purchasers, such approval not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed;  
      
    | (d)  |   | save where such Claim for Tax relates to the Brazilian
Dispute, not be entitled to resist any such Claim for Tax to the extent that
it would involve the Purchasers or any relevant Acquired Company contesting a
Disputed Claim beyond the first appellate body (excluding the Tax Authority
which has made the Disputed Claim) in the jurisdiction concerned unless Tax
counsel of appropriate seniority and experience appointed by the Sellers,
confirms that (taking into account, among other things, the quantum of the
relevant liability, the technical issues relevant to the Disputed Claim and
the likelihood of the Sellers successfully challenging such Claim for Tax) it
would be reasonable for the Sellers to pursue that course of action.  
   

  

     8.4  |   | If the Sellers do not request the relevant Acquired
Company to take any action within thirty (30) Business Days following the
Sellers receipt of written details relating to the Claim for Tax from the
Purchasers in accordance with paragraph 8.2 of this Schedule, the Purchasers
or any relevant Acquired Company shall be free to pay or settle the Claim for
Tax on such terms as it may in its absolute discretion consider
appropriate.  
---|---|--- 
   

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

     9.  |   | Payment of Disputed Claims  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | In respect of a Disputed Claim, the Sellers shall pay any
required sum under paragraph 2 of this Schedule within thirty (30) days
following settlement, compromise or abandonment of the Disputed Claim unless
the action requested by the Sellers pursuant to paragraph 7.3 of
this Schedule cannot be taken prior to the Tax the subject matter of the
Disputed Claim being paid (in which case, an amount equal to that amount of
Tax (a " _Disputed Tax Payment_ ") shall be paid by the Sellers promptly upon
receipt by the Sellers of a written notice from the Purchasers for that
amount). For the avoidance of doubt, if the Sellers are required to make a
Disputed Tax Payment and the Disputed Claim is settled or compromised for a
lesser sum than the amount of the Disputed Tax Payment, the difference between
the Disputed Tax Payment and the amount at which the Disputed Claim is
settled or compromised shall be treated as an amount to which paragraph 6 of
this Schedule applies.  
      
  10.  |   | Transfer Taxes  
      
    |   | The Purchasers shall be responsible for, and shall pay or cause
to be paid all stamp, transfer documentary, sales and use, VAT, registration
and other similar taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest)
incurred as a consequence of the transfer of any shares in the Acquired
Companies pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, the " _Transfer Taxes_
"), other than any Transfer Taxes which arise as a consequence of the making
of a section 338(h)(10) election.  
      
  11.  |   | Section 338(h)(10)  
      
  11.1  |   | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the US
Seller and the Purchasers (or the appropriate subsidiary thereof) shall
jointly complete and make a timely section 338(h)(10) election with respect
to the US Company and each of the eligible members of the US Acquired Group
on Form 8023 or in such other manner as may be required by rule or regulation
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and shall jointly make an election in
the manner required under any analogous provisions of state or local law with
respect to the US Company and each of the eligible members of the US Acquired
Group. The US Seller and the Purchasers shall prepare Form 8023 and all such
forms as are required as attachments to Form 8023 (and all forms
under analogous provisions of state or local law) in accordance with
applicable Tax laws. Such duly executed and completed forms as are required
to be filed under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and analogous provisions of
state or local law) shall be delivered by the US Seller and Purchasers to
each other.  
      
  11.2  |   | The US Seller and the Purchasers agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to perform or cause to be performed on or prior to the
Completion Date: (i) an initial valuation of assets of the US Company and the
eligible members of the US Acquired Group for purposes of Section 338 of the
Code; (ii) a computation of the aggregate deemed sale price (" _ADSP_ ")
(as defined under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4) with respect to
the US Company and each of the eligible members of the US Acquired Group; and
(iii) an allocation of ADSP of the US Company and the eligible members of the
US Acquired Group for purposes of Section 338 of the Code (collectively, the
" _338 Valuations and Allocations_ ").  
      
  11.3  |   | If the US Seller and the Purchasers agree upon the 338
Valuations and Allocations on or prior to the Completion Date, then such 338
Valuations and Allocations shall be used for purposes of all relevant
Returns, reports and filings, and neither the Seller nor the Purchasers
shall take any position that is inconsistent therewith.  
      
  11.4  |   | If the US Seller and the Purchasers cannot agree upon the
338 Valuations and Allocations on or prior to the Completion Date, then the
first public accounting firm of any of Deloitte, Ernst and Young, KPMG or
PriceWaterhouseCoopers in alphabetical order that is not currently serving as
the auditor of any of the US Seller, any US Company or the Purchasers (or as  
   

  

     

  ##### 

  

   

     

   

otherwise agreed between the US Seller and the Purchasers) shall be selected
to determine the 338 Valuations and Allocations. The 338 Valuations and
Allocations determined by such independent public accounting firm shall be
final and binding. The fees and expenses incurred with respect to the
independent public accounting firm performing the 338 Valuations and
Allocations shall be allocated fifty per cent. (50%) to the US Seller
and fifty per cent. (50%) to the Purchasers. The 338 Valuations and
Allocations determined pursuant to this paragraph 10.4 shall be used for
purposes of all relevant Returns, reports and filings, and neither the US
Seller nor the Purchasers shall take any position that is inconsistent
therewith. 

  

     11.5  |   | This Agreement shall constitute the US Companys plan
of complete liquidation for purposes of Section 332 of the Code.  
---|---|--- 
      
  11.6  |   | Except as provided in paragraph 11.1 of this Schedule, the
Purchasers shall not make any election under Section 338 of the Code.  
      
  12.  |   | Retention of Records  
      
  12.1  |   | The Purchasers shall and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Completion Date or such later
date as provided in paragraph 12.2 of this Schedule, retain all books,
records and other documents pertaining to the businesses of the Acquired
Companies in existence on the Completion Date and in accordance with paragraph
8.3(b) of this Schedule or as otherwise requested by the Sellers to make the
same available for inspection and copying by, and at the expense of, the
Sellers or any Affiliate or representative of the Sellers during reasonable
business hours, upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. No such
books, records or documents shall be destroyed after the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Completion Date by the Purchasers or any of the
Acquired Companies without first advising the Sellers in writing and giving
the Sellers a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession thereof.  
      
  12.2  |   | If any Claim for Tax is outstanding on the seventh (7th)
anniversary of the Completion Date, the Purchasers shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, retain all such books, records and other documents
referred to in paragraph 12.1 of this Schedule until such Claim for Tax has
been finally agreed or settled.

SCHEDULE 9 

   

ADDITIONAL COVENANT  

  

     1.  |   | Definitions and Interpretation  
---|---|--- 
      
    |   | In this Schedule, words and expressions defined in Schedule 1
(Definitions and Interpretation) shall have the same meanings when used
herein. In addition, in this Schedule:  
      
    |   | "DOJ" means the United States Department of Justice;  
      
    |   | "Report" means the report entitled "Due Diligence Review Report
 ABB Lummus Use of Intermediaries" dated 20 August 2007 and made available
to CBandIs attorneys on 21 August 2007 at the Washington, D.C. offices of WandC,
together with such report as updated, supplemented and amended from time to
time by or at the direction of the relevant member(s) of the ABB Group; and  
      
    |   | "SEC" means the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission.  
      
  2.  |   | Covenant  
      
  2.1  |   | Following Completion, the Sellers shall pay to the Purchasers
from time to time such sums as would, if paid to an Acquired Company or any
other member of the CBandI Group (including the Purchasers), indemnify and keep
indemnified that company against:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | any and all fines, other financial penalties and
disgorgement of profits or revenues imposed by the DOJ, the SEC or any other
Governmental Entity on any Acquired Company or any other member of the CBandI
Group;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | ninety (90) percent of any consultant, monitoring or
other similar out-of-pocket costs or expenses reasonably incurred by any
Acquired Company or any other member of the CBandI Group upon the requirement
of any Governmental Entity;  
      
    | (c)  |   | any damages payable by any Acquired Company pursuant to
any Contract, and any other damages payable by such Acquired Company or any
other member of the CBandI Group in respect of any claim (whether in tort or
otherwise) made by any Person in relation to any action derived from or
arising under or out of such Contract; and  
      
    | (d)  |   | any cancellation or termination fee payable by any
Acquired Company on termination of any Contract by any counterparty thereto
(or, in the case of a Contract with an agent or intermediary, by such
Acquired Company),  
   

   

to the extent that the same arise from any act or omission constituting a
violation by any Acquired Company of any Applicable Law concerning
contributions, gifts or other inducement payments (including in particular
any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of the United States (as
amended from time to time) through any payment to an intermediary) where such
act or omission occurred prior to Completion and is of the nature of the
issues identified in the Report, whether or not any such indemnity (if given
to any Acquired Company itself) would be invalid under any Applicable Law,
whether as a result of public policy issues or otherwise; provided that,
where such indemnification is in respect of a fine, other financial penalty
or disgorgement of profits or revenues, costs or damages payable by an
Acquired Company which is not a wholly-owned subsidiary of another
Acquired Company, the Sellers shall only be liable for such percentage of the
amount which, but for this proviso would be indemnifiable hereunder, is equal
to the percentage shareholding 

   ##### 

  

   

(whether direct or indirect) of the US Seller or the NL Seller, as the case
may be, in the relevant Acquired Company. 

  

     2.2  |   | Following Completion, the Sellers shall further pay to
the Purchasers from time to time such sums as would, if paid to an Acquired
Company or any other member of the CBandI Group (including the Purchasers),
indemnify and keep indemnified that company against ninety (90) percent
of any external legal fees and expenses reasonably incurred by any Acquired
Company or any other member of the CBandI Group:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | in complying with any requests made by the DOJ,
the SEC or any other Governmental Entity of any Acquired Company or any other
member of the CBandI Group in connection with payments to intermediaries and
other issues and subject matter identified in the Report; and  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | in defending any claims brought by the DOJ, the SEC or
any other Governmental Entity against any current and former director,
officer, employee, agent or distributor of any Acquired Company in connection
with payments to intermediaries and other issues and subject matter
identified in the Report, to the extent that any Acquired Company is obliged,
as of the Completion Date, to meet such legal fees and expenses,  
   

   

 _provided_ that, where such indemnification is in respect of external legal
fees or expenses incurred by an Acquired Company which is not a wholly-owned
subsidiary of another Acquired Company, the Sellers shall only be liable for
such percentage of the amount which, but for this proviso would be
indemnifiable hereunder, is equal to the percentage shareholding (whether
direct or indirect) of the US Seller or the NL Seller, as the case may be, in
the relevant Acquired Company; provided further that, in no event shall the
Sellers liability under paragraphs 2.2(a) and (b) above exceed ten million
dollars ($10,000,000) in aggregate. 

  

     2.3  |   | For the avoidance of doubt, the indemnification
provided in paragraphs 2.1 and 2.2 above shall not apply to:  
---|---|--- 
   

  

       | (a)  |   | any loss of profit arising from the termination
of any Contract, or from the suspension or debarment from any contracting
privileges; or  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | any legal fees or expenses incurred by any Acquired
Company or any other member of the CBandI Group beyond those expressly stated
at paragraph 2.2.  
   

  

     3.  |   | Access to Information  
---|---|--- 
      
  3.1  |   | From the date hereof to Completion, the Sellers shall cause
each Acquired Company to afford to the Purchasers and their attorneys such
reasonable access as they may from time to time reasonably request, during
normal business hours, to the personnel and books and records of the Acquired
Group, as well as legal, compliance and audit employees of the ABB Group and
the outside advisors and consultants of the ABB Group and the Acquired Group,
for the purposes of enabling the Purchasers to gain a better understanding
of, and the likely impact of, the issues and subject matter identified in the
Report, so as better to place the Purchasers in a position to ensure that any
violation by any Acquired Company of any Applicable Law
concerning contributions, gifts or other inducement payments (including in
particular the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of the United States (as amended
from time to time)) do not continue following Completion.  
      
  3.2  |   | Forthwith upon the execution of this Agreement, the Sellers
shall deliver to the Purchasers a copy of the report entitled "Due Diligence
Review Report  ABB Lummus Use of Intermediaries" dated 20 August 2007 and
made available to CBandIs attorneys on 21 August  
   

  

     

  ##### 

  

   

     

   

2007 at the Washington, D.C. offices of WandC. On Completion, the Sellers shall
deliver to the Purchasers a copy of all updates, supplements and amendments
thereto. 

  

     3.3  |   | All information made available pursuant to paragraph
3.1 above will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of the Common-
Interest Arrangement dated as of 20 August 2007 between ABB (on behalf of
itself and its relevant subsidiaries and affiliates) and CBandI (on behalf of
itself and its subsidiaries and affiliates) and the Report (delivered pursuant
to paragraph 3.2 above) will be dealt with in accordance with the terms of a
substitute or amended continuing common-interest arrangement to be entered
into allowing the Purchasers to retain a copy of the Report.  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.  |   | Co-operation  
      
  4.1  |   | The Purchasers are aware that members of the ABB Group intend
to make a voluntary disclosure to the DOJ and the SEC regarding payments to
intermediaries relating to foreign government contracts identified in the
Report. To facilitate such voluntary disclosure and subsequent co-operation,
following Completion the Purchasers shall co-operate, and shall procure that
the Acquired Group co-operates, with reasonable requests made by the relevant
members of the ABB Group to enable such members of the ABB Group to continue,
after Completion, their investigation into the payments to intermediaries
identified in the Report. Without prejudice to the generality of the
foregoing, the Purchasers shall:  
   

  

       | (a)  |   | notify the Sellers promptly in writing upon the
Purchasers learning of the existence of any material information which the
Purchasers reasonably conclude, after having made inquiries with the relevant
Acquired Companies, could potentially relate to the payments to
intermediaries and other issues and subject matter identified in
the Report;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | procure the Acquired Group to retain, maintain and
preserve all information (including documents, books, records, accounts,
papers, electronic data and other information in tangible or intangible form)
in the possession, custody or control of the Acquired Group potentially
related to the payments to intermediaries and other issues and subject matter
identified in the Report, including continuation of the records-retention
instructions identified in the Report, and preserving all relevant electronic
data, such as hard drives and back-up tapes of e-mail, server, financial, and
other electronic files;  
      
    | (c)  |   | procure the Acquired Group to provide the Sellers with
access to all information (including documents, books, records, accounts,
papers, electronic data and other information in tangible or intangible form)
in the possession, custody or control of the Acquired Group potentially
related to the payments to intermediaries and other issues and subject matter
identified in the Report and, upon the Sellers request, provide copies of
any such information in tangible form;  
      
    | (d)  |   | use all reasonable endeavours, and procure that the
Acquired Group uses all reasonable endeavours, to secure the co-operation of
any current and former directors, officers, employees, agents, distributors,
attorneys, outside consultants and members of internal audit who may have
knowledge potentially related to the payments to intermediaries and other
issues and subject matter identified in the Report;  
      
    | (e)  |   | refrain, and procure that the Acquired Group refrains,
from disclosing to any third party any information potentially related to the
payments to intermediaries and other issues and subject matter identified in
the Report in the absence of the Sellers prior written consent, except as
otherwise required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of the SEC
or any Governmental Entity;  
   

  

     

  ##### 

  

   

     

  

       | (f)  |   | consult, and procure that the Acquired Group
consults, with the Sellers prior to the Acquired Companies mounting any
defence, agreeing to any settlement or entering into any negotiations
concerning any allegation, claim or suit brought by the DOJ, the SEC or any
other any third party related to the payments to intermediaries and
other issues and subject matter identified in the Report;  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (g)  |   | consult, and procure that the Acquired Group consults,
with the Sellers regarding any disciplinary actions contemplated against any
current and former directors, officers, employees, agents, distributors,
attorneys, outside consultants and members of internal audit as a result of
their possible involvement in the payments to intermediaries identified in
the Report or their failure to co-operate with the relevant members of the
ABB Group in accordance with the terms of this paragraph 4.1; and  
      
    | (h)  |   | abide by the Sellers instructions as to whether to
assert or waive the Sellers potential attorney-client privilege or work-
product immunity with respect to communications and materials related to the
payments to intermediaries and other issues and subject matter identified in
the Report,  
   

   

 _provided_ that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers shall not be
deemed to be in default under this paragraph 4.1 to the extent that its
failure to procure any such matter as is referred to above in this paragraph
4.1 is attributable to any deliberate wrong-doing by any employee of any
Acquired Company. 

  

     4.2  |   | Save as may be required by any Governmental Entity,
members of the ABB Group, at their own cost, shall have exclusive authority
to investigate, respond to, defend, litigate and settle any and all
allegations, inquiries, proceedings, claims, charges, indictments and suits
that may give rise to an obligation to indemnify under paragraphs 2.1 or 2.2
above. The Sellers undertake to the Purchasers that the ABB Group will pursue
such matters diligently.  
---|---|--- 
      
  4.3  |   | Subject to paragraph 4.2, the Purchasers shall use, and,
following Completion, shall procure that the Acquired Group uses, all
reasonable endeavours to mitigate any potential liabilities that may give
rise to an obligation to indemnify under paragraphs 2.1 or 2.2 above
provided that, again, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchasers shall not
be deemed to be in default under this paragraph 4.3 to the extent that its
failure to procure that the Acquired Group uses, all reasonable endeavours to
mitigate any potential liabilities that may give rise to an obligation to
indemnify under paragraphs 2.1 or 2.2 is attributable to any
deliberate wrong-doing by any employee of any Acquired Company.  
      
  4.4  |   | The Purchasers undertake to the Sellers that, if the
Purchasers (or either of them), or any member of the CBandI Group, sells,
distributes or otherwise transfers to any third Person all or a substantial
portion of the Acquired Group or the Business, then the Purchasers shall
procure that the transferee first agrees in writing, in favour of the Sellers
and each other relevant member of the ABB Group, to be bound by the
provisions of this paragraph 4, mutatis mutandis, on the basis that
references in this paragraph 4 to the "Purchasers" shall be deemed to be
(or to include, as applicable) references to such transferee.  
      
  5.  |   | Termination  
      
  5.1  |   | Neither Seller shall be liable in respect of any claim under
paragraphs 2.1 or 2.2 above unless such claim is made by notice in writing to
the Sellers, specifying with particularity the matter giving rise to the
claim and the Governmental Entity involved, prior to the seventh anniversary
of the Completion Date.  
      
  5.2  |   | Neither Seller shall be liable for any claim under paragraphs
2.1 or 2.2 above with respect to any Acquired Company or any other member of
the CBandI Group after such Acquired  
   

  

     

  ##### 

  

   

     

   

Company or other member of the CBandI Group has ceased to be an Affiliate of
CBandI and the Sellers liability, if any, in respect of any such claim that is
then outstanding shall be immediately extinguished upon such Acquired Company
or other member of the CBandI Group ceasing to be an Affiliate of the
Purchasers; provided that the foregoing shall not apply if the Sellers have
approved the identity of the proposed transferee(s) (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).
