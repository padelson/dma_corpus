(including the definitions of the defined terms used in Section 3.3(a)), and,
with respect to each disputed item, the Independent Accountant's
determination, if not in accordance with the position of either Acquiror or
the Seller, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of
the amounts presented in Acquiror's calculation of the Adjustment Amount
pursuant to Section 3.3(a) or in the Seller's written notice of disagreement
of such calculation pursuant to this Section 3.3(c). The determination of the
Independent Accountant shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties
and no party shall seek further recourse to any Governmental Authority other
than to enforce the determination of the Independent Accountant. The Parties
acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 3.3 are an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without
these agreements, the parties would not enter into this Agreement. If Acquiror
or Seller fails promptly to pay any Adjustment Amount that may be payable to
the other Party in accordance with this Section 3.3, or if either Party fails
to give the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
this Section 3.3 and, in order to obtain such payment or delivery of the joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent, a Party commences an Action that
results in a judgment against the other Party for such Adjustment Amount or
for the delivery of the joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent, the
losing Party shall pay to the prevailing Party (or deliver the joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent directing it to pay), together with such
Adjustment Amount, in accordance with Section 3.3(a), interest on such
Adjustment Amount from the date Acquiror delivers to the Seller its

Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and the Closing Date Outstanding
Company Expenses at a rate per annum equal to the prime rate as published in
the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition, in effect on the date hereof. In

expenses (including legal fees) incurred by the prevailing Party in connection
with any such Action. The date on which the Closing Date Net Working Capital,
the Closing Date Funded Debt Amount, the Closing Date Cash Amount and the
Closing Date Outstanding Company Expenses are finally determined in accordance
with this Section 3.3(c) is hereinafter referred to as the "Determination
Date". All fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant relating to the
work, if any, to be performed by the Independent Accountant hereunder shall be
borne by the Parties in proportion to the amount by which their respective
initial positions vary from the Independent Accountant's final determination.
Within five (5) Business Days of the Determination Date, the applicable Party
shall pay the other Party pursuant to either Section 3.3(a)(i) or Section
3.3(a)(ii), as applicable.

| 

 





prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, such Tax
Return (taking into account any applicable extensions to file such Tax
Return). To the extent such Tax Return relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including a Straddle Tax Period), Acquiror agrees that (i) such Tax Return
shall be prepared and timely filed in a manner consistent with the most recent
past practice of the Company and Company Subsidiaries and the other agreements
relating to Tax matters set forth in this Section 8.4 (except as otherwise
required by Law); and (ii) such Tax Return shall be delivered to the Seller
for review at least twenty (20) days prior to the intended filing date. Seller
shall deliver to the Acquiror any comments at least ten (10) days prior to the

(b)Acquiror shall consider in good faith, and the Seller shall consider in
good faith, any timely comments made by the other Party to any Tax Return
prepared under Section 8.4(a) or an amendment to a Pre-Closing Tax Return
under Section 8.4(e). The Seller and Acquiror shall work in good faith to
resolve any disagreements relating to any Tax Return of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (including a Straddle Tax
Period) that is to be filed following the Closing Date. In the event that the
Parties cannot resolve their disagreement, the matter shall be submitted to
the Independent Accountant to resolve in accordance with the principles
provided for in Section 3.3, provided that if such disagreement is not
resolved by the Independent Accountant or otherwise prior to the due date of
such Tax Return (after taking into account applicable extensions), the
Acquiror shall timely file (or cause to be timely filed) the Tax Return as
prepared under Section 8.4(a) (subject to whatever changes as agreed by the
Seller and Acquiror prior to filing) and once the disagreement is resolved,
the Acquiror shall file, or cause to be filed, an amendment to such Tax Return
as necessary to reflect the final determination by the Independent Accountant
or otherwise. To the extent that any such amendment shows a refund of a Tax
that was paid out of the Indemnification Escrow Funds, the Acquiror shall
promptly return such amount to the Escrow Agent to be held under the Escrow
Agreement (or, if the Escrow Agreement has been terminated, to the Seller for
distribution to the Escrow Agent) and to the extent that any such amendment
shows a Tax for which the Acquiror Indemnified Party is to be indemnified
under Section 11.2(a), such amount shall be remitted to the Acquiror in
accordance with Article XI and other applicable agreements.



(c)Each Party agrees to, and agrees to cause their Affiliates to, cooperate
fully, as reasonably requested by the other Party, in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return of the Seller, Company or any Company Subsidiary
for a period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Tax Period
and the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim. Such cooperation shall include the
retention of and (upon the other Party's request) the provision of records and
information reasonably relevant to the Tax matters and making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide the additional
information.



(d)Acquiror shall promptly notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by any
Acquiror Indemnified Party or any of their Affiliates of any written notice
from any Governmental Authority of an Action with respect to Taxes or Tax
Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that could give rise to a
claim for indemnification under Section 11.2(a) (a "Tax Contest Claim"). Such
notice shall include a copy of any correspondence and any other written
material receiving from the applicable Governmental Authority. Acquiror and
the Seller shall in accordance with Section 8.4(c) cooperate with each

| 

 



other in the conduct of a Tax Contest Claim and, as necessary or requested,
provide (or cause the applicable Acquiror Indemnified Party to provide) any
power of attorneys with respect to such Tax Contest Claim. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, the Seller shall have the right to control
any Tax Contest Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company
or Company Subsidiary which could result in a Tax that is subject to
indemnification under Section 11.2(a) (any such claim, a "Seller's Tax Contest
Claim"); provided that if the resolution or settlement of such Seller's Tax
Contest Claim could have an adverse effect on any Acquiror Indemnified Party
in a Post-Closing Tax Period, (i) the Seller shall keep the Acquiror informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Seller's Tax Contest
Claim; (ii) Acquiror shall be entitled at its expense to participate in such
Seller's Tax Contest Claim; and (iii) the Seller shall not compromise or
settle any such Seller's Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Acquiror's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned). Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Acquiror shall control the conduct of any Tax Contest Claim
that the Seller does not have the right to control, or has not yet elected to
control; provided that (x) Acquiror shall keep the Seller informed regarding
the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax Contest Claim; (y) the Seller
shall be entitled at its expense to participate in such Tax Contest Claim; and
(z) the Acquiror shall not, and shall not allow the Acquiror Indemnified
Party, to settle any such Tax Contest Claim without obtaining the Seller's
prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed). Seller shall be solely responsible for contesting an
Action with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Seller, including those
that relate to operations of the Company.



(e)After the Closing Date, except as required by Law or with the prior written
consent of the Seller (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed),
Acquiror shall not, and shall not cause or allow any other Acquiror
Indemnified Party, to take any of the following actions with respect to a Tax
Return of the Company or any Company Subsidiary that relates to a period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date or a Straddle Tax Period: (i) file an
amended Tax Return; (ii) make or change any Tax election; (iii) adopt or
change any Tax accounting method; (iv) change any Tax accounting period; (v)
agree to extend any statute of limitations with respect to Taxes of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary; (vi) initiate any voluntary disclosure with
respect to any Tax matter; or (vii) take any similar action relating to Taxes
or Tax Returns of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. After the Closing
Date, if the Seller requests that an amendment to a Pre-Closing Tax Return be
filed, Seller shall deliver to the Acquiror such amendment at least (20) days
prior to the intended filing date for Acquiror's review and filing pursuant to
Section 8.4(b).



(f)To the extent permitted under applicable Law, each Party agrees, and to
cause each of its Affiliates, to elect for all relevant Tax purposes to end
the fiscal year of the Company as of the Closing Date. The amount of any
property taxes or similar ad valorem Tax or franchise Tax for a Straddle Tax
Period that is apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Tax
Period shall equal the amount of the Tax for the entire Straddle Tax Period
multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the
period ending on or before the Closing Date and the denominator of which is
the days in the entire period. The amount of any Income Tax or other Tax that
is not a property or similar ad valorem Tax for any Straddle Tax Period that
is apportioned to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Tax

Period will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date and the determination of net income for
such period.



(g)Except as otherwise required by Law, the Parties agree to treat for all Tax
purposes all indemnification payments under Article XI or payments with
respect to refunds under this Article VIII as adjustments to the Purchase
Price.

(ii)any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
requiring performance by the Company or the Seller prior to or at the Closing
or by the Seller after the Closing;



(iii)any Pre-Closing Taxes (except to the extent amounts with respect to such
Taxes were taken into account in the calculation of the Closing Date Net
Working Capital);



(iv)any non-compliance by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, with the

permit allowing 70,000 MT of production per year.



(c)Subject to Section 11.4, from and after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall
indemnify, defend and hold the Seller harmless for any and all Damages to the
extent arising from:

| 

 



(i)any breach of any representation or warranty Acquiror has made in Article
V; or



(ii)any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
requiring performance by Acquiror prior to or at the Closing or by Acquiror or
the Company after the Closing.



(d)The amount of any Damages payable to the Acquiror Indemnified Parties by
the Seller shall reflect that Acquiror was the owner of 30% of the equity of
the Company prior to Closing. Pre-Closing Taxes is defined to include only 70%
of the Taxes of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to all
Pre-Closing Tax Periods to reflect this concept. Any other claims for Damages
where the damage is due to the reduction of value of the Company or similar
concept shall include only 70% of the reduction in the value of the Company.



(e)The amount of indemnification to which an Indemnified Party shall be
entitled under this Article XI shall be determined: (i) by the written
agreement between the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor; (ii) by a final
judgment or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction; or (iii) by any
other means to which the Indemnified Party and the Indemnitor shall agree. The
judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time for appeal,
if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or when all
appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnified Party shall
have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Damages suffered by it.



Section 11.3 Indemnification Claim Procedures.



(a)Upon receipt of any notice of an Action that may give rise to an
Indemnification Claim by a Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall
promptly (i) notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor and (ii) deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Indemnitor a written notice (A) describing in
reasonable detail the nature of the Action, (B) including a copy of all papers
served with respect to such Action, (C) including the Indemnified Party's best
estimate of the amount of Damages that may arise from such Action and (D)
describing in reasonable detail the basis for the Indemnified Party's request
for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Indemnitor in
accordance with this Section 11.3(a) will not relieve the Indemnitor of any
liability that it may have to the Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1)
the defense of such Action is prejudiced by the Indemnified Party's failure to
give or cause to be given such notice or (2) the Indemnified Party fails to
notify or cause to be notified the Indemnitor of such Indemnification Claim in
accordance with this Section 11.3(a) prior to the Survival Expiration Date.



(b)An Indemnitor may elect at any time to assume and thereafter conduct the
defense of any Action subject to any such Indemnification Claim with counsel
of the Indemnitor's choice and to settle or compromise any such Action, and
each Indemnified Party shall cooperate in all respects with the conduct of
such defense by the Indemnitor (including the making of any related claims,
counterclaim or cross complaint against any Person in connection with the
Action) and/or the settlement of such Action by the Indemnitor; provided,
however, that


 

--- 
| | 

|

51

| 

 



the Indemnitor shall not agree to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement or compromise with respect to such Action without the Indemnified
Party's prior written approval (which must not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), unless the terms of such settlement provide for a complete release
of the claims that are the subject of such Action in favor of the Indemnified
Party. If the Indemnified Party gives an Indemnitor notice of an
Indemnification Claim and the Indemnitor does not thereafter promptly assume
such defense, then the Indemnified Party may conduct the defense of such
Action; provided, however, that (A) the Indemnified Party will not agree to
the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with
respect to such Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnitor
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and (B) the
Indemnitor may thereafter assume at any time the defense of such Action. To
the extent the defense of any Action subject to any Indemnification Claim is
assumed by the Seller as the Indemnitor, at the election of the Indemnitor,
the costs and expenses of such defense of, and any payment in respect of, any
Action, including any settlement thereof, shall be paid from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds and Acquiror and the Seller shall promptly submit
joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to
disburse such portion of the Indemnification Escrow Funds as is reasonably
requested in writing by the Seller to pay such costs and expenses or other
amounts; provided, however, that no amounts will be payable from the
Indemnification Escrow Funds, unless the Indemnified Party is actually
entitled to indemnification hereunder.



(c)At the reasonable request of the Indemnitor, each Indemnified Party shall
grant the Indemnitor and its representatives all reasonable access to the
books, records, employees and properties of such Indemnified Party to the
extent reasonably related to the matters to which the applicable
Indemnification Claim relates



. All such access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be
granted under the conditions which shall not unreasonably interfere with the
business and operations of such Indemnified Party.

Section 11.4 Limitations on Indemnification Liability



. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any claims
an Indemnified Party makes under this Article XI will be limited as follows:

(a)Indemnification Cap. The aggregate amount of Damages for which the Acquiror
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 11.2(a)(i) (except for any breach of a Fundamental Representation or
of any representation and warranty in Section 4.14 (Taxes)) will not exceed an
amount equal to 20% of the Purchase Price. The aggregate amount of Damages for
which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Article XI shall not exceed the Purchase Price.



(b)Claims Basket



. The Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for breaches of
Fundamental Representations) to the extent the aggregate amount of all Damages
incurred by the Acquiror Indemnified Parties for


 

--- 
| | 

|

52

| 

 



which the Acquiror Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.2(a)(i) (other than for claims for breaches of
Fundamental Representations) exceeds an amount equal to 2% of the Purchase
Price (the "Basket Amount"), and once the aggregate amount of such Damages
exceeds the Basket Amount, the Acquiror Indemnified Parties shall be entitled
to indemnification for all Damages. The Basket Amount shall not apply to any
indemnification claims under Section 11.2(a)(ii), Section 11.2(a)(iii),
Section 11.2(a)(iv), Section 11.2(a)(v) or Section 11.2(b) or for claims under
Section 11.2(a)(i) for breaches of Fundamental Representations or the
representations and warranties in Section 4.14 (Taxes).

(c)Damages Net of Insurance Proceeds and Other Third-Party Recoveries



. All Damages for which any Indemnified Party would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds, indemnification payments and other third-party recoveries
to which any Indemnified Party is entitled in respect of any Damages incurred
by such Indemnified Party. In the event any Indemnified Party or any of its
Affiliates may be entitled to any insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or
any third-party recoveries in respect of any Damages (or any of the
circumstances giving rise thereto) for which such Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI, such Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, receive or realize
such proceeds, benefits, payments or recoveries. In the event that any such
insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other third-party recoveries are
obtained, received or realized by an Indemnified Party subsequent to receipt
by such Indemnified Party of any indemnification payment hereunder in respect
of the claims to which such insurance proceeds, indemnity payments or other
third-party recoveries relate, appropriate refunds shall be made promptly by
the relevant Indemnified Parties of all or the relevant portion of such
indemnification payment.

(d)Assignment of Claims



. If any Indemnified Party receives any indemnification payment pursuant to
this Article XI, at the election of the Indemnitor, such Indemnified Party
shall assign to the Indemnitor all of its claims for recovery against third
Persons as to such Damages, whether by insurance coverage, contribution
claims, subrogation or otherwise.

(e)Calculation of Damages



. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes of
determining whether there has been a breach or an inaccuracy of any
representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining the amount of
Damages resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in any
representation or warranty relating to or referring to the terms "material",
"materiality", or "in all material respects" or any similar term or phrase
will be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that for the
purposes of determining liability under this Article XI, the representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will be read as if
such terms and phrases were not included in them; provided, however, that the
foregoing shall not apply to (i) the term "Material Permit" or when used as an
adjective in any definition set forth in Section 1.1 and (ii) any
representation or warranty set forth in (A) the last sentence of Section 4.7;
(B) Sections 4.11(a)(viii), (xiii) and (xvi); (C) the first sentence of
Section 4.12(a); (D) Section 4.18(f); (E) Section 4.19(a); (F) the first
sentence of Section 4.21(a);


 

--- 
| | 

|

53

| 

 



(G) Section 4.21(f); (H) the first sentence of Section 4.22; and (I) the
second sentence of Section 4.23.

(f)Damages Reserved for on the Post-Closing Statement or Included in Purchase
Price



. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for any
Damages (i) in respect of any liability or obligation accrued or reserved for
on the Post-Closing Statement or (ii) in respect of any liability included in
the calculation of the Purchase Price.

(g)No Duplicate Claims



. In the event an Acquiror Indemnified Party or the Seller, as the case may
be, recovers Damages in respect of an Indemnification Claim, no other Acquiror
Indemnified Party or the Seller, as applicable, may recover the same Damages
in respect of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement.

(h)Limitations on Tax Indemnification



. No Acquiror Indemnified Party shall be indemnified for the following Taxes
(or related Damages): (i) any Tax with respect to a Post-Closing Tax Period
(other than such Taxes arising from a breach of a representation in Section
4.14(l)); (ii) any Tax attributable to a breach of the Acquiror or its
Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) of any provision of
this Agreement; or (iii) any Tax to the extent included in the computation of
the Purchase Price.

Section 11.5 Mitigation of Damages



. An Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate any
Damages for which it is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article
XI.

Section 11.6 Indemnification Sole and Exclusive Remedy



. Each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that from and after the Closing,
except for intentional fraud, claims under this Article XI shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Acquiror and each of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties hereby waives, from and
after the Closing, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action it may have against any
indemnifying party relating to the subject matter of this Agreement based upon
predecessor or successor liability, contribution, tort, strict liability or
any Law or otherwise. All representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement are contractual in nature only and subject to the sole and exclusive
remedies set forth in this Article XI. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing:

(a)each of Acquiror hereby waives any statutory and common law remedies,
including remedies that may be available under Environmental Laws, with
respect to matters relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including with respect to any environmental, health or safety matters);


 

--- 
| | 

|

54

| 

 



(b)after the Closing Date, none of the Acquiror Indemnified Parties may seek
the rescission of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



(c)the provisions of and the limited remedies provided in this Article XI were
specifically bargained for between the Parties and were taken into account by
the Parties in arriving at the Purchase Price;



(d)the Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights, liabilities and
obligations respecting the Transaction and the other transactions contemplated
hereby exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and provisions of
this Agreement;



(e)the sole and exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions
of this Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth
herein, made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement) or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related
to the Transaction or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach of contract
only (as such contractual remedies have been further limited or excluded
pursuant to the express terms of this Agreement); and the Parties hereby agree
that no Party shall have any remedies or cause of action (whether in contract
or in tort) for any statements, communications, disclosures, failures to
disclose, representations or warranties not set forth in this Agreement;



(f)the Parties each hereby acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the
justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from arm's-length
negotiations and the Parties specifically acknowledge that no Party has any
special relationship with another Party that would justify any expectation
beyond that of an ordinary buyer and an ordinary seller in an arm's-length
transaction; and



(g)for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustments made to the Purchase Price
pursuant to Section 3.3 shall not be considered "remedies" for purposes of
this Section 11.6 and shall not be limited by the terms of this Section 11.6.



Section 11.7 Release of Escrow



. The Escrow Agreement shall specify that:

(a)on the first Business Day following the eighteen-month anniversary of the
Closing, the Escrow Agent shall pay to Seller so much of the Indemnification
Escrow Funds (if any) so that the balance remaining shall not be in excess of
$12,000,000 plus the aggregate amount reasonably attributable to any Pending
Claim(s);



(b)the Indemnification Escrow Funds shall be released to the Seller on the
first Business Day following the thirty-six-month anniversary of the Closing;
provided, however, that, (i) the Indemnification Escrow Funds released to the
Seller shall be the amount of Indemnification Escrow Funds then held by the
Escrow Agent, less the aggregate amount reasonably attributable to such
Pending Claim(s), and (ii) any funds that remain in escrow following the
Survival Expiration Date in respect of any such Pending Claim shall be
released to the Seller promptly upon resolution or (if applicable)
satisfaction of such Pending Claim; and

|

55

| 

 



(c)in each case in which this Section 11.7 provides for the release of
Indemnification Escrow Funds, each of Acquiror and the Seller shall promptly
submit joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow
Agent to distribute the Indemnification Escrow Funds in accordance with this

the United States of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and each of
the Parties irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of each such
court in any such Action, waives any objection it may now or hereafter have to

claims in respect of the Action shall be heard and determined only in any such
court, and agrees not to bring any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any other court. Nothing

process in any manner permitted by Law or to commence legal proceedings or

AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF
THE PARTIES IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

Section 12.14 Enforcement



. Each Party agrees that irreparable damage for which monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that
the Parties do not perform their obligations under the provisions of this
Agreement (including failing to take such actions as are required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms
or otherwise breach such provisions. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that
(a) the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific performance, or
other equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof, without proof of damages, prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement in accordance with Section 10.1, in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled under this Agreement,
and (b) the right of specific performance is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, none of
the Parties would have entered into this Agreement. Each Party agrees that it
will not oppose the granting of specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or
that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at Law or equity. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that any Party
seeking an injunction to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in accordance with
this Section 12.14 shall not be required to provide any bond or other security
in connection with any such injunction. For the avoidance of doubt, while the
Company may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
this Section 12.14 and concurrently pursue the payment of any damages under
Section 10.2, under no circumstances shall the Company be permitted or
entitled to receive both (A) a grant of specific performance that results in a
Closing (and the payment of any fees, costs and expenses (including legal
fees) incurred by or on behalf of the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the Company's pursuance of such
grant of specific performance, which Acquiror shall pay or cause to be paid to
the Company (such payment shall be deemed to have been made prior to 11:59
p.m. Illinois time on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date) if the
Company is actually granted specific performance in accordance with this
Section 12.14) and (B) damages under Section 10.2.
