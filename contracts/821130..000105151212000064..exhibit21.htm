(c) All other assets of Seller and its Affiliates, including the

Section 1.2. _Assumption of Liabilities_

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions hereof, at Closing
the applicable Purchaser will, or will cause an affiliate of Purchaser to,
assume from each of the applicable Seller Entities, as of the Closing Date,
the payment, discharge and performance of the following liabilities and
obligations, without duplication (collectively, the " _Assumed Liabilities_
"):

  

 (i) all liabilities and obligations relating to periods after the Closing Date under and with respect to the Seller Assigned Licenses, including without limitation, any liabilities and obligations relating to periods after the Closing Date out of any Federal or State Law, rule of the FCC or applicable state regulatory commission or any other Governmental Authority to which the Seller Assigned Licenses, or the Customer Agreements are subject; 

  

 (ii) all liabilities and obligations relating to periods after the Closing Date under the Customer Agreements; and 

  

 (iii) all liabilities and obligations set forth on _Schedule 1.2(a)(iii)_ arising with respect to Customers, including unearned or deferred revenues or activation fees, customer deposits and prepayments, and loyalty reward points (subject to Purchaser's preferred method of administration and redemption regarding such loyalty reward points), in each case only to the extent included in Section 1.4.

  

(b) Neither Purchaser nor any of its Affiliates shall assume or
undertake in any way to perform, pay, satisfy or discharge any liability or
obligation of Seller or any of its Affiliates of any nature whatsoever,
whether known or unknown, determined or undetermined, liquidated or

limitation, any liabilities and obligations (i) in connection with device
insurance of the Customers or (ii) relating to periods prior to or on the

(collectively, the " _Excluded Liabilities_ ").

  

Section 1.3. _Like-Kind Exchange; Purchase Price Allocation_

  

(a) Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate, if requested, in enabling
Seller or any Seller Entity to effectuate a like-kind exchange under Section
1031 of the Code through the assignment of all or any portion of the rights of
Seller or any such entity pursuant to this Agreement to a "qualified
intermediary" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4);
provided however, that (i) none of Purchaser's rights and none of Seller's
obligations to Purchaser in respect of this Agreement shall be diminished or
otherwise affected by any such assignment, (ii) Purchaser shall not be
required to incur any additional cost or expense in connection with such
cooperation, (iii) the Closing shall not be conditioned on the transactions
hereunder qualifying as part of a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the
Code, and (iv) Purchaser and its Affiliates shall not be responsible,
financially or otherwise, or otherwise liable for Seller's inability to
achieve its desired tax treatment. Seller acknowledges and agrees that Seller
shall obtain its own separate tax advice with respect to any transaction
Seller may undertake to effect as a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of
the Code, and Seller is not relying on any representations from Purchaser with
respect to such characterization.

  

(b) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate reasonably with each other
in sharing information in order to assist each other in allocating to the
Purchased Assets for tax purposes, as appropriate, the Purchase Price, any
Assumed Liabilities and any proration of revenues, expenses and other items
relating to the conveyance of the Purchased Assets from Seller to Purchaser.

  

Section 1.4. _Allocation of Certain Items 

_

  

(a) With respect to the Closing, allocation of all (i) revenues and
receivables relating to Customers (including with respect to roaming, on a net
basis), (ii) deposits, prepayments and prepaid assets, and (iii) all
liabilities and obligations assumed pursuant to Section 1.2(a)(iii) will be
made as of the Closing Date, with Seller having the obligation and receiving
the benefit of such items prior to and as of the Closing Date, and Purchaser
having the obligation and receiving the benefit of items after the Closing
Date. Any amounts due Purchaser under this Section 1.4 will be credited
towards amounts payable by Seller under the terms of the Network Transition
Services Agreement and the Customer Transition Services Agreement.

  

(b) An example of the pro-ration contemplated by this Section 1.4 is
attached hereto as _Schedule 1.4(b)_.

be made, any material commitments to any Governmental Authority relating to
any Governmental Authorization affecting the Seller Assigned Licenses without

taking any action or omitting to take any action with respect to any service
areas which are not covered by any Seller Assigned License created by
partitioning a Seller FCC Authorization, so long as the taking of such action
or omission to take such action does not otherwise result in a breach by
Seller of this Section 5.1(d).

 (i) Give written notice to the other party promptly upon the commencement of, or upon obtaining Knowledge of any facts that would give rise to a threat of, any claim, action or proceeding commenced against or relating to it, its Affiliates or its or their properties or assets which would reasonably be expected to prevent, or otherwise materially interfere with, the performance by the notifying party or its Affiliates of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) After obtaining Knowledge of the occurrence of any event, or any occurrence which would reasonably be expected to give rise to an event, which could cause or constitute a material breach of any of its warranties, representations, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, promptly give notice in writing of such occurrence or event to the other party and use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prevent or to promptly remedy such breach; and

other Transaction Document or to cure any misrepresentation or breach of
warranty, representation, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
any other Transaction Document.

which is inconsistent with or intended to delay action on such applications or
consummation of the Transactions. Each Purchaser Entity and each Seller
Entity, respectively, shall bear its own costs associated with the preparation
and submission of such filings, including applicable FCC application fees.

  

(b) Purchaser and Seller, on behalf of the Seller Entities, shall use
its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to secure before the Closing Date any
Consent (other than the Consent of the FCC), in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the other party, from any Governmental Authority as is
necessary to be obtained by it in order to consummate the Transactions.
Purchaser and Seller, on behalf of the Seller Entities, shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cooperate with the other party, as
reasonably requested, to obtain such Consents.

  

(c) (i) Seller and Purchaser shall each cooperate and
use their Commercially Reasonable Efforts to prepare and file with the Federal
Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice ("
_DOJ_ ") within 15 Business Days after the date hereof, all requisite
applications and amendments thereto together with related information, data
and exhibits necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") (if
applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) and to supply
as promptly as practical any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall
each pay their own filing fees in connection with any filings pursuant to this
Section 5.2(c).

  

 (ii) Each party to this Agreement shall promptly notify the other party of any substantive oral or written communication it receives from any Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this Agreement, permit the other party to review in advance any substantive communication proposed to be made by such party to any Governmental Authority and provide the other party with copies of all correspondence, filings or other communications between them or any of their Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand. No party to this Agreement shall agree to participate in any meeting or discussion with any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings, investigation, or other inquiry unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority and applicable Law, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the parties to this Agreement will coordinate and cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and in seeking termination of any applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act.

  

 (iii) Without limiting any other provision contained in this Agreement, each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act. 

  

 (iv) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser acknowledges on behalf of itself and its Affiliates and its and their Representatives, successors and assigns, that the benefits and burdens of the ownership and use of the Purchased Assets shall remain in the dominion and control of Seller until the Closing and that none of Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or its or their respective successors or assigns will provide, directly or indirectly, any directions, orders, advice, aid, assistance or information to any director, officer or employee of Seller, except as specifically contemplated or permitted by this Agreement or as otherwise consented to in writing in advance by an executive officer of Seller.

  

  

       

  

  

 

  

Section 5.3. _Prohibited Transactions_

  

Between the date of execution of this Agreement and the earlier to occur of
the Closing or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
Seller and its Affiliates and Representatives, will not directly or indirectly
solicit, encourage or initiate the submission of proposals or offers from,
provide any confidential information to, or participate in discussions or
negotiations or enter into any agreement, arrangement or understanding with
any Person concerning the Transfer of, or create, incur or suffer to exist any
Lien of any nature whatsoever in respect of the Purchased Assets (other than
Permitted Liens or as otherwise permitted by Section 5.6); provided, that the
foregoing shall not prohibit Seller from taking any action or omitting to take
any action with respect to any service areas which are not covered by any
Seller Assigned License created by partitioning a Seller FCC Authorization, so
long as the taking of such action or omission to take such action does not
otherwise result in a breach by Seller of this Section 5.3. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict Seller or any
of its Affiliates from the Transfer of the assets which are otherwise required
to be conveyed by it at Closing to a third party, provided, that any such
Transfer must be pursuant to another transaction in which (x) such assets,
taken as a whole, constitute an immaterial or incidental portion of the assets
being transferred, assigned or disposed of pursuant to such other transaction
and (y) the acquirer or the assignee or transferee of such assets (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) expressly agrees and is obligated to consummate
or cause the consummation of the Transactions in accordance with the terms
hereof, without delay or impairment to the Transactions.

  

Section 5.4. _Confidentiality _

  

(a) Each party shall, and shall cause each of its Representatives
to, (A) retain in strictest confidence any and all Confidential Information
relating to the other party that it receives in connection with the
negotiation or performance of this Agreement and each other Transaction
Document (whether received prior to or after the date of this Agreement), and
(B) not disclose such Confidential Information to anyone except (x) the
receiving party's Affiliates and Representatives and (y) any other Person that
needs to know such Information for purposes of performance of this Agreement
and each other Transaction Document and who agrees to keep in confidence all
Confidential Information in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.4 as
if it were the receiving party hereunder. Each party agrees to use
Confidential Information received from the other party only in furtherance of
the performance of this Agreement, and not for any other purpose. All
Confidential Information furnished pursuant to this Agreement and each other
Transaction Document shall either be returned promptly to the party to whom it
belongs, or destroyed and such destruction certified, in either case upon
request made prior to Closing by such party.

  

(b) The obligations set forth in paragraph (a) above shall not apply
to Confidential Information that (A) is or becomes generally available to the
public other than as a result of disclosure by the receiving party or its
Affiliates or its Representatives in violation of this Section 5.4, (B) was
available to the receiving party on a non-confidential basis prior to its
disclosure to the receiving party, or (C) becomes available to the receiving
party on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the providing
party, its Affiliates or its Representatives, provided, that such source is
not known by the receiving party to be bound by a confidentiality agreement
with the providing party, its Affiliates or its Representatives. Confidential
Information with respect to the Purchased Assets shall be deemed to be
Confidential Information of Purchaser, from and after the Closing.

  

(c) Anything else in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document notwithstanding, each party shall have the right to disclose any
information, including Confidential Information of the other party or such
other party's Affiliates: (A) to its Representatives (such Representatives to
acknowledge that any such Confidential Information disclosed to them is
subject to the provisions hereof); (B) in any filing with any regulatory
agency, court, or other authority (in confidence, if and where a procedure for
confidential disclosure exists) or any disclosure to a trustee of public debt
of a party to the extent that the disclosing party determines in good faith
that it is required by Law or the terms of such debt to do so; provided, that
any such disclosure shall be as limited in scope as possible and shall be made
only after giving the other party as much notice as practicable of such
required disclosure and an opportunity to contest such disclosure, or seek
confidential treatment, if possible; (C) as required by its existing or
potential lending sources (such lending sources to acknowledge that any such
Confidential Information disclosed to them is subject to the provisions
hereof); or (D) as required to enforce its rights under this Agreement or any
Transaction Document.

  

(d) The parties agree that except as may be necessary to comply with
the requirements of applicable Law or the rules and regulations of any
national securities exchange upon which the securities of one of the parties
or its Affiliates is listed, no press release or similar public announcement
or communication will be made or caused to be made concerning the execution of
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or the consummation of the
Transactions, provided, that in the case of any disclosure permitted under
this paragraph (d), the disclosing party shall (A) prior to the proposed
disclosure, permit the non-disclosing party to review and comment on such
proposed disclosure and (B) not publish or otherwise release to the public any
proposed disclosure unless the non-disclosing party has first approved the
same, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

       

  

  

  

Section 5.5. _Access and Information_

  

From the date hereof until Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause the Seller
Entities to, give Purchaser and its Representatives reasonable access, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable prior notice, to the Purchased
Assets, and to records, books, contracts and documents related to the
Purchased Assets, and to such other information related to the Purchased
Assets as Purchaser may reasonably request, and in each case to the extent
reasonably necessary to Transfer to Purchaser the ownership of the Purchased
Assets. Any such access shall be coordinated through Sandi Pellow, Seller's
Enterprise Program Director (office telephone: (918) 697-9177; e-mail:
sandi.pellow@uscellular.com) or another individual appointed by Seller to
Purchaser in writing. Neither Purchaser nor its Representatives shall contact
any employees of the Seller Business without first obtaining the consent of
Sandi Pellow or any other appointed individual. Seller shall cause the
appropriate officers, employees, consultants, agents, accountants and
attorneys of the Seller Entities to cooperate with Purchaser and its
Representatives in connection with such access. This Section 5.5 shall not
entitle Purchaser to receive or review, or have access to, information that
(x) is subject to a confidentiality agreement or other contractual
confidentiality obligation with a third party, provided, that Seller shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain the Consent of any such third party
to permit Purchaser to receive and review such information or (y) access
thereto would result in a violation of applicable Law.

  

Section 5.6. _Conduct of Business_

  

During the period from the date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the
termination of this Agreement, except as required by Law or otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement, Seller covenants and agrees that it
shall, and shall cause each Seller Entity to, operate the Seller Business in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice. In
furtherance, but without limitation, of the foregoing, Seller shall, and shall
cause each Seller Entity to:

  

(a) maintain the Purchased Assets in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice;

  

(b) use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to preserve its goodwill
and maintain its relationships with the suppliers, employees, agents,
customers and others having material business relations with it consistent
with past practice;

  

(c) solicit new customers and provide services to existing customers
generally consistent with past practice;

  

(d) preserve in full force and effect, as necessary and consistent
with past practice, all Governmental Authorizations relating to the ownership
and use of the Purchased Assets, including the timely renewal thereof, in each
case in all material respects;

  

(e) use its Commercially Reasonable Efforts to preserve its
relationships with Customers in accordance with the Customer Agreements, and
perform in all material respects all of its obligations thereunder, according
to the terms and conditions thereof;

  

(f) comply in all material respects with all Laws;

  

(g) maintain in accordance with past practice the Books and Records
related to the Purchased Assets; and

  

(h) (i) adhere to current practice with respect to bad debt of the
Seller Business, collection of accounts and deactivation of delinquent account
service; and (ii) collect Accounts Receivable only in the ordinary course
consistent with past practices.

  

Section 5.7. _Negative Covenants_

  

With respect to the Purchased Assets, during the period from the date hereof
until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this Agreement, except
as required by Law or as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, Seller
shall not take, and shall cause each Seller Entity not to take, any of the
following actions relating to the Purchased Assets or the Seller Business
without the prior written consent of Purchaser:

  

(a) Sell, assign, transfer, convey or similarly dispose of any
Purchased Assets;

  

(b) enter into any contracts with any Affiliate of Seller which will
be binding upon Purchaser after Closing;   

  

  

  



    

  

  



  

(c) fail to pay when due any liability or obligations that, if
unpaid, would become a Lien upon any of the Purchased Assets;

  

(d) with the exception of any changes required by Law, implement any
material change in the terms and conditions of any Customer Agreements; or

  

(e) authorize or enter into an agreement in contravention of any of
the foregoing.

  

Section 5.8. _Risk of Loss_

  

Risk of loss with respect to the Purchased Assets shall not pass to Purchaser
until Closing has occurred.

  

Section 5.9. _Tax Matters_

  

(a) At Closing or, if due thereafter, promptly when due, any
documentary, stamp, sales, use, excise, transfer or other similar Taxes
arising out of or imposed upon the Transactions, other than income taxes and
franchise taxes (" _Transaction Taxes_ "), will be paid one-half by Seller and
one-half by Purchaser, regardless of the party on which the Transaction Tax is
assessed under applicable law. The parties agree to cooperate with each other
to take advantage of all applicable Transaction Tax exemptions and provide all
documentation and information reasonably necessary to obtain such exemptions.

  

(b) In the case of any Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets and the
business in which the Purchased Assets have been used that are attributable to
taxable periods beginning on or before and ending after the Closing Date (the
" _Straddle Period_ "), the amount of (A) personal, real and intangible
property Taxes for the pre-Closing period shall be equal to the amount of such
property Taxes attributable to the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days during the Straddle
Period that are in the pre-Closing period and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (B) Taxes (other than
property Taxes) for the pre-Closing period shall be computed as if such period
ended on the Closing Date. Any such Taxes allocated to the period up to and
including the Closing Date, to the extent such Taxes remain unpaid as of the
Closing Date shall be paid by Seller when and as due. Any such Taxes
allocated to the post-Closing period shall be paid by Purchaser when and as
due. To the extent either Party pays any Straddle Period Taxes that are the
responsibility of the other party pursuant to this paragraph, the non-paying
party will promptly reimburse the paying party for its share of such Taxes.

  

(c) Seller will prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for
taxable periods that end on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing
Periods_ ") related to the Purchased Assets or the business in which the
Purchased Assets have been used. Except as otherwise provided in the Customer
Transition Services Agreement or Network Transition Services Agreement,
Purchaser, in cooperation with Seller, will prepare for Straddle Periods or
cause to be prepared for Straddle Periods all Tax Returns related to the
Purchased Assets or the business in which the Purchased Assets have been used.
Any Tax Return for a Straddle Period will be prepared using the closing of the
books method to the extent permitted by applicable Law. Seller will pay all
Taxes shown as due on (A) any Tax Return relating solely to a Pre-Closing
Period and (B) any Tax Return for a Straddle Period to the extent properly
allocable to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period. Solely with
respect to the Purchased Assets operated by, or for the benefit of, the
Purchaser, Purchaser will pay all Taxes shown as due on (A) any Tax Returns
relating solely to a post-Closing period and (B) any Tax Return for a Straddle
Period to the extent properly allocable to the post-Closing portion of the
Straddle Period. All Tax Returns will be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice unless the past practice has been finally determined by the
applicable Governmental Authority to be incorrect or unless a contrary
treatment is required by applicable Law or the judicial or administrative
interpretation thereof.

  

(d) After the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser shall (and cause
their respective Affiliates to): (i) reasonably assist the other party in
preparing any Tax Returns related to the Purchased Assets which such other
party is responsible for preparing and filing; (ii) reasonably cooperate in
preparing for any audits of, or disputes with taxing authorities regarding,
any Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets; (iii) make available to the other
party and to any taxing authority as reasonably requested all information,
records, and documents relating to Taxes relating to the Purchased Assets;
(iv) provide timely notice to the other in writing of any pending or
threatened Tax audits or assessments relating to the Purchased Assets for
taxable periods for which the other may have a liability; and (v) furnish the
other with copies of all correspondence received from any taxing authority in
connection with any Tax audit, inquiry or information request with respect to
any taxable period for which the other may have a liability. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, to the extent that either party incurs significant expenses or
expends significant resources in providing such assistance and cooperation to
the other party, the party requesting or benefiting from such assistance and
cooperation shall be required to reasonably compensate the other party
therefor, but only to the extent that an established amount was agreed upon by
the parties prior to the performance of such services or such expenses being
incurred.

  

       

  

  



  

Section 5.10. _Post-Execution Contracts_

  

In the event that, following the date hereof and prior to Closing, Seller
enters into a contract or other agreement material to the operation of the
Seller Business (in each case, a " _Post-Execution Contract_ "), Seller shall
immediately provide Purchaser with a fully executed copy of such Post-
Execution Contract whereupon Purchaser may, in its reasonable discretion,
designate in writing such Post-Execution Contract to be included in the
Purchased Assets. In the event Purchaser does not so designate such Post-
Execution Contract as a Purchased Asset, it shall be deemed an Excluded Asset
for all purposes of this Agreement.

  

Section 5.11. _Certain FCC Requirements_

  

Seller has satisfied, or caused to be satisfied, the ten-year minimum buildout
requirement under 47 C.F.R. 24.203. Pursuant to 47 C.F.R. 24.714(e)(ii),

"substantial service" as set forth in 47 C.F.R. 24.16(a) for the partitioned
service areas it will acquire.

  

Section 5.12. _Non-Competition _

Seller nor any subsidiary thereof shall, directly or indirectly, either for
itself or any other Person, own, manage, operate, control, or participate in
the ownership, management, operation (including marketing, advertising and
sales) or control of, any Person engaged in a Competing Business, including,
without limitation, as a mobile virtual network operator; provided, however,
that (a) nothing set forth in this Section 5.12 shall prohibit Seller or any
subsidiary thereof from owning 10 percent or a lesser percentage in the
aggregate of the equity of any entity that owns, manages, operates or controls
a Competing Business so long as (i) Seller or such subsidiary does not direct
or cause the direction of the management and policies of such entity, and (ii)
Seller or such subsidiary does not use or allow the use, directly or
indirectly, of any trade name, trademark or service mark of Seller or any
subsidiary thereof in the operation of the Competing Business of such entity;
and (b) this Section 5.12 shall no longer apply to Seller or any subsidiary
thereof in the event that, following the Closing, a Person acquires Seller or
such subsidiary through (i) an acquisition of all of the equity interests of
Seller or such subsidiary, (ii) an acquisition of substantially all of the
assets of Seller or such subsidiary, or (iii) through a merger with Seller or
such subsidiary.

  

Except as provided in paragraphs 1 and 2 of _Schedule 5.12_ , for a period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the three (3) year anniversary of
the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any subsidiary thereof shall (a) assign
to any of their Affiliates (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary of Seller)
any authorizations from the FCC to provide wireless communications services in
the Seller Service Area, or (b) except to the extent permitted by clause (b)
of the preceding paragraph of this Section 5.12, permit any Person to use,
either directly or indirectly, any trade name, trademark or service mark of
Seller or any subsidiary thereof in the Seller Service Area.

  

For purposes of this Section 5.12, a "Competing Business" shall mean a system
or business that provides Commercial Mobile Radio Services, as defined under
47 C.F.R. 20.9, in the Seller Service Area.

  

Section 5.13. _WARN Act_

  

Seller shall comply and cause compliance with the provisions of the WARN Act
and any other similar state, or local Laws regarding "plant closings" or "mass
layoffs," with respect to any employment loss (as defined in the WARN Act) to
employees employed in operating the Seller Business.

  

Section 5.14. _Post-Execution Assessment of Enterprise Customer
Agreements_

  

(a) Seller shall, no later than 30 days from the date hereof,
provide, or cause to be provided, to Purchaser a _Schedule 5.14(a)_ that shall
set forth a list of each Enterprise Customer Agreement, and that shall
indicate which of such Enterprise Customer Agreements provide for (i) a
monthly service charge that is less than 80 percent of the Seller's standard
monthly service charge for the service plan provided pursuant to each such
Enterprise Customer Agreement or (ii) a custom (or in-building) network
solution. For purposes of this Section 5.14 only, "Enterprise Customer
Agreement" means Seller's "standard form of business customer agreement"
attached as _Schedule 4.12(a)(ii)_ or "a customized business customer
agreement" to which Seller is a party.

  

(b) Purchaser shall, no later than 30 days from the date of
Purchaser's receipt of _Schedule 5.14(a)_ , provide written notice to Seller
of the Enterprise Customer Agreements listed on _Schedule 5.14(a)_ that
Purchaser would like to receive from Seller and review. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with copies of the Enterprise Customer Agreements requested from
Seller pursuant to the preceding sentence within 30 days of Seller's receipt
of Purchaser's written notice.

  

       

  

  



  

(c) At any time prior to the date 30 days prior to Closing,
Purchaser shall have the right to provide to Seller a _Schedule 5.14(b)_ that
sets forth one or more Enterprise Customer Agreements. Purchaser and Seller
hereby agree that any Enterprise Customer Agreement identified on _Schedule
5.14(b)_ shall thereafter be deemed an Excluded Asset and an Excluded
Liability, rather than a Purchased Asset.

  

(d) Until the day following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not
provide, or cause to be provided, to its employees, or employees of its
Affiliates, that are directly involved in the sales or marketing of wireless
communications services in the Seller Service Area (" _Purchaser Sales and
Marketing Employees_ ") any of the information included in _Schedule 5.14(a)_
or written or electronic copies of such Schedule or the information included
therein. Purchaser shall take, or cause to be taken, appropriate or necessary
actions to assure that Purchaser Sales and Marketing Employees do not have
access to _Schedule 5.14(a)_ or the information included therein.

  

Section 5.15. _Seller Consents_.

  

Seller shall use Commercially Reasonably Efforts to obtain prior to the
Closing the Seller Consents, and provide Purchaser with copies of the same.
In the event that Seller fails to obtain any such Seller Consent, Purchaser
may elect to treat the underlying Customer Agreement as an Excluded Asset for
all purposes of this Agreement.

to be executed and delivered in connection with the Closing shall have been
executed by the Purchaser party thereto and delivered to Seller.

  

Section 6.3. _Frustration of Closing Conditions_ 

  

Neither Seller nor Purchaser may rely on the failure of any condition set

ARTICLE 7 _ 
INDEMNIFICATION_

  

Section 7.1. _Survival _

  

(a) All of the representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement, and in the certificates delivered pursuant to
Sections 6.1(a) and 6.2(a), shall survive the Closing Date and continue in
full force and effect for 18 months thereafter, except that the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.2, 3.3, 4.2, 4.3, 4.8,
and 4.9 shall survive the Closing Date and continue in full force and effect
until the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to such
section.

  

(b) All indemnification obligations under this Agreement shall
terminate as of the expiration of the survival period set forth in Section

and not resolved prior to such expiration, but any such extension shall apply
only as to such claims expressly made in writing prior to such expiration.

  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 9.12,

Indemnitee, respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses from claims for
breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability, or
otherwise) that it may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a
result of, or in connection with, any breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement by Purchaser or Seller, respectively, or any failure by
Purchaser or Seller, respectively, to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement set forth herein and otherwise relating to the Purchased Assets, the
Seller Business and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, that nothing in this Article 7 will preclude any party from seeking
any legal remedy available to such party for any breach or other conduct that
constitutes fraud on the part of any other party.

  

(d) The right to indemnification, payment of Losses or other remedy
based on such representations, warranties, covenants, and obligations will not
be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any Knowledge
acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any time, whether before or after
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect
to the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation,
warranty, covenant, or obligation.

Seller Material Adverse Effect;

  

       

  

  



  

(b) any breach of any agreement or covenant on the part of any Seller

Section 7.4. _Limitations on Liability for Losses_ 

  

(a) In no event shall any party hereto be liable for indirect,
incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, lost profits or
similar items (including loss of revenue, income or profits, or loss of
business reputation or opportunity relating to a breach or alleged breach
hereof), regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, warranty,
strict liability or tort, including negligence of any kind, whether active or
passive, and regardless of whether the other party knew of or was advised at
the time of breach of the possibility of such damages, except where such
damages are claimed by a third party pursuant to Sections 7.2(c), 7.2(d) or
7.2(e), or Sections 7.3(c) or 7.3(d), as applicable.

  

(b) No indemnification under Section 7.2(a) for any Losses suffered
by the Purchaser Indemnitees shall be required to be made by Seller until the
aggregate amount of the Losses suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds
$7,500,000 (the " _Threshold_ "), but once such Threshold is reached, then
indemnification shall be required to be made by Seller for all such Losses,
but subject to the other provisions of this Section 7.4; provided that the
foregoing limitation shall not apply to (i) any intentional breach of a
representation or warranty or (ii) any Losses in connection with Taxes
(including excise and penalty Taxes).

  

(c) No indemnification under Section 7.3(a) for any Losses suffered
by the Seller Indemnitees shall be required to be made by Purchaser until the
aggregate amount of the Losses suffered by the Seller Indemnitees exceeds the
Threshold, but once such Threshold is reached, then indemnification shall be
required to be made by Purchaser for all such Losses, but subject to the other
provisions of this Section 7.4; provided that the foregoing limitation shall
not apply to (i) any intentional breach of a representation or warranty or
(ii) any Losses in connection with Taxes (including excise and penalty Taxes).

  

(d) The maximum amount of Losses for which a party may be obligated
to provide indemnification with respect to any breach of a representation or
warranty shall be $100,000,000 in the aggregate; provided that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply to (i) any intentional breach of a representation
or warranty or (ii) any Losses in connection with Taxes (including excise and
penalty Taxes).

  

       

  

  



  

(e) Seller shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to Section
7.2(a) or (c) arising from a Seller Material Adverse Effect, but only if
Seller discloses to Purchaser such Seller Material Adverse Effect in writing
promptly after Seller becomes aware of such Seller Material Adverse Effect,
and Purchaser waives such Seller Material Adverse Effect in writing and
consummates the Closing; provided, that the foregoing limitation shall not
apply to any intentional breach of a representation or warranty made by Seller
on the date hereof.

  

(f) Purchaser shall not be liable for any Losses pursuant to Section
7.3(a) or (c) arising from a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect, but only if
Purchaser discloses to Seller such Purchaser Material Adverse Effect in
writing promptly after Purchaser becomes aware of such Purchaser Material
Adverse Effect, and Seller waives such Purchaser Material Adverse Effect in
writing and consummates the Closing; provided, that the foregoing limitation
shall not apply to any intentional breach of a representation or warranty made
by Purchaser on the date hereof.

  

(g) (i) With respect to each indemnification
obligation contained in any Transaction Document or any other document
executed in connection with the Closing, all Losses shall be net of any third-
party insurance proceeds that have been recovered or are recoverable by the
Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification, and (ii) Seller shall have no liability to indemnify any
Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses caused by or resulting from any
action (A) that Seller is required or requested to take pursuant to this
Agreement (including with the consent of Purchaser) or (B) that Seller, having
sought Purchaser's consent pursuant to this Agreement, did not take as a
result of Purchaser having withheld or delayed the requested consent.

  

(ii) If an Indemnitor makes any payment for any Losses suffered or
incurred by an Indemnified Party, such Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnified Party to
any insurance benefits or other claims of the Indemnified Party with respect
to such Losses and with respect to the claim giving rise to such Losses.

  

(iii) Each of the parties shall, and shall cause its applicable
Affiliates and Representatives to, take all reasonable steps to mitigate their
respective Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder.

  

Section 7.5. _Notice of Claims_

  

Any party (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") seeking indemnification under this
Article 7 shall give to the party obligated to provide indemnification to such
Indemnified Party (the " _Indemnitor_ ") a written notice (a " _Claim Notice_
") describing in reasonable detail the facts giving rise to any claim for
indemnification hereunder (a " _Claim_ "), including a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party (such
claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ ") and shall include in such Claim Notice
(if then known) the amount, or the method of computation of the amount, of
such Claim and a reference to the provision of this Agreement or any
agreement, document or instrument executed pursuant hereto or in connection
herewith upon which such Claim is based; provided, that a Claim Notice in
respect of any action at law or suit in equity by or against a third party as
to which indemnification will be sought must be given promptly after the
action or suit is commenced; provided, further that if such Claim Notice is
given prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, failure to
promptly give such Claim Notice shall not relieve the Indemnitor of its
obligations hereunder except to the extent it shall have been materially
prejudiced by such failure, it being understood that notices for claims in
respect of a breach of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must
be delivered prior to the expiration of any applicable survival period
provided for in Section 7.1(a) for such representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement.

  

Section 7.6. _Third Party Claims_

  

(a) The Indemnitor shall be authorized to consent to a settlement
of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without
the consent of any Indemnitee; provided, that the Indemnitor shall (i) pay or
cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment
concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii) not encumber any
of the material assets of any Indemnitee or agree to any restriction or
condition that would apply to or materially adversely affect any Indemnitee or
the conduct of any Indemnitee's business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of
any settlement or other resolution, a complete discharge and release of any
Indemnitee potentially affected by such Third Party Claim. Upon receipt of a
Claim Notice for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 7.5,
with respect to any Third Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall give
the Indemnitor a reasonable opportunity (i) to conduct any proceedings or
negotiations in connection therewith and necessary or appropriate to defend
the Indemnified Party, (ii) to employ counsel to contest any such claim,
action or suit in the name of the Indemnified Party or otherwise and (iii) to
take all other required steps or proceedings to settle or defend any such
claim, action or suit.

  

       

  

  



  

  (b) The expenses of all proceedings, contests or lawsuits with
respect to any claims, actions or suits for which a Claim is made shall be
borne by the Indemnitor. If the Indemnitor wishes to assume the defense of
any such claim, action or suit, then it shall   give written notice to the
Indemnified Party within 30 days after delivery of the Claim Notice, and the
Indemnitor shall thereafter assume the defense of any such claim, action or
suit, through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party;
provided, that the Indemnified Party shall have a reasonable opportunity to
participate in such defense at its own expense; provided, further that the
Indemnitor may settle or compromise such claim, action or suit without the
Indemnified Party's prior written consent only in accordance with the first
sentence of Section 7.6(a). The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
control the defense of the claim, action or suit if the Indemnitor does not
elect to assume the defense of such claim, action or suit by written notice as
set forth above; provided, that the Indemnitor shall have a reasonable
opportunity to participate in such defense at its own expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if (i) the defendants in any action shall
include both an Indemnitor and an Indemnified Party, and (ii) such Indemnified
Party shall have reasonably concluded that counsel selected by Indemnitor has
a material conflict of interest because of the availability of different or
additional defenses to such Indemnified Party, and (iii) either (A) counsel
shall have advised Indemnified Party that the conflict of interest cannot be
resolved by the consent of Indemnitor and Indemnified Party to the joint
representation, or (B) Indemnitor or Indemnified Party shall fail to give any
required consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
then such Indemnified Party shall have the right to select separate counsel to
participate in the defense of such action on its behalf, at the reasonable
expense of the Indemnitor.

  

(c) If the Indemnitor does not assume the defense of such claim,
action or suit by written notice as set forth in (b) above, then the
Indemnified Party may defend such claim, action or suit in such manner as the
Indemnified Party may deem appropriate (provided that the Indemnitor may
participate in such defense at its own expense).

Anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, this
Agreement may be terminated:

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the parties;

  

(b) by either party (provided that such party is not otherwise in
material breach) if the other party has breached a representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement set forth herein, and such breach could reasonably be
expected to have a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect (in the case of a breach
by Purchaser) or a Seller Material Adverse Effect (in the case of a breach by
Seller), and the breaching party fails to cure such breach within thirty (30)
days of written notice thereof;

  

(c) by either party upon written notice to the other party, upon the
other party's filing, or the other party having filed against it and remaining
pending for more than thirty (30) days, a petition under Title 11 of the
United States Code or similar state law provision seeking protection from
creditors or the appointment of a trustee, receiver or debtor in possession;

  

(d) by either party upon written notice to the other party if a court
of competent jurisdiction or Governmental Authority shall have issued an
order, decree or ruling permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Transactions, and such order, decree, ruling or other action
shall have become final and non-appealable; or

  

(e) by either party upon written notice to the other party if the
Closing shall not have occurred on or before the 18th month anniversary of the
date hereof.

other Person, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained in this Agreement, but such waiver of compliance with such
agreements or conditions shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the
party granting such extension or waiver. Neither the waiver by any of the
parties hereto of a breach of or a default under any of the provisions of this
Agreement, nor the failure by any of the parties, on one or more occasions, to
enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any right or
privilege hereunder, shall be construed as a waiver of any other breach or
default of a similar nature, or as a waiver of any of such provisions, rights
or privileges hereunder.

party in any such action or proceeding shall be effective if notice, including
the original or a copy of such process, is given and receipt thereof evidenced

(b) Purchaser may without Seller's consent assign its rights
hereunder to receive all or any portion of the Seller Assigned Licenses and

amendment or waiver is in writing and signed (in the case of an amendment) by
both parties or (in the case of a waiver) by the party granting the waiver.
No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, remedy, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or

Each term or provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner
as to be effective and valid under applicable Law, but in case any one or more
of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such provision shall be
ineffective to the extent but only to the extent of such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability, without rendering invalid or unenforceable the
remainder of such provision or provisions of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if the removal of such offending provision materially alters the
burdens or benefits of either of the parties under this Agreement, the parties
agree to negotiate in good faith such modifications to this Agreement, if any,
as are appropriate to ensure that the burdens and benefits of each party under
such modified agreement are reasonably comparable to the burdens and benefits
originally contemplated herein.

  

Section 9.8. _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_

  

With the exception of the parties to this Agreement and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, there shall exist no right of any person to
claim a beneficial interest in this Agreement or any rights arising out of
this Agreement.

  

Section 9.9. _Remedies Cumulative_

  

Except as otherwise provided herein, all rights, powers and remedies provided
under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in
equity shall be cumulative and not alternative, and the exercise or beginning
of the exercise of any right, power or remedy by a party shall not preclude
the simultaneous or later exercise of any other such right, power or remedy by
such party.

  

Section 9.10. _Expenses _

  

Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, whether or not the
Transactions are consummated, the parties shall bear their own expenses

Section 9.11. _Counterparts _

  

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, which may be

Section 9.12. _Specific Performance_

  

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement is not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or any covenant set forth in this Agreement is otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to enforce specifically the performance of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms and provisions and to prevent breaches
of covenants set forth in this Agreement. The foregoing right is in addition
to, and not in lieu of, any other rights a party hereto may have in respect of
a breach of this Agreement, whether at law or in equity.

  

Section 9.13. _Further Assurances_

  

At and following Closing, Seller shall execute and deliver to Purchaser, or

Purchased Assets, including the Seller Assigned Licenses.

  

Section 9.14. _Retention of Assets Prior to Closing_

  

Notwithstanding any other term hereof, until Closing Seller shall retain

control or direct Seller's exercise of ultimate authority over the Purchased
Assets.

  

Section 9.15. _Reformation _

take action to challenge the enforceability of this Agreement, or (c) take any
other steps whatsoever, on its own initiative or by petition from a third
party, to directly or indirectly challenge this Agreement or any provision
hereof, then the parties hereto shall promptly negotiate in good faith to
attempt to reform and amend this Agreement so as to eliminate or amend to make
unobjectionable any portion that is the subject of any FCC action, provided,
that neither party shall be obligated to reform or amend this Agreement under
the foregoing circumstances if any such amendment or modification, in the
reasonable judgment of such party, would not provide to or afford such party
substantially the same rights, duties and obligations such party has under
this Agreement as of the date hereof.
