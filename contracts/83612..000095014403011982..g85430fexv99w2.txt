         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I

            The Formation of Reynolds American, Sub and B&W Opco, the
           Asset Contribution, the Assumption of Liabilities, the B&W
                     Opco Stock Contribution and the Merger

         SECTION 1.01. The Formation of Reynolds American, Sub and B&W Opco. (a)
As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, B&W and RJR shall cause

Opco to be organized under the laws of the State of North Carolina. The Articles
of Incorporation and By-Laws of Reynolds American shall be in the form of

<PAGE>

                                                                               5

Agreement and shall effect the Asset Contribution and the Assumption of
Liabilities.

         SECTION 1.03. The B&W Opco Stock Contribution. (a) On the Closing Date,
immediately following the Asset Contribution and the Assumption of Liabilities
and simultaneously with the occurrence of the Effective Time, B&W shall
contribute, transfer and deliver to Reynolds American the B&W Opco Common Stock
in exchange for that number (rounded up to the nearest whole share) of fully
paid and nonassessable shares of Reynolds American Common Stock (the "Reynolds
American Stock Consideration") equal to the product of (i) 0.724138 (i.e., 42%
divided by 58%) and (ii) the RJR Share Calculation. The "RJR Share Calculation"
shall be equal to:

                  (A) the number of shares of RJR Common Stock issued and
         outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

                  plus

                  (B) the aggregate number of shares of RJR Common Stock that
         would be issued upon the exercise or settlement, as the case may be, of
         all RJR Stock Options (as defined in Section 6.04(d)), other
         equity-based or equity-related awards or other rights to receive or
         purchase RJR Common Stock outstanding or in existence immediately prior
         to the Effective Time (assuming exercise or settlement at that time),
         in each case that have a strike price or exercise price, if applicable,
         that is less than the 20-Day RJR Average Closing Price (as defined
         below) (the "In-the-Money Options");

                  less

                  (C) the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
         obtained by dividing (1) the aggregate proceeds that would be received
         by RJR upon exercise of all In-the-Money Options by (2) the 20-Day RJR
         Average Closing Price;

                  less

                  (D) the quotient (rounded up to the nearest whole number)
         obtained by dividing (1) the Option


<PAGE>

                                                                               6

         Withholding Amount by (2) the 20-Day RJR Average Closing Price;

The "Option Withholding Amount" means the product obtained by multiplying (x)
0.345 and (y)(1) the 20-Day RJR Average Closing Price multiplied by the
aggregate number of shares of RJR Common Stock that would be issued upon the
exercise of all In-the-Money Options less (2) the aggregate proceeds that would
be received by RJR upon exercise of all In-the-Money Options. The "20-Day RJR
Average Closing Price" means the average of the closing sales prices of RJR
Common Stock, as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. ("NYSE")
Composite Transactions Tape (as reported by The Wall Street Journal (Northeast
edition), or, if not reported thereby, as reported in another authoritative
source selected by B&W and RJR) on the NYSE trading day that is two NYSE trading
days prior to the Closing Date and on each of the 19 NYSE trading days prior to
such NYSE trading day. It is the understanding of the parties that, after giving
effect to the Transactions, B&W will own 42% of the outstanding Reynolds
American Common Stock (applying the treasury stock method described above). For
purposes of determining the RJR Share Calculation, any restricted stock or
equity awards of RJR that are taken into treasury, cancelled or cashed-out upon
the occurrence of the Effective Time will be deemed to have been cancelled or
cashed-out prior to determining the RJR Share Calculation. Any equity-based
awards (other than restricted or unrestricted stock) granted to RJR directors by
RJR on or after the date of this Agreement that remain outstanding as of the
Effective Time shall be deemed to be equal to the aggregate number of shares of
RJR Common Stock into which such equity units are exercisable, convertible or
exchangeable for purposes of determining the RJR Share Calculation, and such
number of shares of RJR Common Stock so determined shall be included in clause
(A) of the definition of the RJR Share Calculation.

         (b) At the time of the B&W Opco Stock Contribution, Reynolds American
shall deliver to B&W certificates, registered in the name of B&W, representing
the Reynolds American Stock Consideration.

         SECTION 1.04. The Merger. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General
Corporation Law (the "DGCL"), Sub shall be merged with and into RJR at the
Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate

corporate existence of Sub shall cease, and RJR shall continue as the surviving
corporation (the "Surviving Corporation"). The Asset Contribution, the
Assumption of Liabilities, the B&W Opco Stock Contribution, the Merger, the
Reynolds American Loan, the issuance by Reynolds American of the Reynolds
American Stock Consideration and the Reynolds American Common Stock in
connection with the Merger (the "Share Issuance") and the other transactions
contemplated by the Transaction Agreements are referred to in this Agreement
collectively as the "Transactions".

         SECTION 1.05. Closing. The closing (the "Closing") of the Transactions
shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, 825 Eighth
Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day
following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law (as defined in
Section 3.05(a)), waiver by all parties) of the conditions set forth in Section
7.01, or, if on such day any condition set forth in Section 7.02 or 7.03 has not
been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waived by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof), as soon as practicable after all the
conditions set forth in Article VII have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing
between B&W and RJR. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Closing Date".

         SECTION 1.06. Effective Time. Prior to the Closing, RJR shall prepare,
or RJR shall cause Reynolds American to prepare, and on the Closing Date RJR or
Reynolds American shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, a certificate of merger (in any such case, the "Certificate of
Merger") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL.
Reynolds American or the Surviving Corporation shall make all other filings or
recordings required under the DGCL as soon as practicable on or after the
Closing Date. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate
of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as
B&W and RJR shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the
Merger becomes effective being the "Effective Time").

         SECTION 1.07. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.

         SECTION 1.08. Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Surviving
Corporation. (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of RJR shall be amended to be
substantially in the form of the Certificate of Incorporation of Sub immediately

amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

         (b) The By-Laws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed

Governance Matters. The Board of Directors and the executive officers of

Exhibit H hereto until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until
their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be,
it being agreed that if any director shall be unable to serve as a director at
the Effective Time, then the party which designated such individual as indicated
in Exhibit H shall designate another individual to serve in such individual's
place.

of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
RJR Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:

         (a) Capital Stock of Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to
exist, and no Reynolds American Common Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Reynolds American
Common Stock that is owned by RJR or Sub at the Effective Time shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease
to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange
therefor.

         (c) Conversion of RJR Common Stock. Except as set forth in Section
2.01(b), each share of RJR Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive one (the
"Exchange Ratio") fully paid and nonassessable share of Reynolds American Common
Stock. The shares of Reynolds American Common Stock to be issued upon the
conversion of shares of RJR Common Stock pursuant to this Section 2.01(c) is
referred to as the "Merger Consideration". As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of RJR Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate representing any such shares of RJR Common Stock shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive Merger
Consideration and certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.02(c), in each case upon surrender of such certificate in accordance
with Section 2.02, without interest.

         SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates. (a) Exchange Agent. Promptly
following the Effective Time, Reynolds American shall deposit with a bank or

this Article II, through the Exchange Agent, certificates representing the
shares of Reynolds American Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 as a
result of the Merger and upon surrender of Certificates. From time to time as
necessary following the Effective Time, Reynolds American shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Certificates, the amount of
cash necessary to pay dividends and other distributions in accordance with
Section 2.02(c).

immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of RJR
Common Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01 (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as B&W and RJR
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancelation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing
that number of whole shares of Reynolds American Common Stock pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II and certain dividends and other distributions in
respect of Reynolds American Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.03(c),
and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of
a transfer of ownership of RJR Common Stock that is not registered in the
transfer records of RJR, a certificate representing the appropriate number of
shares of Reynolds American Common Stock may be issued and the proper amount of
cash paid to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so
surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer, and the person requesting such
issuance and payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
the issuance of shares of Reynolds American Common Stock and payment of cash to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to
the satisfaction of Reynolds American that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this Section 2.02 and certain dividends and other distributions
in respect of Reynolds American Common Stock in accordance

                                                                              11

with Section 2.03(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash payable
upon surrender of any Certificate.

         (c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or
other distributions with respect to Reynolds American Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Reynolds American Common Stock
issuable upon surrender thereof. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender
of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the
certificate representing whole shares of Reynolds American Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of
Reynolds American Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Reynolds American Common
Stock.

         (d) No Further Ownership Rights in RJR Common Stock. The Reynolds
American Common Stock issued and any cash paid upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed
to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
shares of RJR Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, subject,
however, to the Surviving Corporation's obligation to pay any dividends or make
any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by RJR on such shares of RJR Common Stock in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this
Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective
Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of RJR Common Stock that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II.

         (e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an

                                                                              12

affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting
by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation
may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Surviving Corporation will cause the Exchange
Agent to deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of RJR Common Stock
formerly represented thereby and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of
Reynolds American Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this
Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                      Representations and Warranties of RJR

         RJR represents and warrants to B&W that as of the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated the date of this
Agreement (with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which the information set forth in such disclosure letter
relates; provided, however, that any information set forth in one section of
such disclosure letter shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or
subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is readily apparent)
delivered by RJR to B&W prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "RJR
Disclosure Letter"):

         SECTION 3.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of RJR and each
subsidiary (as defined in Section 9.03) of RJR (each, a "RJR Subsidiary") is
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is organized and has full corporate power and authority
and possesses all governmental franchises, licenses, permits and authorizations
(collectively, "Permits") and approvals necessary to enable it to own, lease or
otherwise hold its properties and assets and to conduct its businesses as
presently conducted, other than such Permits and approvals the lack of which,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to
have a RJR Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.03). RJR and each
RJR Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the
nature of its business or the


<PAGE>

                                                                              13

ownership or leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other
than jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. RJR has made available
to B&W true and complete copies of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of
RJR (the "RJR Charter") and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of RJR (the "RJR
By-Laws"), and the comparable charter and organizational documents of each RJR
Subsidiary, in each case as amended through the date of this Agreement.

         SECTION 3.02. RJR Subsidiaries; Equity Interests. (a) Section 3.02 of
the RJR Disclosure Letter lists as of the date of this Agreement each RJR
Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity, voting or ownership interests in, each RJR
Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are
owned by RJR, by a RJR Subsidiary or by RJR and another RJR Subsidiary, free and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, mortgages, encumbrances and
security interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, "Liens").

         (b) Except for the capital stock of, or other equity, voting or
ownership interests in, the RJR Subsidiaries, RJR does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint
venture interest or other equity interest in any person.

         SECTION 3.03. Capital Structure. The authorized capital stock of RJR
consists of 290,000,000 shares of RJR Common Stock and 50,000,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "RJR Preferred Stock" and,
together with RJR Common Stock, the "RJR Capital Stock"), of which 2,000,000
shares are designated as Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock (the
"Series A Preferred Stock"). At the close of business on October 24, 2003, (i)
84,630,925 shares of RJR Common Stock, excluding treasury shares (including
1,071,012 restricted shares that are subject to a right of repurchase by, or
forfeiture to, RJR ("RJR Restricted Shares")) were outstanding, none of which
were held by any RJR Subsidiary, (ii) 31,256,949 shares of RJR Common Stock were
held by RJR in its treasury, (iii) 2,544,479 shares of RJR Common Stock were
subject to outstanding RJR Stock Options, with a weighted average exercise price
of $29.23 per share, and 5,925,480 additional shares of RJR Common Stock were

                                                                              14

reserved and available for issuance pursuant to RJR Stock Plans (as defined in
Section 6.04(d)) in accordance with the present terms of such plans, (iv)
2,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock were reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of the rights (the "RJR Rights") issued pursuant to the Rights
Agreement dated as of May 17, 1999 (as amended from time to time prior to the
date of this Agreement, the "RJR Rights Agreement"), between RJR and The Bank of
New York, as Rights Agent, and (v) no shares of RJR Preferred Stock were issued
and outstanding or held by RJR in its treasury. Except as set forth above, at
the close of business on October 24, 2003, no shares of capital stock of, or
other equity, voting or ownership interests in, RJR were issued, reserved for
issuance or outstanding. Section 3.03(a) of the RJR Disclosure Letter sets forth
a true and complete list, as of the close of business on October 24, 2003, of
(a) all outstanding RJR Stock Options and all other rights, if any, to purchase
or receive RJR Common Stock under RJR Stock Plans or otherwise, the number of
shares of RJR Common Stock subject to each RJR Stock Option or other purchase
right, the grant dates and exercise prices and vesting schedule of each such RJR
Stock Option or other purchase right and the names of the holders, (b) all RJR
Restricted Shares, the date any repurchase or forfeiture right lapses for each
RJR Restricted Share, any repurchase price for any RJR Restricted Share and the
names of the holders thereof, (c) all outstanding RJR Cash Deferred Stock Units
(as defined in Section 6.04(d)), the grant dates and names of the holders
thereof, (d) all outstanding RJR Stock Deferred Stock Units (as defined in
Section 6.04(d)), the grant dates and the names of the holders thereof, (e) all
outstanding RJR SARs (as defined in Section 6.04(d)), the grant dates and base
values and vesting schedules of each such RJR SAR and the names and holders
thereof and (f) all outstanding RJR Director Deferrals (as defined in Section
6.04(d)), the dates of deferral and the names of the account holders thereof.
Other than the RJR Stock Options, the RJR Stock Deferred Stock Units and the RJR
Rights, there are no outstanding rights of any person to receive RJR Common
Stock, whether on a deferred basis or otherwise. Other than the RJR Cash
Deferred Stock Units, the RJR SARs, the RJR Stock Deferred Stock Units and the
RJR Director Deferrals, there are no outstanding stock appreciation rights
("SARs") or other outstanding rights (other than the RJR Rights) that are in any
way linked to the price of RJR Common Stock or the value of RJR or any part
thereof, whether or not granted in


<PAGE>

                                                                              15

tandem with a related RJR Stock Option. All outstanding shares of RJR Capital
Stock are, and all such shares that may be issued prior to the Effective Time
will be when issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and not subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option,
call option, right of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any
similar right under any provision of the DGCL, the RJR Charter, the RJR By-Laws
or any Contract (as defined in Section 3.05(a)) to which RJR is a party or
otherwise bound. There are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of RJR having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which
holders of RJR Capital Stock may vote ("RJR Voting Debt"). Except as set forth
above, there are no options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable
securities, other securities, "phantom" stock rights, SARs, stock-based
performance units, commitments, Contracts, arrangements or undertakings of any
kind to which RJR or any RJR Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is
bound (x) obligating RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to issue, grant, deliver or sell,
or cause to be issued, granted, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital
stock of or other equity, voting or ownership interests in, or any security
convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock of or
other equity, voting or ownership interest in, RJR or of any RJR Subsidiary or
any RJR Voting Debt, (y) obligating RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to issue, grant,
sell, extend or enter into any such option, warrant, call, right, security,
unit, commitment, Contract, arrangement or undertaking or (z) that give any
person the right to receive any economic benefit or right similar to or derived
from the economic benefits and rights accruing to holders of the capital stock
of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary. There are not any outstanding contractual
obligations of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to (i) repurchase, redeem or otherwise
acquire any shares of capital stock of, or other equity, voting or ownership
interests in, RJR or any RJR Subsidiary or (ii) vote or dispose of any shares of
capital stock of, or other equity, voting or ownership interest in, any of its
subsidiaries. RJR has made available to B&W a true and complete copy of the RJR
Rights Agreement, as amended through the date of this Agreement.

         During the period from October 24, 2003, to the date of this Agreement,
there have been no issuances by RJR of any shares of capital stock of, or other
equity, voting


<PAGE>

                                                                              16

or ownership interests in, RJR other than issuances of shares of RJR Common
Stock (and associated RJR Rights) pursuant to the exercise of RJR Stock Options
outstanding on the date of this Agreement in accordance with their terms or
awards pursuant to RJR Stock Plans that are required by their terms as in effect
on the date of this Agreement. To the knowledge of RJR, there are no irrevocable
proxies and no voting agreements with respect to any shares of the capital stock
or other voting securities of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary.

         SECTION 3.04. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. (a)
Each of RJR and each RJR Subsidiary has all requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver each Transaction Agreement to which it is or
will be a party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to
consummate the Transactions, subject, in the case of the Merger, to receipt of
the RJR Stockholder Approval (as defined in Section 3.04(c)). The execution and
delivery by each of RJR and each RJR Subsidiary of each Transaction Agreement to
which it is or will be a party, the performance by it of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by RJR and each RJR Subsidiary of
the Transactions have been or will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of RJR and each RJR Subsidiary, subject, in the case of the
Merger, to receipt of the RJR Stockholder Approval. Each of RJR and each RJR
Subsidiary has duly executed and delivered (or will duly execute and deliver on
or prior to the Closing Date) each Transaction Agreement to which it is or will
be a party, and each Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be a party
constitutes (or will constitute on or prior to the Closing Date) its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms.

         (b) The Board of Directors of RJR (the "RJR Board"), at a meeting duly
called and held at which all directors were present, duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the other Transaction
Agreements, the Merger and the other Transactions, (ii) determining that the
terms of the Merger and the other Transactions are fair to and in the best
interests of RJR and its stockholders, (iii) recommending that RJR's
stockholders adopt this Agreement and (iv) declaring that this Agreement is
advisable, which resolutions have not been subsequently rescinded, modified


<PAGE>

                                                                              17

or withdrawn in any way except as permitted by Section 5.02(b). Such resolutions
are sufficient to render the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL ("Section
203") inapplicable to B&W, Reynolds American, Sub and B&W Opco, this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger and the other Transactions. To
RJR's knowledge, no other state takeover statute or similar statute or
regulation applies or purports to apply to RJR with respect to this Agreement
and the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger or any other Transaction.

         (c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of RJR Capital
Stock necessary to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger is the
adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of RJR Common Stock (the "RJR Stockholder Approval"). The affirmative
vote of the holders of RJR Capital Stock, or any of them, is not necessary to
approve any Transaction Agreement other than this Agreement or consummate any
Transaction other than the Merger.

         SECTION 3.05. No Conflicts; Consents.

(a) The execution and delivery by each of RJR and each RJR Subsidiary of each
Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be a party and the performance by
it of its obligations hereunder and thereunder do not, and the consummation of
the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with
or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a
material benefit under, or to increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed
rights or entitlements of any person under, or result in the creation of any
Lien upon any of the properties or assets of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary under,
any provision of (i) the RJR Charter, the RJR By-Laws or the comparable charter
or organizational documents of any RJR Subsidiary, (ii) any material contract,
commitment, obligation, lease, license, indenture, note, debenture, bond,
guarantee, agreement, permit, concession, franchise or other instrument (a
"Contract") to which RJR or any RJR Subsidiary is a party or by which any of
their respective properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings
and other matters referred to in Section 3.05(b), any judgment, order or decree
("Judgment") or statute, law, ordinance, rule or regulation ("Law") applicable
to RJR or


<PAGE>

                                                                              18

any RJR Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the
case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually or in
the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material
Adverse Effect.

         (b) No consent, approval, license, Permit, order or authorization
("Consent") of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or Permit from, any
domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state, provincial, local or
otherwise) government or any court of competent jurisdiction, administrative
agency or commission or other governmental authority or instrumentality,
domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), is required to be obtained or
made by or with respect to RJR or any RJR Subsidiary in connection with the
execution, delivery and performance by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary of any
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the
Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR
Act"), (ii) any required approval of the Transactions by the European Commission
pursuant to Council Regulation No. 4064189 of the European Community, as amended
(the "EC Merger Regulation"), (iii) any required approvals or filings under the
antitrust laws of member states of the European Union, (iv) the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") of (A) a proxy statement relating
to the adoption of this Agreement by RJR's stockholders (as amended or
supplemented from time to time, the "Proxy Statement"), (B) a registration
statement on Form S-4 to be filed with the SEC by Reynolds American in
connection with the Share Issuance (as amended or supplemented from time to
time, the "Form S-4"), (C) a registration statement on Form 8-A under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), in connection
with the Share Issuance (the "Form 8-A") and (D) such reports under Section 13
and Section 16 of the Exchange Act as may be required in connection with this
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (v) any filings required in connection with the Tax Rulings (as
defined in Section 6.13(a)), (vi) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with
the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions in which RJR is qualified to
do business, (vii) the filing of Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State
of the


<PAGE>

                                                                              19

States of North Carolina and New Jersey for the merger of RJR-T with B&W Opco
and appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other
jurisdictions in which RJR-T is qualified to do business, (viii) such filings
with and approvals of the NYSE as are required to permit the shares of Reynolds
American Common Stock that are to be issued in the Share Issuance to be listed
on the NYSE, (ix) such filings with and approvals of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, state licensing authorities and state taxing
authorities as are required to consummate the Transactions, (x) compliance with
any such filings as may be required under applicable Environmental Law (as
defined in Section 9.03), (xi) such filings as may be required in connection
with the taxes described in Section 6.09 and (xii) such other items that the
failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in the aggregate, are not
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) RJR and the RJR Board have taken all action necessary to (i) render
the RJR Rights inapplicable to this Agreement, the other Transaction Agreements,
the Merger and the other Transactions and (ii) ensure that (A) neither B&W nor
any of its affiliates or associates is or will become an "Acquiring Person" (as
defined in the RJR Rights Agreement) by reason of or as a result of the
approval, execution, delivery or adoption of any Transaction Agreement or the
approval, adoption or consummation of the Merger or any other Transaction, (B)
none of a "Distribution Date", "Triggering Event", "Section 11(a)(ii) Event",
"Section 13 Event" or "Stock Acquisition Date" (in each case as defined in the
RJR Rights Agreement) shall occur by reason of or as a result of the approval,
execution, delivery or adoption of any Transaction Agreement or the approval,
adoption or consummation of the Merger or any other Transaction and (C) the RJR
Rights shall expire immediately prior to the Effective Time.

         SECTION 3.06. SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a) RJR has filed
all reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
filed with the SEC by RJR since January 1, 2003 (the documents referred to in
this Section 3.06(a) being referred to collectively as the "RJR SEC Documents").

         (b) As of its respective date, each RJR SEC Document complied as to
form in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act or the
Securities Act


<PAGE>

                                                                              20

of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such RJR SEC
Document, and did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. The consolidated financial statements of RJR included in
RJR SEC Documents comply as to form in all material respects with applicable
accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with
respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and fairly present in all material respects the consolidated financial position
of RJR and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown
(subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments). Each of the principal executive officer of RJR and the principal
financial officer of RJR (or each former principal executive officer of RJR and
each former principal financial officer of RJR, as applicable) has made all
certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") and the rules and regulations of the SEC
promulgated thereunder with respect to RJR SEC Documents. For purposes of the
preceding sentence, "principal executive officer" and "principal financial
officer" shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

         (c) Except as set forth in the RJR SEC Documents filed by RJR with the
SEC and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (the "Filed RJR
SEC Documents"), neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise
and other than liabilities or obligations of any nature arising out of any
Action relating to the development, packaging, labeling, delivery, sale, resale,
distribution, marketing, promotion, use or consumption of, or exposure to,
tobacco products, including smoking and health-related and safety-related
claims) that are required by GAAP to be set forth on a consolidated balance
sheet of RJR and its consolidated subsidiaries or


<PAGE>

                                                                              21

in the notes thereto and that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect.

         (d) None of the RJR Subsidiaries is, or has at any time since January
1, 2002, been, subject to the reporting requirements of Sections 13(a) and 15(d)
of the Exchange Act.

         SECTION 3.07. Disclosure Documents. (a) Each document required to be
filed by RJR or Reynolds American with the SEC or required to be distributed or
otherwise disseminated to RJR's stockholders in connection with the Merger and
the other Transactions, including the Proxy Statement and the Form S-4, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as
applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

         (b) (i) At the time the Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement
thereto is first mailed to the stockholders of RJR, and at the time such
stockholders vote on adoption of this Agreement, the Proxy Statement, as amended
or supplemented, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) at the time
the Form S-4 or any amendment or supplement thereto becomes effective, the Form
S-4, as amended or supplemented, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, except that no representation or warranty
is made by RJR in this Section 3.07 with respect to statements made or
incorporated by reference therein based on information supplied by B&W
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in such documents.

         SECTION 3.08. Absence of Certain Changes or Events. From December 31,
2002, until the date of this Agreement, (a) RJR has conducted its business in
the ordinary course consistent with past practice and (b) there has not been:

         (i) a RJR Material Adverse Effect;

         (ii) (A) any declaration, setting aside or payment of any dividend or

other acquisition for value by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary of any capital stock of
RJR or any RJR Subsidiary or any other securities thereof or any rights,
warrants or options to acquire any such shares or other securities;

         (iii) any split, combination or reclassification of any RJR Capital
Stock or any issuance or the authorization of any issuance of any other
securities in respect of, in lieu of or in substitution for shares of RJR
Capital Stock;

         (iv) any amendment of any material term of any outstanding security of
RJR or any RJR Subsidiary;

         (v) any incurrence, assumption or guarantee by RJR or any RJR
Subsidiary of any indebtedness for borrowed money in an aggregate principal
amount in excess of $10,000,000;

         (vi) (1) except in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice (I) any granting by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to any current or former
director, officer, employee or consultant of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary
(collectively, "RJR Personnel") of any bonus opportunity or any increase in
compensation or benefits or (II) any payment by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to any
RJR Personnel of any bonus, in each case, except to the extent required under
any employment agreement in effect on December 31, 2002, and in accordance with
its terms as of such date, (2) any granting by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to any

                                                                              23

Subsidiary into, or any amendment of, (I) any employment, deferred compensation,
severance, termination, employee benefit, loan, indemnification, stock
repurchase, consulting or similar agreement between RJR or any RJR Subsidiary,
on the one hand, and any RJR Personnel, on the other hand, or (II) any agreement
between RJR or any RJR Subsidiary, on the one hand, and any RJR Personnel, on
the other hand, the benefits of which are contingent, or the terms of which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving RJR of the
nature contemplated by this Agreement (all such agreements under this clause
(3), including any such agreement which is entered into on or after the date of
this Agreement, collectively, "RJR Benefit Agreements"), (4) any amendment of
any incentive award (including RJR Stock Options, stock appreciation rights,
performance units, restricted stock, stock repurchase rights or other
equity-based or equity-related awards) or any removal or modification of any
restrictions in any such award or (5) any amendment to, or material modification
of, any RJR Stock Plan;

         (vii) any change in financial reporting or accounting methods,
      principles or practices by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary materially affecting
      the consolidated assets, liabilities or results of operations of RJR,
      except insofar as may have been required by a change in GAAP;

         (viii) any material elections with respect to Taxes (as defined in
      Section 3.09(g)) by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary or settlement or compromise
      by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary of any material Tax liability or refund; or

         (ix) any sale, lease (as lessor), license or other disposition of, or
      the creation or existence of any Lien on, any properties or assets, except
      in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice.

         SECTION 3.09. Taxes. (a) RJR and each RJR Subsidiary and any
consolidated, combined, affiliated or unitary group of which RJR or any RJR
Subsidiary is or has ever been a member (each, a "RJR Affiliated Group") has
timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf, all Tax Returns
(as defined below) required to be


<PAGE>

                                                                              24

filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true, complete and accurate, except to
the extent any failure to file or any inaccuracies in any filed Tax Returns,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to
have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. All Taxes shown to be due on such Tax
Returns, or otherwise owed by RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any RJR Affiliated
Group, have been timely paid, except to the extent that any failure to pay,
individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to
have a RJR Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) The most recent financial statements contained in the Filed RJR SEC
Documents reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by RJR and the RJR
Subsidiaries (in addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect timing
differences between book and Tax items) for all taxable periods and portions
thereof through the date of such financial statements, except to the extent any
failure to make such a reserve, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and is not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. No
deficiency, audit examination, refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter
in controversy with respect to any Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed
against RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any RJR Affiliated Group, except to the
extent any such proposal, assertion or assessment, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material
Adverse Effect. No requests for waivers of the time to assess any Taxes of RJR,
any RJR Subsidiary or any RJR Affiliated Group are pending, and there is no
effective agreement or other document extending, or having the effect of
extending, the period of assessment or collection of any Taxes of RJR, any RJR
Subsidiary or any RJR Affiliated Group, except to the extent any such deficiency
or request for waiver, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect.

         (c) The Federal income Tax Returns of RJR and each RJR Subsidiary have
been examined by and settled with the United States Internal Revenue Service
("IRS"), or have closed by virtue of the expiration of the relevant statute of
limitations, for all years through 1982. All material assessments for Taxes due
and owing by RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any RJR Affiliated Group with respect to


<PAGE>

                                                                              25

completed and settled examinations or any concluded litigation have been fully
paid.

         (d) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes
not yet due and payable) on the assets of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary. Neither RJR
nor any RJR Subsidiary is bound by any agreement with respect to Taxes.

         (e) RJR and each RJR Subsidiary have complied with all applicable Laws
relating to the payment and withholding of Taxes (including withholding of Taxes
pursuant to Sections 1441, 1442, 3121 and 3402 of the Code and similar
provisions under any domestic or foreign (whether national, Federal, state,
provincial, local or otherwise)) and have, within the time and the manner
prescribed by Law, withheld from and paid over to the proper Governmental
Entities all amounts required to be so withheld and paid over under applicable
Laws.

         (f) Neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any
action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is
reasonably likely (i) to prevent the Asset Contribution and Assumption of
Liabilities, on the one hand, or the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the Merger,
on the other hand, from qualifying as an exchange within the meaning of Section
351 of the Code or (ii) to prevent the SF Contribution from qualifying as an
exchange within the meaning of Section 351 of the Code and also as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

         (g) For purposes of this Agreement:

         "Taxes" means all (i) domestic or foreign (whether national, Federal,
      state, provincial, local or otherwise) taxes, assessments, duties or
      similar charges of any kind whatsoever, including all corporate franchise,
      income, sales, use, ad valorem, receipts, value added, profits, license,
      withholding, payroll, employment, excise, property, net worth, capital
      gains, transfer, stamp, documentary, payroll, alternative minimum,
      recapture and other taxes, including any interest, fines, penalties and
      additions imposed with respect to such amounts; (ii) liability for the
      payment of any amounts of the type described in clause (i) as a result of
      being a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or


<PAGE>

                                                                              26

      aggregate group and (iii) liability for the payment of any amounts as a
      result of an express or implied obligation to indemnify any other person
      with respect to the payment of any amounts of the type described in clause
      (i) or (ii).

         "Tax Return" means all domestic or foreign (whether national, Federal,
      state, provincial, local or otherwise) Tax returns, declarations,
      statements, reports, schedules, forms and information returns and any
      amended Tax return relating to Taxes.

         SECTION 3.10. Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans. From December 31,
2002, through the date of this Agreement, there has not been (a) any
termination, adoption or amendment in any material respect or any agreement to
terminate, adopt or amend in any material respect, by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary
of any collective bargaining agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase,
stock appreciation, restricted stock, stock repurchase rights, stock option,
"phantom stock", performance, retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death
benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding
(whether or not legally binding and whether or not subject to the laws of the
United States) maintained or contributed to, or required to be maintained or
contributed to, by RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any other person that, together
with RJR, is treated as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o)
of the Code or any other applicable Law (each, a "RJR Commonly Controlled
Entity"), in each case, providing benefits to any RJR Personnel (all such plans,
arrangements or understandings, including any such plan, arrangement or
understanding which is entered into or adopted on or after the date of this
Agreement, collectively, "RJR Benefit Plans") or (b) any material change in the
manner in which contributions to any RJR Pension Plans (as defined in Section
3.11(a)) are made or the basis on which such contributions are determined.
Neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary is a party to any RJR Benefit Agreement.

         SECTION 3.11. ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments. (a) The RJR
Disclosure Letter contains a list of all "employee pension benefit plans" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,
as amended ("ERISA")) ("RJR Pension Plans"), "employee welfare benefit plans"
(as defined in


<PAGE>

                                                                              27

Section 3(1) of ERISA) ("RJR Welfare Plans") and all other RJR Benefit Plans
maintained or contributed to, or required to be maintained or contributed to, by
RJR or any RJR Subsidiary. Each RJR Benefit Plan has been administered in
compliance with its terms and applicable Law, except where the failure to be so
administered, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. RJR has made available
to B&W true, complete and correct copies of (i) each RJR Benefit Plan and RJR
Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any unwritten RJR Benefit Plan or RJR
Benefit Agreement, a description thereof), (ii) the most recent annual report on
Form 5500 filed with the IRS with respect to each RJR Benefit Plan for which
such annual report was required, (iii) the most recent summary plan description
for each RJR Benefit Plan for which such summary plan description is required,
(iv) the most recent actuarial valuation report for each RJR Benefit Plan for
which such actuarial valuation report was required or prepared and (v) each
trust agreement and group annuity contract relating to any RJR Benefit Plan.

         (b) All RJR Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified are so qualified
and have been the subject of determination letters from the IRS or other
Governmental Entity with respect to all Tax Law changes through and including
the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or have a
remaining period of time under applicable Law to amend such RJR Pension Plans to
comply with applicable Tax Law and to submit such amendment to the IRS for a
determination letter to the effect that such RJR Pension Plans are qualified and
exempt from United States Federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and no determination letter has been revoked (nor, to
the knowledge of RJR, has revocation been threatened). No event has occurred
since the date of the most recent determination letter or application therefor
relating to any such RJR Pension Plan that would adversely affect the
qualification of such RJR Pension Plan or increase the costs relating thereto or
require security under Section 307 of ERISA, except for events that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a RJR
Material Adverse Effect. All RJR Pension Plans required to have been approved by
any non-U.S. Governmental Entity have been so approved or timely submitted for
approval and no such approval has been revoked (nor, to the knowledge of RJR,
has revocation been


<PAGE>

                                                                              28

threatened). No event has occurred since the date of the most recent approval or
application therefor relating to any such RJR Pension Plan that would affect any
such approval relating thereto or increase the costs relating thereto, except
for events that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. RJR has made available to B&W a true,
complete and correct copy of the most recent determination or approval letter
received with respect to each RJR Pension Plan, as well as a true, complete and
correct copy of each pending application for a determination or approval letter,
if any.

         (c) No RJR Pension Plan, other than any RJR Pension Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "RJR
Multiemployer Pension Plan"), had, as of the respective last annual valuation
date for each such RJR Pension Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability" (as such
term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions
that have been furnished to B&W. No RJR Pension Plan has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code), whether or not waived, nor has any waiver of the minimum funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code been requested of
or granted by the IRS with respect to any RJR Pension Plan. With respect to each
RJR Benefit Plan, (i) there has not occurred any prohibited transaction in which
RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any of its or their respective employees or, to the
knowledge of RJR, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of any RJR
Benefit Plan or trust created thereunder has engaged that is reasonably likely
to subject RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any of its or their respective employees,
or, to the knowledge of RJR, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of
any RJR Benefit Plan or any trust created thereunder, to any Tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions
imposed under Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law of a magnitude that
would result in a RJR Material Adverse Effect and (ii) none of RJR, any RJR
Subsidiary or any of its or their respective employees, or, to the knowledge of
RJR, any trustee or other fiduciary of any RJR Benefit Plan or any trust created
thereunder, has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner that is
reasonably likely to, or failed to act in a manner that is reasonably likely to,
subject RJR, any RJR Subsidiary, or,


<PAGE>

                                                                              29

to the knowledge of RJR, any trustee or other fiduciary of any RJR Benefit Plan
or any trust created thereunder, to any liability for breach of fiduciary duty
under ERISA or any other applicable Law of a magnitude that would result in a
RJR Material Adverse Effect. No RJR Benefit Plan or trust has been terminated,
nor has there been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section
4043 of ERISA) with respect to any RJR Benefit Plan during the last five years.
Neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a
"partial withdrawal" (as such terms are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205,
respectively, of ERISA) since the effective date of such Sections 4203 and 4205
with respect to any RJR Multiemployer Pension Plan.

         (d) (i) No RJR Welfare Plan is unfunded, funded through a "welfare
benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) or
self-insured, except for the provision of severance and vacation benefits; (ii)
There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that
are reasonably likely to prevent any RJR Welfare Plan (including any such plan
covering retirees or other former employees) from being amended or terminated
without a RJR Material Adverse Effect on or at any time after the Effective Time
(except for ordinary administrative expenses); and (iii) No RJR Welfare Plan
provides benefits after termination of employment, except where the cost thereof
is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible dependents or
beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

         (e) Except with respect to the individuals set forth in Section 3.11(e)
of the RJR Disclosure Letter (the "Primary RJR Executives"), no amount that
could be received (whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a
result of the Merger or any other Transaction by any RJR Personnel who is a
"disqualified individual" (as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.280G-1) under any
RJR Benefit Plan, RJR Benefit Agreement or other compensation arrangement is
reasonably likely to be characterized as an "excess parachute payment" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code) and no such disqualified individual
is entitled to receive any additional payment (e.g., any Tax gross-up or other
payment) from RJR, the Surviving Corporation, Reynolds American or any other
person in the event that the


<PAGE>

                                                                              30

excise Tax required by Section 4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such
disqualified individual.

         (f) The execution and delivery by RJR and each RJR Subsidiary of each
Transaction Agreement to which it is a party do not, and the consummation of the
Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and
thereof will not (either alone or in combination with any other event) (i)
entitle any RJR Personnel to any additional compensation, severance or other
benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any RJR Benefit Plan or RJR Benefit Agreement or (iii) result in
any breach or violation of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of
time or both) under, any RJR Benefit Plan or RJR Benefit Agreement.

         (g) The deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of the
RJR Benefit Plans or RJR Benefit Agreements will not be subject to disallowance
under Section 162(m) of the Code or any other applicable Law.

         (h) Since January 1, 2001, and through the date of this Agreement,
neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has received notice of, and, to the knowledge
of RJR, there are no (i) pending termination proceedings or other suits, claims
(except claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the RJR Benefit
Plans), actions or proceedings against or involving any RJR Benefit Plan or RJR
Benefit Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely
to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect or (ii) pending investigations (other than
routine inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any RJR Benefit
Plan or RJR Benefit Agreement. All contributions, premiums and benefit payments
under or in connection with the RJR Benefit Plans or RJR Benefit Agreements that
are required to have been made by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary have been timely
made, accrued or reserved for in all material respects.

         (i) Neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has any material liability or
obligations, including under or on account of a RJR Benefit Plan or RJR Benefit
Agreement, arising out of the hiring of persons to provide services to RJR or
any RJR Subsidiary and treating such persons as consultants or independent
contractors and not as employees


<PAGE>

                                                                              31

of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary, other than the obligations of RJR or any RJR
Subsidiary under any Contract, arrangement or understanding with any such
person.

         SECTION 3.12. Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of RJR, any Action threatened or investigation pending or threatened
against RJR or any RJR Subsidiary, except for Actions or investigations that (a)
arise out of or relate to the development, packaging, labeling, delivery, sale,
resale, distribution, marketing, promotion, use or consumption of, or exposure
to, tobacco products, including smoking and health-related and safety-related
claims or (b) individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. There is no Judgment
outstanding against RJR or any RJR Subsidiary that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse
Effect. Section 3.12 of the RJR Disclosure Letter sets forth a list of all
material litigation in which RJR or any RJR Subsidiary is currently a party
(other than litigation of the type described in clause (a) above).

         SECTION 3.13. Compliance with Applicable Laws. RJR and the RJR
Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws and Permits, including
Environmental Laws and those relating to occupational health and safety, except
for instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the aggregate, have not
had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. Neither
RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has received any written communication during the
past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges that RJR or a RJR
Subsidiary has any liability under or is not in compliance with any applicable
Law or Permit, including Environmental Law, except for such liabilities and
instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. There
exists no Environmental Condition (as defined in Section 9.03) that,
individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a RJR
Material Adverse Effect. There are no capital expenditures in excess of
$10,000,000 required to be made for pollution control equipment or other
remedial measures pursuant to Environmental Laws that have not been reserved
for, or reflected on, the Filed RJR SEC Documents. This Section 3.13 does not
relate to matters with respect to


<PAGE>

                                                                              32

Taxes, which are the subject of Section 3.09, and employment and labor matters,
which are the subject of Sections 3.10, 3.11 and 3.16.

         SECTION 3.14. Title to Properties. RJR and each of the RJR Subsidiaries
has good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in, all its
properties and assets except for such as are no longer used in the conduct of
its businesses or as have been disposed of in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice and except for defects in title, easements,
restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances or impediments that, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR
Material Adverse Effect. All such assets and properties, other than assets and
properties in which RJR or any of the RJR Subsidiaries has leasehold interests,
are free and clear of all Liens except for Liens that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material
Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 3.15. Intellectual Property. (a) RJR and the RJR Subsidiaries
own, or are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, in each case
free and clear of any Liens, all Intellectual Property (as defined in Section
9.03) used or necessary to carry on its business as now being conducted except
for Intellectual Property the failure of which to own or have the right to use
is not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. The consummation
of the Transactions will not conflict with the rights of RJR or any RJR
Subsidiary in its Intellectual Property except for conflicts that, individually
or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse
Effect.

         (b) None of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary has infringed upon,
misappropriated or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property
or other proprietary information of any other person, except for any such
infringement, misappropriation or other conflict that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material
Adverse Effect. During the two years preceding the date of this Agreement, (i)
none of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary has received any written material charge,
complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such infringement,
misappropriation or other conflict (including any claim that RJR or any RJR
Subsidiary must license or refrain from using any


<PAGE>

                                                                              33

Intellectual Property or other proprietary information of any other person), and
(ii) none of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary is party to or the subject of any pending
or, to the knowledge of RJR, threatened, Action before or by any Governmental
Entity with respect to any such infringement, misappropriation or conflict, in
each case except for such suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings
that have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse
Effect. To RJR's knowledge, no other person has infringed upon, misappropriated
or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property owned by,
licensed to or otherwise used by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary, except for any such
infringement, misappropriation or other conflict that, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material
Adverse Effect.

         (c) Each of RJR and the RJR Subsidiaries has taken all reasonable and
necessary steps to protect their material Intellectual Property and rights
thereunder, and, to the knowledge of RJR, no such rights to material
Intellectual Property have been lost or are in jeopardy of being lost as a
result of any act or omission by RJR or any RJR Subsidiary.

         SECTION 3.16. Labor and Employment Matters. There are no collective
bargaining or other labor union agreements to which RJR or any RJR Subsidiary is
a party or by which any of them is bound. To the knowledge of RJR, since January
1, 2001, neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary has encountered any labor union
organizing activity or had any actual or threatened employee strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts, except for any such labor union organizing
activity or actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or
lockouts that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect. Except with respect to
instances that, individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to
have a RJR Material Adverse Effect, RJR and each RJR Subsidiary (a) is, and
since January 1, 2001, has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws relating
to employment and employment practices, occupational safety and health
standards, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and (b) is
not, and since January 1, 2001, has not, engaged in any unfair labor practice.
During the two years preceding the date of this Agreement, RJR has not received
written

notice of any unfair labor practice charge against RJR or any RJR Subsidiary
which is pending.

         SECTION 3.17. Contracts. (a) Section 3.17 of the RJR Disclosure Letter
sets forth a list as of the date of this Agreement of each of the following
types of Contracts to which RJR or any RJR Subsidiary is a party:

         (iii) any Contract for the purchase or other acquisition by RJR or any

      than in the ordinary course of business;

         (iv) any Contract providing for the sale or other disposition after the

      goods or services for $20,000,000 or more, other than in the ordinary
      course of business;

         (v) any partnership, joint venture or other similar Contract or
      arrangement;

         (vi) any Contract relating to the acquisition or disposition of any

      or otherwise) or the making of any capital expenditures, in each case
      after the date of this Agreement, in excess of $20,000,000;

         (vii) any material license, assignment, transfer or similar Contract
      pursuant to which any third party has rights to use or own any material
      Intellectual Property of RJR;


<PAGE>
                                                                              35

         (viii) any material Contract that would materially restrict the ability
      of Reynolds American or any of its subsidiaries to compete in any line of
      business in any geographic area;

         (ix) any Contract with any RJR Personnel (other than RJR Benefit
      Agreements or RJR Benefit Plans); or

         (x) any Contract providing for indemnification of any person with
      respect to material liabilities relating to any former (not current)
      business of RJR, any RJR Subsidiary or any affiliate or predecessor person
      thereof.

         (b) None of RJR, any of the RJR Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of
RJR, any other party thereto is in violation of or in default under (nor does
there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice
or both would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which
it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or other assets is bound,
except for violations or defaults that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material Adverse Effect.
Neither RJR nor any of the RJR Subsidiaries has entered into any Contract with
any affiliate of RJR (other than any RJR Subsidiary) that is currently in effect
other than Contracts that are filed as exhibits to the Filed RJR SEC Documents.
Each Contract listed or described in Section 3.17 of the RJR Disclosure Letter
or required to be so listed or described is a valid and binding obligation of
RJR or the RJR Subsidiary party thereto.

         SECTION 3.18. Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No broker,
investment banker, financial advisor or other person, other than Lehman Brothers
Inc. ("Lehman") and J.P. Morgan Chase ("JPM"), the fees and expenses of which
will be paid by RJR, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's
or other similar fee or commission in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of RJR. RJR has
furnished to B&W a true and complete copies of all agreements between RJR and
Lehman and between RJR and JPM relating to the Merger and the other
Transactions.

         SECTION 3.19. Opinions of Financial Advisors. RJR has received the oral

<PAGE>

                                                                              36

as of the date of this Agreement (which oral advice will be confirmed in a
written opinion dated as of the date of this Agreement), to the effect that, as
of such date, and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the
consideration to be received in the Merger by the holders of RJR Common Stock is
fair to such holders from a financial point of view.

         SECTION 3.20. Insurance. Except to the extent that insurance coverage
with respect to tobacco product-related liabilities is unobtainable or is
obtainable only at a cost which RJR reasonably believes to be prohibitive or
unreasonable, RJR and each RJR Subsidiary have insurance with coverages of a
type and in a manner that RJR believes is prudent and reasonable in the
circumstances. No written notice of cancelation or threat thereof in writing
with respect to any such material policy has been received. All such material
policies are in full force and effect and neither RJR nor any RJR Subsidiary is
in default, whether as to payment of premium or otherwise, in any material
respect under the terms of any such policy, nor, to the knowledge of RJR, has
RJR or any RJR Subsidiary done or omitted to do any act or thing which could
render any such material insurance policy void or voidable.

         SECTION 3.21. Absence of B&W Transaction Material Adverse Effect. RJR
represents, acknowledges and agrees that no state of fact or circumstance with
respect to the B&W Business (as defined in Section 9.03) existing as of the date
of this Agreement constitutes a B&W Transaction Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in Section 9.03).

                                   ARTICLE IV

                      Representations and Warranties of B&W

         B&W represents and warrants to RJR that as of the date of this
Agreement, except as set forth in the disclosure letter dated the date of this
Agreement (with specific reference to the particular Section or subsection of
this Agreement to which the information set forth in such disclosure letter
relates; provided, however, that any information set forth in one section of
such disclosure letter shall be deemed to apply to each other Section or
subsection thereof or hereof to which its relevance is


<PAGE>

                                                                              37

readily apparent) delivered by B&W to RJR prior to the execution of this
Agreement (the "B&W Disclosure Letter"); provided, however, for avoidance of
doubt, the parties hereto agree that the representations and warranties set
forth in this Article IV, except for Section 4.03, do not apply to any Excluded
Subsidiary (as defined in the B&W Opco Formation Agreement) or its business,
financial condition, properties, assets, liabilities or results of operations:

         SECTION 4.01. Organization, Standing and Power. Each of B&W and each
subsidiary of B&W (each a "B&W Subsidiary", taking into account the proviso in
the definition of "subsidiary") is duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized and has
full corporate power and authority and possesses all Permits and approvals
necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and assets
and to conduct its businesses as presently conducted, other than such Permits
and approvals the lack of which, individually or in the aggregate, has not had
and is not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in Section 9.03). B&W and each B&W Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business
in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business or the ownership or
leasing of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than
jurisdictions in which the failure to so qualify has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. B&W has made available
to RJR true and complete copies of the charter and organizational documents of
each B&W Subsidiary, in each case as amended through the date of this Agreement.

         SECTION 4.02. B&W Subsidiaries; Equity Interests. (a) Section 4.02 of
the B&W Disclosure Letter lists as of the date of this Agreement each B&W
Subsidiary and its jurisdiction of organization. All the outstanding shares of
capital stock of, or other equity, voting or ownership interests in, each B&W
Subsidiary have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and are
owned by B&W, by a B&W Subsidiary or by B&W and another B&W Subsidiary, free and
clear of all Liens. None of such outstanding shares of capital stock of, or
other equity, voting or ownership interests in, any B&W Subsidiary has been
issued in violation of, and is not subject to, any preemptive, subscription or
similar rights under any


<PAGE>

                                                                              38

provision of applicable Law, its charter or constituent documents, any Contract
to which such B&W Subsidiary is subject, bound or a party or otherwise. There
are no outstanding warrants, options, rights, "phantom" stock rights, Contracts,
convertible or exchangeable securities or other commitments (other than this
Agreement) (i) pursuant to which B&W or any affiliate of B&W (a "B&W Company")
is or may become obligated to issue, sell, purchase, return or redeem any shares
of capital stock or other securities of a B&W Subsidiary or (ii) that give any
person the right to receive any economic benefits or rights similar to or
derived from the economic benefits or rights accruing to holders of shares of
capital stock of a B&W Subsidiary. There are no equity securities of a B&W
Subsidiary reserved for issuance for any purpose.

         (b) Except for the capital stock of, or equity, voting or other
ownership interests in, the B&W Subsidiaries and the Excluded Subsidiaries (as
defined in the B&W Opco Formation Agreement), B&W does not, and will not after
giving effect to the Asset Contribution, own, directly or indirectly, any
capital stock, membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest
or equity, voting or other ownership interest in any person.

         SECTION 4.03. The Contributed Assets. The Contributed Assets to be
transferred, conveyed or assigned to B&W Opco at the Closing will include all of
the properties, assets and rights used primarily, or held for use primarily, in
the operation or conduct of the B&W Business, other than the Excluded Assets (as
defined in the B&W Opco Formation Agreement).

         SECTION 4.04. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability. Each
of B&W and each B&W Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver each Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be a
party, to perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery by each of B&W and each B&W Company of
each Transaction Agreement to which it is or will be a party, the performance by
it of its obligations hereunder and thereunder and the consummation by B&W and
each B&W Company of each of the Transactions to which it is or will be a party
have been or will be duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the
part of B&W and such B&W Company, as the case may be. Each of B&W and each B&W
Company has duly executed and delivered (or will duly


<PAGE>
                                                                              39

execute and deliver on or prior to the Closing Date) each Transaction Agreement
to which it is or will be a party, and each Transaction Agreement to which it is
or will be a party constitutes (or will constitute on or prior to the Closing
Date) its legal, valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms.

         SECTION 4.05. No Conflicts; Consents. (a) The execution and delivery by
each of B&W and each B&W Company of each Transaction Agreement to which it is or
will be a party and the performance by it of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder do not, and the consummation of the Asset Contribution, the
Assumption of Liabilities, the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the other
Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not, conflict
with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice or lapse
of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination, cancelation or
acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit under, or to
increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements of any
person under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of the Contributed
Assets under, any provision of (i) the B&W certificate of incorporation or the
B&W by-laws or the comparable charter or organizational documents of any other
B&W Company, (ii) any material Contract to which B&W or any B&W Company is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets is bound or (iii)
subject to the filings and other matters referred to in Section 4.05(b), any
Judgment or Law applicable to B&W, B&W Opco or any other B&W Company or their
respective properties or assets, other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and
(iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and are not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect.

         (b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or
Permit from, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or
with respect to B&W or any B&W Subsidiary in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by B&W or any B&W Company of any Transaction Agreement
to which it is a party or the consummation by it of the Transactions, other than
(i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act, (ii) any required approval of
the Transactions by the European Commission pursuant to the EC Merger
Regulation, (iii) any required approvals or filings under the antitrust laws of

member states of the European Union, (iv) the filing with the SEC of (A) the

filings required in connection with the Tax Rulings, (vi) filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and
appropriate documents with the relevant authorities of the other jurisdictions
in which the B&W Subsidiaries are qualified to do business, (vii) such filings
with and approvals of the NYSE as are required to permit the shares of Reynolds
American Common Stock that are to be issued in the Share Issuance to be listed
on the NYSE, (viii) such filings with and approvals of the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, state licensing authorities and state taxing
authorities as are required to transfer Permits to B&W Opco or to otherwise
consummate the Transactions, (ix) compliance with any such filings as may be
required under applicable Environmental Law, (x) such filings as may be required
in connection with the taxes described in Section 6.09 and (xi) such other items
that the failure of which to obtain or make, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect.

         SECTION 4.06. B&W Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities. (a)
The B&W Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) the audited consolidated balance sheets
of B&W and its subsidiaries for each of the three fiscal years ended as of

likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect.

            (b) The B&W Audited Historical Financial Statements reflect an
adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by B&W and the B&W Subsidiaries (in
addition to any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences between
book and Tax items) for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the
date of such financial statements, except to the extent any failure to make such
a reserve, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably
likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. No deficiency, audit examination,
refund litigation, proposed adjustment or matter in controversy with respect to
any Taxes has been proposed, asserted or assessed against B&W, any B&W
Subsidiary or any B&W Affiliated Group since January 1, 2001, except to the
extent any such proposal, assertion or assessment,

                                                                              45


individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to
have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. No requests for waivers of the time to
assess any Taxes of B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or any B&W Affiliated Group are
pending, and there is no effective agreement or other document extending, or
having the effect of extending, the period of assessment or collection of any
Taxes of B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or any B&W Affiliated Group, except to the
extent any such deficiency or request for waiver, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material
Adverse Effect.

      (c) The Federal income Tax Returns of B&W and each B&W Subsidiary have
been examined by and settled with the IRS, or have closed by virtue of the
expiration of the relevant statute of limitations, for all years through 1995.
All material assessments for Taxes due and owing by B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or
any B&W Affiliated Group with respect to completed and settled examinations or
any concluded litigation have been fully paid, except to the extent any failure
to pay any such assessment for Taxes, individually or in the aggregate, has not
had and is not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect.

      (d) There are no material Liens for Taxes (other than for current Taxes
not yet due and payable) on the Contributed Assets.

      (e) Neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary has taken or agreed to take any
action or knows of any fact, agreement, plan or other circumstance that is
reasonably likely (i) to prevent the Asset Contribution and Assumption of
Liabilities, on the one hand, or the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the Merger,
on the other hand, from qualifying as an exchange within the meaning of Section
351 of the Code, or to prevent the Merger also from qualifying as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (ii) to
prevent the SF Contribution from qualifying as an exchange within the meaning of
Section 351 of the Code and also as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code.

      (f) None of B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or any B&W Company has taken any
action, other than in the ordinary course of business, that would have the
effect of deferring any liability for Taxes for any B&W Subsidiary from any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date to any taxable period ending
thereafter, whether pursuant to

                                                                              46


Section 481(a) of the Code or any similar provision of law or regulations or for
any other reason.

            SECTION 4.10 Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans. From December 31,
2002, through the date of this Agreement, there has not been (a) any
termination, adoption or amendment in any material respect or any agreement to
terminate, adopt or amend in any material respect, by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary
of any collective bargaining agreement or any bonus, pension, profit sharing,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock ownership, stock purchase,
stock appreciation, restricted stock, stock repurchase rights, stock option,
"phantom stock", performance, retirement, vacation, severance, disability, death
benefit, hospitalization, medical or other plan, arrangement or understanding
(whether or not legally binding and whether or not subject to the laws of the
United States) maintained or contributed to, or required to be maintained or
contributed to, by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary, in each case, providing benefits
to any B&W Personnel (all such plans, arrangements or understandings, including
any such plan, arrangement or understanding which is entered into or adopted on
or after the date of this Agreement, collectively, "B&W Benefit Plans") or (b)
any material change in the manner in which contributions to any B&W Pension
Plans (as defined in Section 4.11(a)) are made or the basis on which such
contributions are determined. Neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary is a party to
any B&W Benefit Agreement.

            SECTION 4.11 ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments. (a) The
B&W Disclosure Letter contains a list of all "employee pension benefit plans"
(as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) ("B&W Pension Plans"), "employee welfare
benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) ("B&W Welfare Plans") and
all other B&W Benefit Plans. Each B&W Benefit Plan has been administered in
compliance with its terms and applicable Law, except where the failure to be so
administered, individually or in the aggregate, has not had and is not
reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. B&W has made available
to RJR true, complete and correct copies of (i) each B&W Benefit Plan and B&W
Benefit Agreement (or, in the case of any unwritten B&W Benefit Plan or B&W
Benefit Agreement, a description thereof), (ii) the most recent annual report on
Form 5500 filed with the IRS with respect to each B&W Benefit Plan for which
such annual report was required,
<PAGE>
                                                                              47


(iii) the most recent summary plan description for each B&W Benefit Plan for
which such summary plan description is required, (iv) the most recent actuarial
valuation report for each B&W Benefit Plan for which such actuarial valuation
report was required or prepared and (v) each trust agreement and group annuity
contract relating to any B&W Benefit Plan.

      (b) All B&W Pension Plans intended to be tax qualified are so qualified
and have been the subject of determination letters from the IRS or other
Governmental Entity with respect to all Tax Law changes through and including
the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 or have a
remaining period of time under applicable Law to amend such B&W Pension Plans to
comply with applicable Tax Law and to submit such amendment to the IRS for a
determination letter to the effect that such B&W Pension Plans are qualified and
exempt from United States Federal income Taxes under Sections 401(a) and 501(a),
respectively, of the Code, and no determination letter has been revoked (nor, to
the knowledge of B&W, has revocation been threatened). No event has occurred
since the date of the most recent determination letter or application therefor
relating to any such B&W Pension Plan that would adversely affect the
qualification of such B&W Pension Plan or increase the costs relating thereto or
require security under Section 307 of ERISA, except for events that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a B&W
Material Adverse Effect. All B&W Pension Plans required to have been approved by
any non-U.S. Governmental Entity have been so approved or timely submitted for
approval and no such approval has been revoked (nor, to the knowledge of B&W,
has revocation been threatened). No event has occurred since the date of the
most recent approval or application therefor relating to any such B&W Pension
Plan that would affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs
relating thereto, except for events that, individually or in the aggregate, are
not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. B&W has made
available to RJR a true, complete and correct copy of the most recent
determination or approval letter received with respect to each B&W Pension Plan,
as well as a true, complete and correct copy of each pending application for a
determination or approval letter, if any.

                                                                              48


      (c) No B&W Pension Plan, other than any B&W Pension Plan that is a
"multiemployer plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA (a "B&W
Multiemployer Pension Plan"), had, as of the respective last annual valuation
date for each such B&W Pension Plan, an "unfunded benefit liability" (as such
term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions
that have been furnished to RJR. No B&W Pension Plan has an "accumulated funding
deficiency" (as such term is defined in Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code), whether or not waived, nor has any waiver of the minimum funding
standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code been requested of
or granted by the IRS with respect to any B&W Pension Plan. With respect to each
B&W Benefit Plan, (i) there has not occurred any prohibited transaction in which
B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or any of its or their respective employees or, to the
knowledge of B&W, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of any B&W
Benefit Plan or trust created thereunder has engaged that is reasonably likely
to subject B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or any of its or their respective employees,
or, to the knowledge of B&W, any trustee or other fiduciary or administrator of
any B&W Benefit Plan or any trust created thereunder, to any Tax or penalty on
prohibited transactions imposed by Section 4975 of the Code or the sanctions
imposed under Title I of ERISA or any other applicable Law of a magnitude that
would result in a B&W Material Adverse Effect and (ii) none of B&W, any B&W
Subsidiary or any of its or their respective employees, or, to the knowledge of
B&W, any trustee or other fiduciary of any B&W Benefit Plan or any trust created
thereunder, has engaged in any transaction or acted in a manner that is
reasonably likely to, or failed to act in a manner that is reasonably likely to,
subject B&W, any B&W Subsidiary, or, to the knowledge of B&W, any trustee or
other fiduciary of any B&W Benefit Plan or any trust created thereunder, to any
liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other applicable Law
of a magnitude that would result in a B&W Material Adverse Effect. No B&W
Benefit Plan or trust has been terminated, nor has there been any "reportable
event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA) with respect to any
B&W Benefit Plan during the last five years. Neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary
has incurred a "complete withdrawal" or a "partial withdrawal" (as such terms
are defined in Sections 4203 and 4205, respectively, of ERISA) since the
effective date of such
<PAGE>
                                                                              49


Sections 4203 and 4205 with respect to any B&W Multiemployer Pension Plan.

      (d) (i) No B&W Welfare Plan is unfunded, funded through a "welfare
benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the Code) or
self-insured, except for the provision of severance and vacation benefits; (ii)
There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral, that
are reasonably likely to prevent any B&W Welfare Plan (including any such plan
covering retirees or other former employees) from being amended or terminated
without a B&W Material Adverse Effect on or at any time after the Effective Time
(except for ordinary administrative expenses); and (iii) No B&W Welfare Plan
provides benefits after termination of employment, except where the cost thereof
is borne entirely by the former employee (or his eligible dependents or
beneficiaries) or as required by Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

      (e) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the Merger or any other Transaction by any
B&W Personnel who is a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Treas. Reg.
Section 1.280G-1) under any B&W Benefit Plan, B&W Benefit Agreement or other
compensation arrangement is reasonably likely to be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code)and no such
disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional payment (e.g., any
Tax gross-up or other payment) from B&W, B&W Opco, Reynolds American or any
other person in the event that the excise Tax required by Section 4999(a) of the
Code is imposed on such disqualified individual.

      (f) The execution and delivery by B&W, B&W Opco and each B&W Subsidiary of
each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party do not, and the consummation
of the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms hereof
and thereof will not (either alone or in combination with any other event) (i)
entitle any B&W Personnel to any additional compensation, severance or other
benefits, (ii) accelerate the time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment
or funding (through a grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits
under, increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation
pursuant to, any B&W Benefit Plan or B&W Benefit Agreement, (iii) result in any
breach or
<PAGE>
                                                                              50


violation of, or a default (with or without notice or lapse of time or
both) under, any B&W Benefit Plan or B&W Benefit Agreement or (iv) constitute a
severance of employment of any B&W Personnel under any severance or termination
benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement of B&W or any B&W
Subsidiary.

      (g) Since January 1, 2001, and through the date of this Agreement, neither
B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary has received notice of, and, to the knowledge of B&W,
there are no (i) pending termination proceedings or other suits, claims (except
claims for benefits payable in the normal operation of the B&W Benefit Plans),
actions or proceedings against or involving any B&W Benefit Plan or B&W Benefit
Agreement that, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably likely to have
a B&W Material Adverse Effect or (ii) pending investigations (other than routine
inquiries) by any Governmental Entity with respect to any B&W Benefit Plan or
B&W Benefit Agreement. All contributions, premiums and benefit payments under or
in connection with the B&W Benefit Plans or B&W Benefit Agreements that are
required to have been made by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary have been timely made,
accrued or reserved for in all material respects.

      (h) Neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary has any material liability or
obligations that constitute Assumed Liabilities, including under or on account
of a B&W Benefit Plan or B&W Benefit Agreement, arising out of the hiring of
persons to provide services to B&W or any B&W Subsidiary and treating such
persons as consultants or independent contractors and not as employees of B&W or
any B&W Subsidiary, other than the obligations of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary
under any Contract, arrangement or understanding with any such person.

      (i) There does not exist, nor do any circumstances exist that could
reasonably be expected to result in, any Employee Benefits Liability that could
reasonably be expected to result in a B&W Material Adverse Effect. "Employee
Benefits Liability" means any liability of any B&W Commonly Controlled Entity
under (i) Sections 302, 405 and 409 or Title IV of ERISA, (ii) Sections 412,
4971 and 4975 of the Code, (iii) Sections 601 et seq. and 701 et seq. of ERISA
and Section 4980B and Sections 9801 et seq. of the Code or (iv) any
corresponding or similar provision of any applicable Federal, state, local or
non-U.S. laws, rules or regulations. "B&W
<PAGE>
                                                                              51


Commonly Controlled Entity" means any person that, together with B&W, is treated
as a single employer under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or any
other applicable Law.

            SECTION 4.12 Litigation. There is no Action pending or, to the
knowledge of B&W, any Action threatened or investigation pending or threatened
against B&W or any B&W Subsidiary pursuant to which the plaintiff seeks damages
that are or would be Assumed Liabilities or which relate to Contributed Assets
or Assumed Liabilities, except for Actions or investigations that (a) arise out
of or relate to the development, packaging, labeling, delivery, sale, resale,
distribution, marketing, promotion, use or consumption of, or exposure to,
tobacco products, including smoking and health-related and safety-related claims
or (b) individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably
likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. There is no Judgment that
constitutes an Assumed Liability outstanding against B&W or any B&W Subsidiary
that, individually or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have
a B&W Material Adverse Effect. Section 4.12 of the B&W Disclosure Letter sets
forth a list of all material litigation in which B&W or any B&W Subsidiary is
currently a party (other than litigation of the type described in clause (a)
above).

            SECTION 4.13 Compliance with Applicable Laws. B&W and each of the
B&W Subsidiaries are in compliance with all applicable Laws and Permits,
including Environmental Laws and those relating to occupational health and
safety, except for instances of noncompliance that, individually and in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material
Adverse Effect. Neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary has received any written
communication during the past two years from a Governmental Entity that alleges
that B&W or a B&W Subsidiary has liability under or is not in compliance with
any applicable Law or Permit, including Environmental Law, except for such
liabilities and instances of noncompliance that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material
Adverse Effect. There exists no Environmental Condition that, individually or in
the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse
Effect. There are no capital expenditures in excess of $10,000,000 required to
be made for pollution control equipment or other remedial measures
<PAGE>
                                                                              52


pursuant to Environmental Laws at any of the Contributed Assets that have not
been reserved for, or reflected on, the B&W Opco Interim 2003 Balance Sheet.
This Section 4.13 does not relate to matters with respect to Taxes, which are
the subject of Section 4.09, and employment and labor matters, which are the
subject of Sections 4.10, 4.11 and 4.16.

            SECTION 4.14 Title to Properties. B&W and each of the B&W
Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to, or valid leasehold interests in,
all the Contributed Assets, except for such as are no longer used in the conduct
of the business to be transferred to B&W Opco as a result of the Contribution of
Assets and Assumption of Liabilities or as have been disposed of in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice and except for defects in
title, easements, restrictive covenants and similar encumbrances or impediments
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably
likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. All such Contributed Assets, other
than assets and properties in which B&W or any of the B&W Subsidiaries has
leasehold interests, are free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to
have a B&W Material Adverse Effect.

            SECTION 4.15 Intellectual Property. (a) B&W and each of the B&W
Subsidiaries own, or are validly licensed or otherwise have the right to use, in
each case free and clear of any Liens, all Intellectual Property used or
necessary to carry on the business to be transferred to B&W Opco as a result of
the Asset Contribution and Assumption of Liabilities as it is now being
conducted, except for Intellectual Property the failure of which to own or have
the right to use is not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect.
The consummation of the Transactions will not conflict with the rights of B&W or
any B&W Subsidiary in the Intellectual Property used or necessary to carry on
the business to be transferred to B&W Opco except for conflicts that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not reasonably likely to have a B&W
Material Adverse Effect.

      (b) None of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary has infringed upon, misappropriated
or otherwise come into conflict with any Intellectual Property or other
proprietary information of any other person, except for any
<PAGE>
                                                                              53


such infringement, misappropriation or other conflict that, individually or in
the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material
Adverse Effect. During the two years preceding the date of this Agreement, (i)
none of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary has received any written material charge,
complaint, claim, demand or notice alleging any such infringement,
misappropriation or other conflict (including any claim that B&W or any B&W
Subsidiary must license or refrain from using any Intellectual Property or other
proprietary information of any other person), and (ii) none of B&W or any B&W
Subsidiary is party to or the subject of any pending or, to the knowledge of
B&W, threatened, Action before or by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
such infringement, misappropriation or conflict, in each case except for such
suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings that have not had and are
not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. To B&W's knowledge,
no other person has infringed upon, misappropriated or otherwise come into
conflict with any Intellectual Property owned by, licensed to or otherwise used
by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary that constitutes a Contributed Asset, except for
any such infringement, misappropriation or other conflict that, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had and is not reasonably likely to have a B&W
Material Adverse Effect.

            (c) B&W and the B&W Subsidiaries have taken all reasonable and
necessary steps to protect their material Intellectual Property that constitutes
Contributed Assets and rights thereunder, and, to the knowledge of B&W, no such
rights to material Intellectual Property that constitutes Contributed Assets
have been lost or are in jeopardy of being lost as a result of any act or
omission by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary.

            SECTION 4.16 Labor and Employment Matters. There are no collective
bargaining or other labor union agreements to which B&W or any B&W Subsidiary is
a party or by which any of them is bound. To the knowledge of B&W, since January
1, 2001, neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary has encountered any labor union
organizing activity or had any actual or threatened employee strikes, work
stoppages, slowdowns or lockouts, except for any such labor union organizing
activity or actual or threatened employee strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns or
lockouts that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not
reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse
<PAGE>
                                                                              54


Effect. Except with respect to instances that, individually or in the aggregate,
are not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect B&W (a) is, and
since January 1, 2001, has been, in compliance with all applicable Laws relating
to employment and employment practices, occupational safety and health
standards, terms and conditions of employment and wages and hours, and (b) is
not, and since January 1, 2001, has not, engaged in any unfair labor practice.
During the two years preceding the date of this Agreement, B&W has not received
written notice of any unfair labor practice charge against B&W or any B&W
Subsidiary which is pending.

            SECTION 4.17 Contracts. (a) Section 4.17 of the B&W Disclosure
Letter sets forth a list as of the date of this Agreement of each of the
following types of Contracts relating to the B&W Business (except to the extent
such Contracts relate solely to Excluded Assets or Excluded Liabilities):

            (i) any material Contract granting any person a right of first
      refusal, first offer or other right to purchase any Contributed Asset;

            (ii) any material loan agreement, indenture, mortgage, promissory
      note, pledge, hypothecation, deed of trust, conditional sale or title
      retention agreement, security agreement, equipment financing obligation,
      guaranty or other source of contingent liability;

            (iii) any Contract for the purchase or other acquisition by B&W or
      any B&W Subsidiary of goods or services or other assets that provides for
      annual payments by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary of $20,000,000 or more, other
      than in the ordinary course of business;

            (iv) any Contract providing for the sale or other disposition after
      the date of this Agreement by B&W or any B&W Subsidiary to another person
      of goods or services for $20,000,000 or more, other than in the ordinary
      course of business;

            (v) any partnership, joint venture or other similar Contract or
      arrangement;


<PAGE>

                                                                              55

                  (vi) any Contract relating to the acquisition or disposition
         of any business (whether by merger, consolidation, sale of stock, sale
         of assets or otherwise) or the making of any capital expenditures, in
         each case after the date of this Agreement, in excess of $20,000,000;

                  (vii) any material license, assignment, transfer or similar
         Contract pursuant to which any third party has rights to use or own any
         material Intellectual Property of B&W;

                  (viii) any material Contract that would materially restrict
         the ability of Reynolds American or any of its subsidiaries to compete
         in any line of business in any geographic area;

                  (ix) any Contract with (A) B&W or any affiliate of B&W (other
         than B&W or a B&W Subsidiary) or (B) any B&W Personnel (other than B&W
         Benefit Agreements or B&W Benefit Plans); or

                  (x) any Contract providing for indemnification of any person
         with respect to material liabilities relating to any former (not
         current) business of B&W, any B&W Subsidiary or any affiliate or
         predecessor person thereof.

                  (b) None of B&W, any of the B&W Subsidiaries or, to the
knowledge of B&W, any other party thereto is in violation of or in default under
(nor does there exist any condition that, upon the passage of time or the giving
of notice or both, would cause such a violation of or default under) any
Contract that constitutes a Contributed Asset, except for violations or defaults
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably
likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect. Each Contract listed or described
in Section 4.17 of the B&W Disclosure Letter or required to be so listed or
described is a valid and binding obligation of B&W or the B&W Subsidiary party
thereto.

                  SECTION 4.18. Brokers; Schedule of Fees and Expenses. No
broker, investment banker, financial advisor or other person is entitled to any
broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or commission in
connection with the Merger and the other Transactions based upon arrangements

however, that an affiliate of B&W (other than a B&W Subsidiary) has engaged, and
will pay the fees and expenses of, Goldman, Sachs & Co. in connection with the
Transactions.

                  SECTION 4.19. Insurance. Except to the extent that insurance
coverage with respect to tobacco product-related liabilities is unobtainable or
is obtainable only at a cost which B&W reasonably believes to be prohibitive or
unreasonable, B&W and each B&W Subsidiary have insurance with coverage of a type
and in a manner that B&W believes is prudent and reasonable in the
circumstances. No written notice of cancelation or threat thereof in writing
with respect to any such material policy has been received. All such material
policies are in full force and effect and neither B&W nor any B&W Subsidiary is
in default, whether as to payment of premium or otherwise, in any material
respect under the terms of any such policy, nor, to the knowledge of B&W, has
B&W or any B&W Subsidiary done or omitted to do any act or thing which could
render any such material insurance policy void or voidable.

                  SECTION 4.20. Absence of RJR Transaction Material Adverse
Effect. B&W represents, acknowledges and agrees that no state of fact or
circumstance with respect to the RJR and the RJR Subsidiaries existing as of the
date of this Agreement constitutes a RJR Transaction Material Adverse Effect.

         materially restricts the ability of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary or which,
         following the consummation of the Merger, could restrict the ability of
         Reynolds American or any of its subsidiaries or RJR or any of its
         subsidiaries or any of their respective affiliates to compete in any
         business or with any person or in any geographic area;

                  (xiii) enter into any material joint venture, partnership or

                  (xv) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of, the
         foregoing actions.

                  (c) Other Actions. RJR and B&W shall not, and shall not permit
any of their respective subsidiaries to, take any action that would, or that is
reasonably likely to, result in (i) any of the representations and warranties of
such party set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality or
Material Adverse Effect becoming untrue, (ii) any of such representations and
warranties that is not so qualified becoming untrue in any material respect or
(iii), except as otherwise permitted by Section 5.02 or 5.03, any condition to

Material Adverse Effect, as the case may be; provided, however, that (A) no
notification pursuant to this Section 5.01(d) shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under any
Transaction Agreement and (B) no breach of this Section 5.01(d) shall result in
the failure of either of the conditions set forth in Section 7.02(b) or 7.03(b).

                  SECTION 5.02. No Solicitation by RJR. (a) RJR shall not, nor
shall it authorize or permit any RJR Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or
permit any officer, director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney,
accountant or other advisor or representative (collectively, "Representatives")
of, RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate
or encourage the submission of, or take any other action to facilitate, any RJR
Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section 5.02(e)), (ii) enter into any agreement

accordance with this Section 5.02(a)) or (iii) enter into, participate in or
continue any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any RJR
Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that, prior to obtaining the RJR
Stockholder Approval, RJR and its Representatives may, in response to a bona
fide written RJR Takeover Proposal that the RJR Board determines in good faith
(after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and outside legal counsel) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a
Superior RJR Proposal (as defined in Section 5.02(e)), and which RJR Takeover
Proposal was unsolicited, was made after the date of this Agreement and did not
otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.02, subject to compliance with
Section 5.02(c), (x) furnish information with respect to RJR and the RJR
Subsidiaries to the person making such RJR Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement not materially
less restrictive of the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement (as
defined in Section 6.02(a)) and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations

Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative or
affiliate of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary, whether or not such person is purporting
to act on behalf of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary or otherwise, shall be deemed to
be a breach of this Section 5.02(a) by RJR. Upon execution of this Agreement,
RJR shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, (i) cease immediately all
discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may
reasonably be expected to lead to, a RJR Takeover Proposal and (ii) promptly
request each person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality agreement in
the last twelve months to return or destroy all information heretofore furnished
to such person by or on behalf of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary.

                  (b) Neither the RJR Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to B&W) the recommendation by the
RJR Board or any such committee of this Agreement and the Merger, (B) determine
that this Agreement or the Merger is no longer advisable, (C) recommend that the
stockholders of RJR reject this Agreement or the Merger, (D) recommend the
approval or adoption of any RJR Takeover Proposal or (E) resolve, agree or
propose publicly to take any such actions, in each case unless the RJR Board or
a committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with outside
legal counsel) that failure to take any such action would be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (each such action set forth in this
Section 5.02(b)(i) being referred to herein as a "RJR Adverse Recommendation
Change"), (ii) adopt or approve any RJR Takeover Proposal, or withdraw its
approval of this Agreement or the Merger, or resolve or agree to take any such
actions, (iii) without limiting Section 5.02(b)(i), propose publicly to adopt or
approve any RJR Takeover Proposal or propose publicly to withdraw its approval
of this Agreement or the Merger or resolve or agree to take any such actions or
(iv) cause or permit RJR or any RJR Subsidiary to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement,
partnership agreement or other agreement (each, a "RJR Alternative Acquisition
Agreement") constituting or related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably
likely to lead to, any RJR Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality
agreement referred to in
<PAGE>
                                                                              68

Section 5.02(a)) or resolve or agree to take any such actions. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to obtaining the RJR Stockholder Approval, the RJR Board
may, in response to a Superior RJR Proposal that was unsolicited and that did
not otherwise result from a breach of Section 5.02(a), cause RJR to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and concurrently approve, recommend
and enter into a binding RJR Alternative Acquisition Agreement containing the
terms of a Superior RJR Proposal; provided, however, that RJR shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f), and any purported
termination pursuant to Section 8.01(f) shall be void and of no force or effect,
unless RJR shall have complied with all provisions of this Section 5.02,
including the notification provisions in this Section 5.02, and with all
applicable requirements of Sections 6.07(b) (including the payment of the RJR
Termination Fee (as defined in Section 6.07(b)) prior to or simultaneously with
such termination); provided, further, however, that RJR may not exercise its
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f), (x) until after
the fifth business day following B&W's receipt of written notice from RJR
advising B&W that the RJR Board has received a Superior RJR Proposal and that
such RJR Board will, subject to any action taken by B&W pursuant to this
sentence, cause RJR to accept such Superior RJR Proposal, specifying the terms
and conditions of the Superior RJR Proposal and identifying the person making
such Superior RJR Proposal (a "Notice of Superior RJR Proposal") (it being
understood and agreed that any amendment to the price or any other material term
of a Superior RJR Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior RJR Proposal
and a new five business day period) and (y) unless after such fifth business day
such Superior RJR Proposal remains a Superior RJR Proposal and the RJR Board so
determines in accordance with the definition of "Superior RJR Proposal".

                  (c) In addition to the obligations of RJR set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.02, RJR promptly shall advise B&W
orally and in writing of any RJR Takeover Proposal or any request for
information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to or
contemplates a RJR Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person making any such
RJR Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and the material terms of any such RJR
Takeover Proposal request or inquiry. RJR shall (i) keep B&W fully informed of
the status, including any change to the

material terms of, any such RJR Takeover Proposal, (ii) provide to B&W as soon
as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all
correspondence and other written material sent or provided to RJR from any third
party in connection with any RJR Takeover Proposal or sent or provided by RJR to
any third party in connection with any RJR Takeover Proposal and (iii) to the
extent not previously provided, provide to B&W as soon as practicable copies of
all information provided to any Person in connection with a RJR Takeover
Proposal.

                  (d) Nothing contained in Section 5.02(a) shall prohibit RJR
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
other disclosure to RJR's stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the RJR
Board (after consultation with outside legal counsel), failure so to disclose
would be inconsistent with its obligations under applicable Law.

                  (e) For purposes of this Agreement:

                  "RJR Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
         from any person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to
         lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one
         transaction or a series of transactions, of assets or businesses that
         constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings
         before interest expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization) or the
         assets of RJR and the RJR Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or
         more of any class of equity securities of RJR, any tender offer or
         exchange offer that if consummated would result in any person
         beneficially owning 20% or more of any class of equity securities of
         RJR, or any merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock
         acquisition, asset acquisition, business combination, recapitalization,
         liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share exchange or
         similar transaction involving RJR or any of the RJR Subsidiaries
         pursuant to which any person or the stockholders of any person would
         own 20% or more of any class of equity securities of RJR or of any
         resulting parent company of RJR, other than the Transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements.

                  "Superior RJR Proposal" means any bona fide binding written
         offer (not solicited by or on behalf of RJR or any RJR Subsidiary or
         any of their respective Representatives) made by a third party that if
         consummated would result in such third party (or its stockholders)
         owning, directly or indirectly, more than 42% of the shares of RJR
         Common Stock then outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger
         or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger)
         or all or substantially all the assets of RJR and the RJR Subsidiaries,
         taken as a whole, which the RJR Board determines in good faith (after
         consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
         reputation and outside legal counsel) to be (i) more favorable to the
         stockholders of RJR from a financial point of view than the Merger and
         the other Transactions (taking into account all the terms and
         conditions of such proposal and this Agreement (including any changes
         to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by B&W in response to
         such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being
         completed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and
         other aspects of such proposal.

                  SECTION 5.03. No Solicitation by B&W.

         (a) B&W shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any B&W Subsidiary
         to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Representative of, B&W or any
         B&W Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or
         encourage the submission of, or take any action to facilitate, any B&W
         Takeover Proposal (as defined in Section 5.03(d)), (ii) enter into any
         agreement with respect to any B&W Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter
         into, participate in or continue any discussions or negotiations
         regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or
         otherwise cooperate in any way with, any B&W Takeover Proposal;
         provided, however, that prior to RJR obtaining the RJR Stockholder
         Approval, B&W and its Representatives may, in response to a bona fide
         written B&W Takeover Proposal that the Board of Directors of B&W (the
         "B&W Board") determines in good faith (after consultation with a
         financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
         counsel) constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in, a Superior
         B&W Proposal (as defined in Section 5.03(d)), and which B&W Takeover
         Proposal was unsolicited, was made after the date of this Agreement and
         did not otherwise result from a breach of this

                                                                              71


         Section 5.03, subject to compliance with Section 5.03(c), (x) furnish
         information with respect to B&W and the B&W Subsidiaries to the person
         making such B&W Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
         customary confidentiality agreement not materially less restrictive of
         the other party than the Confidentiality Agreement and (y) participate
         in discussions or negotiations with the person making such B&W Takeover
         Proposal and its Representatives regarding such B&W Takeover Proposal.
         Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the
         restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative
         or affiliate of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary, whether or not such person
         is purporting to act on behalf of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary or
         otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.03(a) by
         B&W. Upon execution of this Agreement, B&W shall, and shall cause its
         Representatives to, (i) cease immediately all discussions and
         negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably
         be expected to lead to, a B&W Takeover Proposal and (ii) promptly
         request each person, if any, that has executed a confidentiality
         agreement in the last twelve months to return or destroy all
         information primarily relating to the B&W Business heretofore furnished
         to such person by or on behalf of B&W or any B&W Subsidiary.

                  (b) Neither the B&W Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)
         adopt or approve any B&W Takeover Proposal, or withdraw its approval of
         this Agreement or the Transactions, or resolve or agree to take any
         such actions, (ii) propose publicly to adopt or approve any B&W
         Takeover Proposal or propose publicly to withdraw its approval of this
         Agreement or the Transactions, or resolve or agree to take any such
         actions, or (iii) cause or permit B&W or any B&W Subsidiary to enter
         into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
         principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, option agreement,
         joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement
         (each, a "B&W Alternative Acquisition Agreement") constituting or
         related to, or which is intended to or is reasonably likely to lead to,
         any B&W Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement
         referred to in Section 5.03(a)), or resolve or agree to take any such
         actions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to RJR obtaining the RJR
         Stockholder Approval, B&W may, in response to a Superior B&W Proposal
         (as defined in Section 5.03(d)) that was unsolicited and that did not

         enter into a binding B&W Alternative Acquisition Agreement containing
         the terms of a Superior B&W Proposal; provided, however, that B&W shall
         not terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g), and any
         purported termination pursuant to Section 8.01(g) shall be void and of
         no force or effect, unless B&W shall have complied with all provisions
         of this Section 5.03, including the notification provisions in this
         Section 5.03, and with all applicable requirements of Sections 6.07(c)
         (including the payment of the B&W Termination Fee (as defined in
         Section 6.07(c)) prior to or simultaneously with such termination);
         provided, further, however, that B&W shall not exercise its right to
         terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g), (x) until after
         the fifth business day following RJR's receipt of written notice from
         B&W advising RJR that the B&W Board has received a Superior B&W
         Proposal and that such B&W Board will, subject to any action taken by
         RJR pursuant to this sentence, accept such Superior B&W Proposal,
         specifying the terms and conditions of the Superior B&W Proposal and
         identifying the person making such Superior B&W Proposal (a "Notice of
         Superior B&W Proposal") (it being understood and agreed that any
         amendment to the price or any other material term of a Superior B&W
         Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior B&W Proposal and a new
         five business day period) and (y) unless after such fifth business day
         such Superior B&W Proposal remains a Superior B&W Proposal and the B&W
         Board so determines in accordance with the definition of "Superior B&W
         Proposal".

                  (c) In addition to the obligations of B&W set forth in
         paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section 5.03, B&W promptly shall advise
         RJR orally and in writing of any B&W Takeover Proposal or any request
         for information or inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to
         or contemplates a B&W Takeover Proposal, the identity of the person
         making any such B&W Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry and the
         material terms of any such B&W Takeover Proposal, request or inquiry.
         B&W shall (i) keep RJR fully informed of the status, including any
         change to the material terms of any such B&W Takeover Proposal, (ii)
         provide to RJR as soon as practicable after receipt or delivery thereof
         with copies of all correspondence and other written material sent or
         provided to B&W from any third party in connection with any B&W

         Takeover Proposal and (iii) to the extent not previously provided,
         provide to RJR as soon as practicable copies of all information
         provided to any person in connection with a B&W Takeover Proposal.

                  "B&W Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer
         from any person relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to
         lead to, any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one

         constitute 20% or more of the revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings

         direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in a merger) or all
         or substantially all the assets of B&W and the B&W Subsidiaries, taken
         as a whole, which the B&W Board determines in good faith (after
         consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
         reputation and outside legal counsel) to be (i) more favorable to B&W
         or the stockholder of B&W from a financial point of view than the
         Transactions (taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
         proposal and this Agreement (including any

         response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of

that they give RJR Stockholder Approval,

except to the extent that the RJR Board shall have withdrawn or modified its
approval or recommendation of this Agreement or the Merger as permitted by
Section 5.02(b). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, RJR agrees
that its obligations pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 6.01(d)

request; provided, however, that such access (A) shall not unreasonably disrupt
the normal operations of any party, (B) shall be subject to any legal
restrictions on a party's ability to provide any information and (iii) shall not
result in a waiver of the attorney-client privilege or the protection of
attorney work-product. All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 6.02

under Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and any rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder or relating thereto and each party will
require its officers and employees responsible for such matters to provide the
other party and its officers such information as may be reasonably requested in
complying with such obligations.

         SECTION 6.03. Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms

                                                                              78


of Reynolds American and certain subsidiaries of BAT will enter into
Manufacturing Contracts to replace the existing manufacturing Contracts that B&W
has entered into with various BAT subsidiaries) and the negotiation and
execution of certain other supply arrangements related thereto (collectively,
the "Commercial Agreements") and (vi) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of the Transaction Agreements. In connection with and
without limiting the foregoing, B&W and RJR shall duly (x) file with the U.S.
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice
the notification and report form (the "HSR Filing") required under the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date of this Agreement and (y) make all necessary
notifications, if any, under the EC Merger Regulation (the "EC Filings"). The
HSR Filing shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR
Act and the EC Filings shall be in substantial compliance with the EC Merger
Regulation. Subject to Section 6.03(c), each party shall cooperate with the
other party to the extent necessary to assist the other party in the preparation
of its HSR Filing and the EC Filings, to request early termination of the

Board shall (x) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement or any other Transaction Agreement and (y) if any

         (b) Nothing in Section 6.03(a) shall require B&W or RJR to dispose of
any of its assets or to limit its freedom of action with respect to any of its
businesses, or to consent to any disposition of the other party's assets or
limits on the other party's freedom of action with respect to any of its
businesses, or to commit or agree to any of the foregoing (each, a "Regulatory
Requirement"),
<PAGE>
                                                                              79


and nothing in Section 6.03(a) shall authorize either B&W or RJR to commit or
agree to any Regulatory Requirement, to obtain any consents, approvals, permits
or authorizations, in connection with, or to remove any impediments to, the
Merger relating to the HSR Act or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any suit, action or proceeding relating to the HSR Act.

         (c) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.03(a) upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this agreement, each of the parties
hereto (i) will, and will cause each of its affiliates to, execute and deliver
each Transaction Agreement to which it is a party on or prior to the Closing

Joinder Agreement and each other Transaction Agreement to which it is a party on
or prior to the Closing Date and (B) as the sole stockholder of Sub to adopt
this Agreement.

         (d) The parties hereto agree that, other than as expressly set forth in
Articles I and II of this Agreement, such party will not permit Reynolds
American (and will cause Reynolds American not to permit Sub) or B&W Opco to

shares of capital stock of, or equity, voting or other ownership interests in,
or any security convertible or exercisable into, any capital stock or other
equity, voting or other ownership interest in Reynolds American, B&W Opco or
Sub.

         SECTION 6.04. RJR Stock Options. (a) As soon as practicable following
the date of this Agreement, the RJR Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
administering RJR Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other
actions as may be required to effect the following:

         (i) adjust the terms of all outstanding RJR Stock Options to provide
     that, at the Effective Time, each RJR Stock Option outstanding immediately
     prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute an option to
     acquire, on the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such RJR
     Stock Option, the same number of shares of Reynolds American Common Stock
     (rounded down to the nearest whole share) as the holder of such RJR Stock
     Option would have been entitled to receive pursuant to the Merger had such
     holder exercised such RJR Stock Option in full
<PAGE>
                                                                              80


     immediately prior to the Effective Time, at a price per share (rounded up
     to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) the aggregate exercise price for
     the shares of RJR Common Stock otherwise purchasable pursuant to such RJR
     Stock Option divided by (B) the number of shares of Reynolds American
     Common Stock that such RJR Stock Option is deemed to constitute an option
     to acquire (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Option"); provided, however,
     that, any RJR Stock Option that is intended to be an "incentive stock
     option" (as defined in Section 422 of the Code), and that may not be
     adjusted in the foregoing manner and remain an incentive stock option,
     shall be adjusted in accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the
     Code in a manner that most closely produces the economic results obtained
     with respect to other Adjusted Options (it being understood that it is the
     intention of the parties that RJR Stock Options so assumed by Reynolds
     American qualify, to the maximum extent permissible following the Effective
     Time, as incentive stock options to the extent that such RJR Stock Options
     qualified as incentive stock options prior to the Effective Time);

         (ii) adjust the terms of all outstanding RJR SARs to provide that, at
     the Effective Time, each RJR SAR outstanding immediately prior to the
     Effective Time shall be deemed to constitute a right to receive an SAR, on
     the same terms and conditions as were applicable under such RJR SAR,
     denominated in shares of Reynolds American Common Stock (each, as so
     adjusted, an "Adjusted SAR") that shall represent a right to receive, the
     excess of (a) the fair market value of a share of Reynolds American Common
     Stock on the date of exercise over (b) the base value of the Adjusted SAR;

         (iii) adjust the terms of all outstanding RJR Stock Deferred Stock
     Units to provide that, at the Effective Time, each RJR Stock Deferred Stock
     Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to
     constitute a right to receive a deferred stock unit, on the same terms and
     conditions as were applicable under such RJR Stock Deferred Stock
     Unit,(each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Stock Deferred Stock Unit"), that
     is equal in value to one share of Reynolds American Common Stock;
<PAGE>
                                                                              81



         (iv) adjust the terms of all outstanding RJR Cash Deferred Stock Units
     to provide that, at the Effective Time, each RJR Cash Deferred Stock Unit
     outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be deemed to
     constitute a right to receive a deferred stock unit, on the same terms and
     conditions as were applicable under such RJR Cash Deferred Stock Unit
     (each, as so adjusted, an "Adjusted Cash Deferred Stock Unit"), that is
     equal in value to one share of Reynolds American Common Stock;

         (v) make such other changes to the RJR Stock Plans as RJR and B&W may
     agree are appropriate to give effect to the Merger;

         (vi) take such action as necessary under the RJR Stock Plans to ensure
     that all restrictions or limitations on transfer and vesting and all
     repurchase rights with respect to the RJR Stock Options, RJR SARs, RJR
     Stock Deferred Stock Units, RJR Cash Deferred Stock Units, RJR Director
     Deferrals and RJR Director Grants and RJR Restricted Shares, to the extent
     that such restrictions or limitations shall not have already lapsed, and
     all other terms thereof, shall remain in full force and effect pursuant to
     their terms with respect to the corresponding Adjusted Options, Adjusted
     SARs, Adjusted Stock Deferred Stock Units and Adjusted Cash Deferred Stock
     Units and shares of Reynolds American Common Stock after giving effect to
     the Merger and the assumption of the RJR Stock Plans by Reynolds American
     as set forth below; and

         (vii) ensure that, after the Effective Time, no RJR Stock Options, RJR
     SARs, RJR Director Deferrals, RJR Director Grants, RJR Stock Deferred Stock
     Units and RJR Cash Deferred Stock Units may be granted or deferred under
     any RJR Stock Plan.

         (b) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without the need
of any further corporate action, Reynolds American shall assume the RJR Stock
Plans, with the result that all the obligations of RJR under the RJR Stock
Plans, each outstanding Adjusted Option, Adjusted SARs, Adjusted Cash Deferred
Stock Units and Adjusted Stock Deferred Stock Units and the agreements
evidencing the grants thereof shall be obligations of Reynolds American
following the Effective Time. As soon as practicable after
<PAGE>
                                                                              82


the Effective Time, Reynolds American shall deliver to the holders of Adjusted
Options, Adjusted SARs, Adjusted Stock Deferred Stock Units and Adjusted Cash
Deferred Stock Units appropriate notices setting forth such holders' rights
pursuant to the respective RJR Stock Plans and the agreements evidencing the
grants of such Adjusted Options, Adjusted SARs, Adjusted Stock Deferred Stock
Units and Adjusted Cash Deferred Stock Units and that such Adjusted Options,
Adjusted SARs, Adjusted Stock Deferred Stock Units and Adjusted Cash Deferred
Stock Units and agreements shall be assumed by Reynolds American and shall
continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the adjustments
required by this Section 6.04 after giving effect to the Merger).

         (c) Reynolds American shall take all corporate action necessary to
reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Reynolds American Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options assumed in accordance
with this Section 6.04. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective
Time, Reynolds American shall file a registration statement on Form S-8 (or any
successor or other appropriate form) registering a number of shares of Reynolds
American Common Stock subject to such Adjusted Options and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or prospectuses
required thereby) for so long as any Adjusted Options remain outstanding. Prior
to the Effective Time, RJR shall take, and shall cause Reynolds American to
take, all actions as may be reasonably required to cause the transactions
contemplated by this Section 6.04 and any other acquisition of equity securities
of Reynolds American or disposition of equity securities of RJR (including
derivative Securities) by any person who is or a director or officer of RJR or
who is or will become a director or officer of Reynolds American to be exempt
under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

account, denominated in shares of RJR Common Stock, to receive payment in cash

                  "RJR Director Grants" means any grant of stock options, stock
         awards or deferred stock units to purchase or receive RJR Common Stock
         made to a director of the RJR Board pursuant to the terms of the Equity
         Incentive Award Plan for Directors of RJR and Subsidiaries.

                  "RJR SAR" means any stock appreciation right to receive in
         cash, RJR Common Stock or a combination thereof, the excess of (i) the

         granted under any RJR Stock Plan or otherwise multiplied by (iii) the

         of RJR.

                  "RJR Stock Option" means any option or right to purchase RJR

result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in

in the B&W Opco Formation Agreement.

         (b) Reynolds American agrees that (i) the employees of B&W Opco and
each subsidiary of B&W Opco immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"Affected B&W Employees") who remain employed by Reynolds American and its

commencing upon the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and ending 18 months thereafter
with respect to those Affected B&W Employees employed immediately prior to the
Effective Time at the locations set forth on Section 6.05(b) of the B&W
Disclosure Letter (provided, however, that with respect to welfare benefits,
such period shall end no later than December 31, 2005)and (B) the period
commencing upon the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and ending on the first
anniversary thereof with respect to all other Affected B&W Employees and (ii)

Reynolds American and its subsidiaries during the period he or she is covered
under clause (i) of this Section 6.05(b) is added to his or her eligible service
prior to the Closing Date) to receive a benefit under a retirement or retiree

and at times required by such plans as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

         (c) Reynolds American agrees that (i) for all purposes (including
eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under the employee benefit plans of

(ii) any early retirement subsidies, eligibilities and features under any B&W
Benefit Plan which cover Affected B&W Employees as of the Closing Date shall

Closing Date (or who would be eligible at the Closing Date if his or her age
and/or eligible service as of the Closing Date was combined with his or her
additional age and active service with Reynolds American and its subsidiaries
following the Closing Date), in each case, except for purposes of benefit
accrual under defined benefit pension plans to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of accrued benefits in respect of the same period of
service. Following the B&W Opco Stock Contribution, Reynolds American shall, or
shall cause its subsidiaries to, (A) waive any pre-existing conditions,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare
benefit plan maintained by Reynolds American or any of its subsidiaries in which

B&W welfare benefit plans immediately prior to the B&W Opco Stock Contribution),
and (B) provide each Affected B&W Employee with credit for any co-payments and

as contemplated by Section 6.05(e) of the B&W Disclosure Letter.

         (f) Except to the extent any such actions shall require consent of
participants in RJR Benefit Plans or any employee who is a party to a RJR
Benefit Agreement, RJR has taken all action necessary to provide that none of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions contemplated hereby shall be treated as a "change in
control", "change of control" or similar concept under the RJR Stock Plans, any
other RJR Benefit Plans or the RJR Benefit Agreements (including the RJR Master
Trust and the RJR Excess Benefit Master Trust underlying the RJR Benefit Plans
and RJR Benefit Agreements).

         (g) Except to the extent any such actions shall require consent of
participants in B&W Benefit Plans or any employee who is a party to a B&W
Benefit Agreement, B&W has taken all action necessary to provide that none of
the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger and
the other Transactions contemplated hereby shall be treated as a "change in
control", "change of control" or similar concept under the B&W Benefit Plans or
the B&W Benefit Agreements.

         SECTION 6.06. Indemnification. (a) Reynolds American shall, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, cause the Surviving Corporation to honor all
RJR's obligations to indemnify (including any obligations to advance funds for
expenses) the current or former directors or officers of RJR for acts or
omissions by such directors and officers occurring prior to the Effective Time
to the extent that such obligations of RJR exist on the date of this Agreement,
whether pursuant to the RJR Charter, RJR By-Laws or individual indemnity
agreements or otherwise, and such obligations shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with the terms of the RJR
Charter, the RJR By-Laws and such individual indemnity agreements from the
Effective Time until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations
with respect to any claims against such directors and officers arising out of
such acts or omissions.

         (b) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Reynolds
American shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of
directors' and
<PAGE>
                                                                              87


officers' liability insurance maintained by RJR (provided that Reynolds American
may substitute therefor policies with reputable and financially sound carriers
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which
are no less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to
facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; provided,
however, that Reynolds American shall not be obligated to make annual premium
payments for such insurance to the extent such premiums exceed 200% of the
annual premiums paid as of the date of this Agreement by RJR for such insurance
(such 200% amount, the "Maximum Premium"). If such insurance coverage cannot be
obtained at all, or can only be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the
Maximum Premium, Reynolds American shall maintain the most advantageous policies
of directors' and officers' insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal to
the Maximum Premium.

         SECTION 6.07. Fees and Expenses. (a) Except as provided below, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Merger is consummated, except that each of RJR and B&W shall bear and pay
one-half of (1) the filing fees for the HSR Filing and the EC Filings, if any,
and (2) the costs and expenses incurred in connection with the filing, printing
and mailing of the Form S-4 and the Proxy Statement if the Closing shall not
occur (for whatever reason).

         (b) In the event that (i) (A) a RJR Takeover Proposal has been made or
made known to RJR or its stockholders after the date of this Agreement (whether
or not conditional and whether or not withdrawn), (B) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by either B&W or RJR pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i) (but only if
the RJR Stockholders Meeting has not been held by the date that is five business
days prior to the date of such termination) or Section 8.01(b)(iii) and (C)
within 12 months after such termination, RJR or any of its subsidiaries enters
into any RJR Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to, or consummates,
any RJR Takeover Proposal (solely for purposes of this Section 6.07(b)(i)(C),
the term "RJR Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning set forth in the
definition of RJR Takeover Proposal contained in Section 5.02(e) except that all
references in such

                                                                              88


definition to 20% shall be deemed references to 40%), (ii) this Agreement is
terminated by B&W pursuant to Section 8.01(d) or (iii) this Agreement is
terminated by RJR pursuant to Section 8.01(f), then, in each case, RJR shall pay
B&W a fee equal to $130,000,000 (the "RJR Termination Fee") by wire transfer of
same day funds to an account designated by B&W (x) in the case of a termination
by RJR pursuant to Section 8.01(f), prior to or simultaneously with such
termination, (y) in the case of a termination by B&W pursuant to Section
8.01(d), within two business days after such termination and (z) in the case of
a payment as a result of Section 6.07(b)(i), upon the occurrence of an event set
forth in Section 6.07(b)(i)(C). RJR acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this Section 6.07(b) are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, B&W would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if RJR fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to
this Section 6.07(b) and, in order to obtain such payment, B&W commences a suit
that results in a judgment against RJR for the amounts set forth in this Section
6.07(b), RJR shall pay to B&W interest on the amounts set forth in this Section
6.07(b) at a rate per annum equal to three-month LIBOR (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal (Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein, in another
authoritative source selected by B&W) on the date such payment was required to
be made (or if no quotation for three-month LIBOR is available for such date, on
the next preceding date for which such a quotation is available) plus 1.5%.

         (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by B&W pursuant to
Section 8.01(g), then B&W shall pay RJR a fee equal to $130,000,000 (the "B&W
Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
RJR prior to or simultaneously with such termination. B&W acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 6.07(c) are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and that, without these agreements,
RJR would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if B&W fails promptly to
pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 6.07(c) and, in order to obtain
such payment, RJR commences a suit that results in a judgment against B&W for
the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(c), B&W shall pay to RJR interest on
the amounts set forth in this Section 6.07(c) at a rate per annum equal to
three-month LIBOR (as reported in The Wall

authoritative source selected by RJR) on the date such payment was required to
be made (or if no quotation for three-month LIBOR is available for such date, on
the next preceding date for which such a quotation is available) plus 1.5%.

         SECTION 6.08. Public Announcements. B&W and RJR shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to this
Agreement, the Merger and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such
press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation,
except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with, or rules of, any securities exchange or
listing authority.

         SECTION 6.09. Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Asset Contribution and Assumption of Liabilities shall be
paid by B&W, and Reynolds American shall cooperate with B&W in preparing,
executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes. All
other Transfer Taxes incurred in connection with the Transactions shall be paid
by Reynolds American.

         SECTION 6.10. Affiliates. Promptly following the date of execution of
this Agreement, RJR shall deliver to B&W a letter identifying all persons who
are expected by RJR to be, at the date of the RJR Stockholders Meeting,
"affiliates" of RJR for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. RJR shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause each such person to deliver to Reynolds
American on or prior to the Effective Time a written agreement substantially in
the form attached as Exhibit I.

         SECTION 6.11. Stock Exchange Listing. RJR and Reynolds American shall
use their reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Reynolds American
Common Stock to be issued in the Share Issuance to be approved for listing on
the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, on or prior to the Closing
Date.

                                                                              90



         SECTION 6.12. Rights Agreements; Consequences if Rights Triggered. (a)
The RJR Board shall take all action requested in writing by B&W in order to
render the RJR Rights inapplicable to the Merger and the other Transactions and
to terminate the RJR Rights Agreement at the Effective Time. Except as approved
in writing by B&W, the RJR Board shall not (i) amend the RJR Rights Agreement,
(ii) redeem any RJR Rights or (iii) take any action with respect to, or make any
determination under, the RJR Rights Agreement in respect of any person (other
than B&W or any of its affiliates) becoming an Acquiring Person unless the RJR
Board or a committee thereof determines in good faith (after consultation with
outside legal counsel and after compliance with all applicable provisions of
this Agreement) that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law. If any Distribution Date, Triggering
Event, Section 11(a)(ii) Event, Section 13 Event or Stock Acquisition Date (in
each case, as defined in the RJR Rights Agreement) occurs under the RJR Rights
Agreement at any time during the period from the date of this Agreement to the
Effective Time, RJR and B&W shall make such adjustments to the Exchange Ratio as
RJR and B&W shall mutually agree so as to preserve the economic benefits that
RJR and B&W each reasonably expected on the date of this Agreement to receive as
a result of the consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions.

         (b) Prior to the Effective Time, each of RJR and B&W shall take all
action necessary to cause Reynolds American to adopt the Reynolds American
Rights Plan in the form attached as Exhibit C.

         SECTION 6.13. Tax Matters. (a) The parties intend the Asset
Contribution and the Assumption of Liabilities, on the one hand, and the B&W
Opco Stock Contribution and the Merger, on the other hand, to qualify as
exchanges under Section 351 of the Code and intend the Merger also to qualify as
a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. The parties further intend
that the SF Contribution qualify as an exchange within the meaning of Section
351 of the Code and also as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. Each of B&W and RJR shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the Asset Contribution and Assumption of Liabilities, on the one hand, and
the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the Merger, on the other hand, to so
<PAGE>
                                                                             91


qualify and to obtain the Tax Rulings. None of B&W, RJR or their respective
affiliates shall take any action or shall fail to take any action or suffer to
exist any condition which action or failure to act or condition would prevent,
or would be reasonably likely to prevent, (i) the Asset Contribution and
Assumption of Liabilities, on the one hand, and the B&W Opco Stock Contribution
and the Merger, on the other hand, from qualifying as exchanges within the
meaning of Section 351 of the Code and, in the case of the Merger, as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and (ii) the SF
Contribution from qualifying as an exchange within the meaning of Section 351
of the Code and also as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)
of the Code. The parties agree to act jointly and by mutual agreement in all
matters relating to seeking and obtaining the B&W Tax Ruling and the RJR Tax
Ruling (collectively, the "Tax Rulings"), including (A) to jointly submit to
the IRS a "pre-submission conference" memorandum and to hold a joint
pre-submission conference with the IRS to discuss the proposed Tax Rulings, (B)
to file either a joint or substantially identical statements of fact for the
Tax Rulings, (C) to submit to the IRS in connection with the Tax Rulings a
statement of the business purpose of the Transactions as mutually agreed by the
parties, (D) to file mutually agreed requests for the B&W Tax Ruling and the
RJR Tax Ruling, (E) not to conduct any conferences, meetings or other
communications with the IRS regarding the Tax Rulings without the presence of
the other party and/or its counsel and (F) to jointly provide additional
information requested by the IRS only after incorporating all reasonable
changes and comments of both parties.

                  (b)      Any Tax sharing agreement between B&W and any B&W
Subsidiary shall be terminated as of the Closing. After the Closing, no party
shall have any rights or obligations under any such Tax sharing agreement.

                  (c)      Reynolds American shall file all Tax Returns of any
B&W Subsidiary relating to Taxes measured with respect to taxable periods that
begin before the Closing and end after the Closing, provided, however, that
such Tax Returns shall be filed on a basis consistent with such B&W
Subsidiary's past practices and Reynolds American shall not file any such Tax
Return without the prior written consent of B&W, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld.

                  SECTION 6.14. Intercompany Accounts. B&W shall cause all
receivables, payables, accounts and indebtedness (other than trade receivables
and trade payables) between any B&W Subsidiary, on the one hand, and BAT or any
of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, to be satisfied or eliminated prior to
the Closing, and all arrangements related to such receivables, payables,
accounts and indebtedness (other than trade receivables and trade payables)
shall be terminated with respect to the B&W Subsidiaries.

                  SECTION 6.15. Post-Effective Time Intercompany Agreements.
Following the Effective Time, Reynolds American may terminate, without penalty
or further obligation, any Contract (other than any Transaction Agreement and
other than any Contract relating to a trade payable or trade receivable) that
is contributed to B&W Opco entered into prior to the Effective Time between B&W
or any of its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and BAT and one of its
subsidiaries, on the other hand, if such Contract is not disclosed in Section
4.17(a)(ix) of the B&W Disclosure Letter.

                  SECTION 6.16. Post-Effective Time Merger. Immediately
following the Effective Time, Reynolds American shall cause RJR-T to be merged
with and into B&W Opco, with B&W Opco as the surviving corporation, on terms
and conditions reasonably satisfactory to B&W and RJR.

                  SECTION 6.17. Satisfaction of Macon Bonds. Prior to the
Effective Time, B&W shall cause the redemption and full satisfaction of all
obligations of B&W arising out of or in connection with (a) the Macon Bibb
Industrial Authority Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bonds (B&W) Series
1993A and (b) the Macon Bibb Industrial Authority Taxable Industrial
Development Revenue Bonds (B&W), Series 1993B. In connection with the
redemption of such bonds, B&W shall take all action necessary and proper to
cause the termination of each of the agreements relating to such bonds.

                  SECTION 6.18. Further Assurances. In the event that after the
Effective Time, any property, asset or right that was used primarily, or held
for use primarily, in the B&W Business prior to the Effective Time (other than
an Excluded Asset) has not been transferred to B&W Opco pursuant to the B&W
Opco Formation Agreement, B&W shall take all such actions as are necessary to
cause such
<PAGE>
                                                                             93


property, asset or right, as the case may be, to be transferred to B&W Opco
without the payment of additional consideration.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                              Conditions Precedent

                  SECTION 7.01. Conditions to Each Party's Obligations. The
respective obligation of each party to effect each Transaction is subject to
the satisfaction or, to the extent legally permissible, waiver on or prior to
the Closing Date of the following conditions:

                  (a)      Stockholder Approval. RJR Stockholder Approval shall

competent jurisdiction (collectively, "Restraints") shall be in effect
preventing the consummation of the Transactions.

                  (e)      Form S-4. The Form S-4 shall have become effective

Transactions shall have been satisfied (or waived by the party entitled to the

                  SECTION 7.02. Conditions to Obligations of B&W. The
obligations of B&W to effect each Transaction are further subject to the
following conditions:

                  (a)      Representations and Warranties. The representations
and warranties of RJR (i) in Section 3.03 and Section 3.17(a)(viii) and in the
Lane Stock Purchase Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects and (ii) in this Agreement (other than Section 3.03 and Section
3.17(a)(viii)) shall be true and correct, other than for such failures in this
clause (ii) to be true and correct (ignoring for such purposes any materiality
or material adverse effect qualifiers therein) that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a RJR Material
Adverse Effect, in the case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), as
of the date of this Agreement. B&W shall have received a certificate signed on
behalf of RJR by the chief financial officer of RJR to such effect.

                  (b)      Performance of Obligations of RJR. RJR shall have

contemplated by this Agreement, which ruling is reasonably acceptable to B&W,
to the effect that, based on the facts and representations provided in the
request for the B&W Tax Ruling, (i) the Asset Contribution and the Assumption
of Liabilities, on the one hand, and the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the
Merger, on the other hand, each will be treated for federal income tax purposes
as an exchange described in Section 351 of the Code, (ii) B&W will not
recognize any gain for U.S. Federal income tax purposes as a result of the
Asset Contribution and Assumption of Liabilities or the B&W Opco Stock

368(a) reorganization, provided that in the absence of such a ruling regarding
the Post-Effective Time Contribution and Merger, B&W shall have received an
opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP to the same effect, dated the Closing
Date, which opinion is reasonably acceptable to B&W, and in rendering such
opinion Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP shall be entitled to rely on the facts and
representations provided in the request for the B&W Tax Ruling.

                  SECTION 7.03. Conditions to Obligations of RJR. The

Lane Seller and CMS in the Lane Stock Purchase Agreement shall be true and
correct, other than for such failures in the foregoing clauses (i)(B) and (ii)
to be true and correct (ignoring for such purposes any materiality or material
adverse effect qualifiers therein) that, individually or in the aggregate, have
not and are not reasonably likely to have a B&W Material Adverse Effect, in the
case of each of the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), as of the date of this
Agreement. RJR shall have received a certificate signed on behalf of B&W and
Lane by
<PAGE>
                                                                             96


the chief financial officers of B&W and Lane to such effect.

                  (b)      Performance of Obligations of B&W. B&W shall have
performed in all material respects all material obligations required to be
performed by it under this Agreement that are required to be performed at or

ruling from the IRS (the "RJR Tax Ruling") regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which ruling is reasonably acceptable to RJR,
to the effect that, based on the facts and representations provided in the
request for the RJR Tax Ruling, (i) the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the
Merger will be treated for federal income tax purposes as an exchange described
in Section 351 of the Code, (ii) the Lane Stock Sale will not be treated as a
transaction resulting in a Section 301 distribution and (iii) either (x) a
similar ruling that the Merger will also be treated as a reorganization within
the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (y) an opinion of Jones Day, dated
the Closing Date, which opinion is reasonably acceptable to RJR, that the
Merger will also be treated as a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and in rendering such opinion Jones Day shall be entitled
to rely on the facts and representations provided in the request for the RJR
Tax Ruling. The RJR Tax Ruling shall also be to the effect that the
Post-Effective Time Contribution and Merger will be treated as a Section 351
exchange followed by a Section 368(a) reorganization, provided that in the
absence of such ruling, RJR shall have received an opinion of Jones Day to the
same effect, dated the Closing Date, which opinion is reasonably acceptable to
RJR, and in rendering such opinion Jones Day shall be entitled to rely on the
facts and representations provided in the request for the RJR Tax Ruling.

                  SECTION 7.04. Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither RJR
nor B&W may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.01,
7.02 or 7.03 to be satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's failure
to act in good faith and to use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the
Merger and the other Transactions, as required by and subject to Section 6.03.

breach (provided that B&W is not then in material breach of any representation,

in effect on the date of this Agreement) and a Distribution Date, Triggering
Event, Section 11(a)(ii) Event, Section 13 Event or Stock Acquisition Date (in
each case, as defined in the RJR Rights Agreement as in effect on the date of

                  (e)      by RJR, if B&W breaches or fails to perform in any

this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of B&W or RJR, other than the provisions of
Section 3.18, Section 4.18, the last sentence of Section 6.02(a), Section 6.07,
Section 6.08, this Section 8.02 and Article IX, which provisions shall survive
such termination. Nothing in this Section 8.02 shall be deemed to release any
party from any liability for any wilful and material breach by such party of
the terms and provisions of this Agreement or to impair the right of any party
to compel specific performance by any other party of its obligations under this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time before or after receipt of the RJR Stockholder Approval;

behalf of each of the parties.

                  SECTION 8.04. Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, the parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any
of the obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement
or in any document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance
with any of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement; provided,
however, that after receipt of the RJR Stockholder Approval, there shall be no
waiver that by Law requires further approval by the stockholders of RJR without
the further approval of such stockholders. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor shall any single or partial
exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its rights under this
<PAGE>
                                                                            100


Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other
rights under this Agreement.

or Waiver. A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an
amendment of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver
pursuant to Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case
of B&W or RJR, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized designee
of its Board of Directors.

only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "herein", "hereto" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is
not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the

reasonable and prudent individual to determine the existence of such fact or
matter. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the

                  SECTION 9.05. Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule
or Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end
that the Transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

                  SECTION 9.06. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in

the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto. Any purported
assignment without such prior written consent shall be void. Subject to the
preceding sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon,

inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 9.10. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to
submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the
State of Delaware or Chancery Court of the State of Delaware in the event any
dispute arises out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it
will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, (c) irrevocably and
unconditionally waives (and agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the
laying of venue of any action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement
or any Transaction, (d) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any Transaction in any court other than any Federal court
sitting in the State of Delaware or Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and
(e) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction.

         SECTION 2.04. Working Capital Adjustment.

         (a) As soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement
(but in no event later than 60 calendar days after the date of this Agreement),
B&W Opco will cause to be prepared and delivered to B&W an unaudited
consolidated balance sheet of B&W Opco and its Subsidiaries as of the date of
this Agreement, after giving effect to the Asset Contribution and the Assumption
of Liabilities but prior to giving effect to the B&W Opco Stock Contribution
(such time being referred to as the "Measurement Time"), together with a
statement of each component of Working Capital of B&W Opco as of the Measurement
Time (the "Working Capital Statement"). The Working Capital Statement will be
prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles, policies, practices
and procedures used to prepare the amounts set forth on Schedule 1.01(e), which
are the same accounting principles, policies, practices and procedures used to
prepare the B&W Audited Historical Financial Statements (as defined in the
Combination Agreement), except that inventory is valued on a FIFO basis (the
"B&W Accounting Policies"). B&W will have the right to audit the worksheets,
examine underlying records and review any work papers relating to the Working
Capital Statement.

         (b) If B&W disagrees with the Working Capital Statement, B&W must,
within 20 business days after delivery of the Working Capital Statement to B&W,
notify B&W Opco in writing as to whether B&W accepts the Working Capital
Statement. If B&W notifies B&W Opco that it does not accept the Working Capital
Statement (the "Notice of Dispute"), B&W will set out each disputed item, the
amount in dispute and its reasons for such dispute in reasonable detail,
including any adjustments which, in B&W's opinion, should be made to the Working
Capital Statement in order to comply with the requirements of this Section 2.04.
After delivery of the Notice of Dispute, B&W may not introduce additional
disagreements with respect to any item in the Working Capital Statement. If a
Notice of Dispute is
<PAGE>
received by B&W Opco in accordance with this Section 2.04(b), B&W and B&W Opco
will use all reasonable efforts to meet and resolve the objections of B&W to the
Working Capital Statement within 60 calendar days of B&W Opco's receipt of the
Notice of Dispute (the "Negotiation Period").

         (c) If B&W and B&W Opco do not reach agreement prior to expiration of
the Negotiation Period, then B&W and B&W Opco will each deliver to the Atlanta
office of Ernst & Young LLP or such other accounting firm as the parties shall
jointly agree (the "Independent Firm") a written notice (a "Submission Notice")
specifying the nature and value of all items remaining in dispute within ten
calendar days following the expiration of the Negotiation Period. B&W and B&W
Opco will be deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts contained in the
Working Capital Statement other than the disputed items in each Submission
Notice.

         (d) The Independent Firm will (i) make an examination of the Working
Capital Statement, (ii) inspect and examine each party's working papers, (iii)
schedule meetings at which each party may present supporting data and arguments
to substantiate its position and (iv) after giving each party an opportunity to
rebut the other party's data and arguments, decide all disputed items set forth
in each Submission Notice. B&W Opco and B&W will instruct, and will use their
reasonable best efforts to cause, the Independent Firm to determine and report
to B&W and B&W Opco in writing upon all disputed items included in the
Submission Notices within 90 calendar days following the delivery of such
Submission Notices to the Independent Firm in accordance with this Section 2.04,
and such report will be final, binding and conclusive on B&W and B&W Opco. The
Independent Firm's determination will be accompanied by a certificate of the
Independent Firm that it reached its decision in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 2.04. The Independent Firm will not have the authority to review
or make a determination with respect to any matter except the disputed items
included in each Submission Notice, it being understood that the Independent
Firm will not conduct its own independent audit or review, but rather will only
resolve specific differences between B&W and B&W Opco and make a determination
within the range of such differences as set forth in each Submission Notice. In
resolving such differences, the Independent Firm may not
<PAGE>
assign a value to an item greater than the greatest value claimed by any party
or less than the smallest value for such item claimed by any party in the
Submission Notice. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Firm will be
allocated equally between B&W and B&W Opco. In acting under this Agreement, the
Independent Firm will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of
arbitrators. The Working Capital Statement will be deemed final, binding and
conclusive on the parties hereto for the purposes of this Section 2.04 upon the
earliest of (A) the failure of B&W to deliver a Notice of Dispute to B&W Opco
pursuant to Section 2.04(b) within 20 business days of B&W Opco's delivery of
the Working Capital Statement to B&W, (B) the resolution of all disputes by B&W
and B&W Opco in accordance with this Section 2.04, (C) the failure by B&W to
deliver a Submission Notice to the Independent Firm in accordance with Section
2.04(c) (provided B&W Opco has delivered a Submission Notice in accordance with
Section 2.04(c)) or (D) the resolution of all the disputed items set forth in
the Submission Notice by the Independent Firm. The Working Capital Statement, as
modified by all adjustments provided for in the Notice of Dispute, will be
deemed final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto for the purpose of
this Section 2.04 upon failure of B&W Opco to deliver a Submission Notice to the
Independent Firm in accordance with Section 2.04(c) (provided B&W has delivered
a Submission Notice in accordance with Section 2.04(c)). B&W and B&W Opco will
each permit the other party, its agents and the Independent Firm reasonable
access during normal business hours, and on reasonable notice, to all relevant
books and records, computer files, premises and personnel involved in the
preparation of the underlying records and operating systems which generated the
information used in the preparation of the Working Capital Statement, the Notice
of Dispute and the Submission Notice and will permit them to take copies of such
accounts, documents and records at their own expense.

         (e) Within five business days of the Working Capital Statement being
deemed final, if the Working Capital of B&W Opco as of the Measurement Time (as
finally determined) is less than the Minimum Required Working Capital Amount as
of the Measurement Time, B&W shall pay to B&W Opco an amount equal to (i) such
Minimum Required Working Capital Amount less such Working Capital plus (ii)
interest on such difference from the date of this Agreement to the date of such
payment at a rate per annum
<PAGE>
equal to (A) three-month LIBOR (as reported in The Wall Street Journal
(Northeast edition) or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source
acceptable to B&W and B&W Opco) on the date of this Agreement (or if no
quotation for three-month LIBOR is available for such date, on the next
preceding date for which such a quotation is available) plus (B) 1.5%.

         SECTION 2.05. License of B&W Trademark. From the date of this Agreement

the form and style in which it was used on the B&W Packaging as of the date of
this Agreement (whether alone or in combination with other trademarks) on B&W
Packaging, provided that any such products manufactured by B&W Opco are
manufactured, in all material respects, at the same quality standards maintained
by B&W prior to the Effective Time. Any B&W Packaging not used within the
aforesaid license period shall not thereafter be used by B&W Opco and will be
destroyed at B&W Opco's sole expense unless otherwise agreed to by B&W in
writing.

         SECTION 2.06. Transition Support Services. (a) B&W and its affiliates
shall provide B&W Opco with the services described on Schedule 2.06(a) (the "B&W
Services") for the transitional period set forth on such Schedule(1); provided,
however, B&W and its affiliates shall not be obligated to perform any such B&W
Service if and to the extent that such B&W Service (i) has not historically been

Services. Any such information shall be provided by B&W Opco at the same times

Opco shall be responsible for assuring that such information is accurate and
complete. B&W's performance of any B&W Service may be suspended during any
period that B&W Opco fails to provide such information and assistance to the
extent such failure renders performance of such B&W Service by B&W unduly
burdensome. B&W shall not be liable to B&W Opco for any Indemnifiable Losses in
respect of providing any B&W Service absent gross negligence or wilful
misconduct.

         (b) B&W Opco and its Subsidiaries shall provide B&W and its affiliates
with the services described on Schedule 2.06(b) (the "B&W Opco Services") for
the transitional period set forth on such Schedule(2); provided, however, B&W

Service if and to the extent that such B&W Opco Service (i) has not been
historically provided to B&W in the ordinary course of the B&W Business, or in a

B&W and its affiliates prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) would require
B&W Opco to hire any additional personnel or make any capital expenditures,
(iii) is for any operations of a person other than B&W or any of its affiliates
or (iv) would breach any contract to which B&W Opco is a party or violate any
applicable law to which B&W Opco is subject. B&W will reimburse B&W Opco for the
B&W Opco Services at B&W Opco's fully-allocated costs. During the period in
which the respective Services are being provided, B&W shall furnish B&W Opco
with such information and other reasonable assistance as is necessary to enable
B&W Opco to perform the B&W Opco Services. Any such information shall be
provided by B&W at the same times and in the same format as previously supplied.
B&W shall be responsible for assuring that such information is accurate and
complete. B&W Opco's performance of any B&W Opco Service may be suspended during

(2) Schedule to be prepared prior to Closing.
<PAGE>
any period that B&W fails to provide such information and assistance to the
extent such failure renders performance of such B&W Opco Service by B&W Opco
unduly burdensome. B&W Opco shall not be liable to B&W for any Indemnifiable
Losses in respect of providing any B&W Opco Service absent gross negligence or
wilful misconduct.

         SECTION 2.07. Further Assurances. On and after the effectiveness of

Tax purposes to the extent provided by applicable law. If B&W Opco receives a
refund or credit or accrues an offset to Tax relating to Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, B&W Opco shall pay to B&W within 20 days of such receipt or accrual the
amount of such refund, credit or offset to Tax.

Opco agree to take or cause to be taken such actions as are reasonably
practicable (including the assumption, if necessary, of Liabilities relating to
the employment of Employees) such that the employment of the Employees will
transfer to B&W Opco at such time (the "Employment Transfer Time"). B&W Opco
shall offer to employ and continue the employment of each Employee at the same
salary and wages payable by B&W and the Included Subsidiaries to such Employee
immediately prior to the Employment Transfer Time and shall maintain terms and
conditions of employment which replicate those provided by B&W and the Included
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Employment Transfer Time as and to the

or in
<PAGE>
connection with B&W Opco's failure to offer employment to, or continue the
employment of, any Employee, or failure to offer or continue employment on terms
and conditions which would preclude any claims of constructive dismissal or
similar claims under any applicable Law or other failure to comply with the
terms of this Agreement, or where any such severance or termination benefits are
automatically required to be paid under applicable Law.

Time, B&W Opco shall adopt as the successor plan sponsor, all B&W Benefit Plans
(and, as applicable, any related trusts) and shall assume all of B&W's rights
under such related trusts and all of B&W's Liabilities under the B&W Benefit
Plans (other than Excluded Liabilities), and B&W and B&W Opco shall take all
action reasonably required to effect such adoption and assumption as of the
Employment Transfer Time. Following such adoption and assumption, PLC and its
Subsidiaries shall have no further Liabilities of any kind or description under
the B&W Benefit Plans or their related trusts (except for Excluded Liabilities).

         Assumed Liabilities (including the failure by B&W Opco to pay, perform
         or otherwise discharge any of the Assumed Liabilities in accordance
         with their terms), whether such Indemnifiable Losses relate to or arise

         Assumption of Liabilities; provided, however, that with respect to
         Indemnifiable Losses relating to or arising from events, occurrences,
         facts or circumstances relating to or arising from actions or omissions

         Asset or (ii) any action taken by B&W with respect to such
         Non-Assignable Assets outside the ordinary course of business or that
         is finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to result
         from the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of B&W;

                  (c) relating to or arising from any untrue or allegedly untrue
         statement of a material fact contained in, or incorporated by reference
         to, any of the Filings or any omission to state therein a material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading, but in each case not with respect to statements made
         therein or incorporated by reference therein based upon information
         supplied in writing by B&W specifically for inclusion or incorporation
         by reference therein; provided, however, that the indemnification
         provided for in this clause (c) shall only apply to Third Party Claims;
         or

                  (d) the aggregate MSA Liability Amount due and payable with
         respect to any period prior to the date of this Agreement and paid by a
         B&W Opco Indemnitee on or after such time is less than the Estimated
         MSA Liability Amount, with any such payment or payments being made
         promptly following the finalization of the various components thereof;
         provided, however, that any reduction in such MSA Liability Amount
         resulting from any Non-Participating
<PAGE>
         Manufacturer's adjustment shall not be considered for purposes of this
         Section 5.01(d).

         SECTION 5.02. Indemnification by B&W. Subject to the provisions of this
Article V, from and after the effectiveness of the Asset Contribution and the
Assumption of Liabilities, B&W shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the B&W
Opco Indemnitees from and against, and pay or reimburse the B&W Opco Indemnitees
for, all Indemnifiable Losses, as incurred, to the extent:

                  (a) relating to or arising from the Excluded Assets or the
         Excluded Liabilities (including the failure by B&W to pay, perform or
         otherwise discharge any of the Excluded Liabilities in accordance with
         their terms), whether such Indemnifiable Losses relate to or arise from
         events, occurrences, actions, omissions, facts or circumstances
         occurring, existing or asserted before, at or after the Asset
         Contribution and Assumption of Liabilities (other than Indemnifiable
         Losses that relate to or arise from the Non-Assignable Assets);

                  (b) relating to or arising from the Non-Assignable Assets with
         respect to such Indemnifiable Losses relating to or arising from
         events, occurrences, facts or circumstances relating to or arising from
         actions or omissions by B&W occurring after the Asset Contribution and
         Assumption of Liabilities that (i) are in conflict with any written
         instruction from B&W Opco with respect to such Non-Assignable Asset or
         (ii) are taken outside the ordinary course of business or are finally
         determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to result from the
         gross negligence or wilful misconduct of B&W;

                  (c) relating to or arising from any untrue statement of a
         material fact contained in, or incorporated by reference to, any of the
         Filings or any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
         fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
         misleading, but only with respect to statements made therein or
         incorporated by reference therein based upon information supplied in
         writing by B&W specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference
         therein; provided, however, that the
<PAGE>
         indemnification provided for in this clause (c) shall only apply to
         Third Party Claims; or

              (d) the aggregate MSA Liability Amount due and payable with
         respect to any period prior to the date of this Agreement and paid by a
         B&W Opco Indemnitee on or after the date of this Agreement is greater
         than the Estimated MSA Liability Amount, with any such payment or
         payments being made promptly following the finalization of the various
         components thereof.

         SECTION 5.03. Procedures Relating to Indemnification. (a) In order for
an Indemnitee to be entitled to any indemnification provided for under this
Agreement in respect of, arising out of or involving a claim made by any Person
who is not an Indemnitee against such Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"), such
Indemnitee must notify the party who may become obligated to provide
indemnification hereunder (the "Indemnifying Party") in writing, and in
reasonable detail, of the Third Party Claim reasonably promptly, and in any
event within 20 days after receipt by such Indemnitee of written notice of the
Third Party Claim; provided, however, that failure to give such notification
shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure; provided, further, however, that no such notice shall
need to be given by any B&W Indemnitee with respect to Third Party Claims
arising as a result of any Action pending as of the date of this Agreement.
After any required notification (if applicable), the Indemnitee shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly after the Indemnitee's receipt thereof, copies
of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnitee
relating to the Third Party Claim.

         (b) If a Third Party Claim is made against an Indemnitee, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense thereof and,
if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof (at the expense of the
Indemnifying Party) with counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party and
reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee; provided, however, that (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume such defense unless it first
acknowledges in writing its obligation hereunder to indemnify the Indemnitee
with respect to all material elements of such Third Party Claim and (ii) the
<PAGE>
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim if (but only to the extent that) the Indemnitee reasonably determines that
it has defenses, claims or positions that are unique, separate or distinct from
the defenses, claims or positions that might be available to other Persons
relating to such Third Party Claim (such as jurisdictional defenses). Except as
set forth below, should the Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable to the Indemnitee
for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection
with the defense thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes such defense, the
Indemnitee shall have the right to participate, at its own expense, in the
defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense, separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that the
Indemnifying Party shall control such defense; provided, however, that an
Indemnitee may reassume control of any defense if the Indemnitee reasonably
believes that the Indemnifying Party does not have the financial capability to
fully indemnify the Indemnitee for the Indemnifiable Losses that may be incurred
by the Indemnitee as a result of the applicable Third Party Claim or if the
Indemnifying Party fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such Third Party
Claim within 20 calendar days after receipt of written notice of such failure to
prosecute by the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
<PAGE>
employed by the Indemnitee (i) for any period during which the Indemnifying
Party has not assumed the defense thereof, (ii) as a result of the retention of
control pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of this Section 5.03(b) or
(iii) following the reassumption of control of any defense pursuant to the
proviso to the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume the defense of any Third
Party Claim if the Third Party Claim seeks an order, injunction or other
equitable relief or relief for other than money damages against the Indemnitee
which the Indemnitee reasonably determines cannot be separated from any related
claim for money damages. If such equitable or other relief portion of the Third
Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, the Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume the defense of the portion relating to money
damages and, in such event, the Indemnifying Party shall continue to be liable
for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel employed by the Indemnitee with
respect to the portion of the defense of such Third Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party has not assumed. The indemnification required by Section 5.01
or 5.02, as the case may be, shall be made by periodic payments of the amount
thereof during the course of the investigation or defense, as and when invoices
are received or the Indemnifiable Loss is incurred. If the Indemnifying Party
chooses to defend or prosecute a Third Party Claim (i) all the parties hereto
reasonably necessary or appropriate for such defense or prosecution shall
cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof, which cooperation shall include
the retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
such Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party shall keep the Indemnitee
reasonably informed of all significant developments in connection with the
defense or prosecution of such Third Party Claim and (iii) the Indemnitee shall
agree to any settlement, compromise or discharge of such Third Party Claim which
the Indemnifying Party may recommend (after representing to the Indemnitee that
such settlement is reasonably likely to be acceptable to the parties to the
Third Party Claim) and which by its terms obligates the Indemnifying Party to
pay the full amount of Liability of the Indemnitee in connection with such Third
Party Claim; provided, however, that, unless the Indemnitee in its sole
discretion otherwise consents in writing, the Indemnifying Party shall not
consent to entry of any Judgment or enter into any settlement (x) that provides
for injunctive or other nonmonetary relief affecting the Indemnitee or any of
its affiliates (other than the Indemnifying Party and its Subsidiaries) or their
respective properties or (y) that does not include as an unconditional term
thereof the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnitee of a release
from all Liability with respect to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party shall
have assumed the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall not admit
any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third
Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written consent.

         (c) In order for an Indemnitee to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this Agreement in respect of a claim that does not involve a
Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim (in
reasonably sufficient detail to enable the Indemnifying
<PAGE>
Party to evaluate such claim) with reasonable promptness to the Indemnifying
Party. The failure by any Indemnitee to give such notification shall not affect
the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a
result of such failure. If the Indemnifying Party has disputed its Liability
with respect to such claim the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnitee shall
proceed in good faith to negotiate a resolution of such dispute and, if not
resolved through negotiations, such dispute shall be resolved by litigation,
subject to the provisions of Section 6.09, in an appropriate court of competent
jurisdiction.

         SECTION 5.04. Certain Limitations. (a) The amount of any Indemnifiable
Losses or other Liability for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the Indemnitee from
third parties (including amounts actually recovered under insurance policies)
with respect to such Indemnifiable Losses. The Indemnitee shall use its
reasonable best efforts to seek to obtain recovery in respect of any
Indemnifiable Loss or such other Liability under any available insurance policy.

         (b) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated for all Tax purposes (i) as to the Indemnitee, as nontaxable
reimbursements or capital contributions, as the case may be, and (ii) as to the
Indemnifying Party, as deductible payments to the extent provided by applicable
law, unless, and then only to the extent, otherwise required by a Final
Determination. If an indemnification payment made pursuant to this Agreement is
treated as a taxable payment as a result of a Final Determination, such
indemnification payment shall be (i) reduced to take account of the present
value of any net Tax benefit actually realized by the Indemnitee in connection
with or otherwise arising from the incurrence of the applicable Indemnifiable
Loss and (ii) increased to take account of any net Tax cost incurred by the
Indemnitee as a result of the receipt of such indemnification payment (grossed
up for such increase).

         SECTION 5.05. Limitation on Transfer of B&W Opco Assets. (a) B&W Opco
shall not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease,
in one transaction or a series of transactions, directly or indirectly, all or
substantially all its assets to, any
<PAGE>
Person, unless the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor
Company") shall be a Person organized and existing under the laws of the United
States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the
Successor Company (if not B&W Opco) shall expressly assume all the obligations
of B&W Opco under this Agreement. Any such assumption shall be in writing and in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to B&W. For purposes of this Section
5.05(a), the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more
Subsidiaries of B&W Opco, which properties and assets, if held by B&W Opco
instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of B&W Opco on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be
the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of B&W
Opco. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations of B&W Opco under this
Agreement shall not be terminated as a result of any such assumption.

         (b) B&W Opco shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries
to, directly or indirectly, consummate any Asset Disposition unless B&W Opco or
such Subsidiary receives consideration at the time of such Asset Disposition
that has a fair market value at least equal to the fair market value (including
as to the value of all non-cash consideration) of the shares and assets subject
to such Asset Disposition. In the event that the value of the shares and assets
subject to such Asset Disposition exceeds $20,000,000, the fair market value of
such shares and assets shall be determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of Reynolds American.

         (c) B&W Opco shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries,
directly or indirectly, to make a Restricted Payment if at the time B&W Opco or
such Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment the Consolidated Net Worth
(adjusted to give effect to any such Restricted Payment) would be less than
$[     ](3).


----------
         (3) To be equal to 75% of the Consolidated Net Worth of B&W Opco and
its Subsidiaries, after giving effect to the Transactions (including the merger
of RJR-T into B&W Opco and the SF Distribution), subject to reduction in the
event the Reynolds American Loan is repaid.
<PAGE>
         (d) The limitations set forth in this Section 5.05 shall terminate in
the event that Reynolds American has expressly assumed all of the obligations of
B&W Opco under this Agreement. Any such assumption shall be in writing and in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to B&W. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the obligations of B&W Opco under this Agreement (other than under
this Section 5.05) shall not be terminated as a result of any such assumption.

         SECTION 6.02. Amendments; Waivers. (a) No provision of this Agreement
may be amended or waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the parties hereto, or in the case of a
waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective.

         (b) The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its
rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this Agreement
of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or further exercise
of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies
provided by law or otherwise.

         SECTION 6.03. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section, Subsection, Schedule or Exhibit, such reference shall be
to a Section or Subsection of, or a Schedule or an Exhibit to, this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein", "hereby" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer
to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall refer to the date of this Agreement.
The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
shall mean the
<PAGE>
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean
simply "if". The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement or instrument
defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred
to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to time amended,
modified or supplemented. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns. This Agreement, including the provisions of Article V,
shall not be strictly construed against any Indemnitee seeking to enforce any
indemnification rights under this Agreement.

         SECTION 6.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law,
or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that the Transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

         SECTION 6.05. Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have
been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties; provided,
however, that the rights and obligations of Reynolds American under this
Agreement shall not become effective until the completion of the B&W Opco Stock
Contribution. This Agreement and the obligations set forth herein shall remain
in effect following consummation of the Transactions and shall not terminate
unless and until each of the parties hereto has agreed to such termination in
writing.

         SECTION 6.06. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This
Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement,
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter
<PAGE>
hereof and thereof and, except for Article V, are not intended to confer upon
any Person other than the parties any rights or remedies.

         SECTION 6.07. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of
laws thereof.

         SECTION 6.08. Assignment. Except as set forth in Section 5.05(a),
neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto, except that B&W may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or
all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to [PLC] or any
of its Subsidiaries that agrees in writing to be bound by the provisions hereof
(provided that any such assignment shall not relieve B&W from its obligations
under this Agreement). Any purported assignment without such prior written
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and assigns.

         SECTION 6.09. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court located in the
State of Delaware or in the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself to the
personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the State of Delaware or
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny
or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from
any such court, (c) irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and agrees not to
plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any action, suit or
proceeding
<PAGE>
arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (d) agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any Transaction in any court
other than any Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware or Chancery Court
of the State of Delaware (provided that this Section 6.09(d) shall not apply in
respect of any claim for indemnification in respect of any Third Party Claim
that is brought in any other court, in which case, such an action may be brought
in such other court) and (e) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to
any action related to or arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction.

         SECTION 6.10. Confidentiality. (a) B&W agrees to maintain, and B&W
shall cause its directors, officers, employees and other representatives to
maintain, the confidentiality of all material non-public information obtained by
B&W from Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
directors, officers, employees or agents in connection with this Agreement.

         (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the confidentiality obligations of
Section 6.10(a) will not apply to information obtained other than in violation
of this Agreement:

                  (i) which B&W or any of its directors, officers, employees or
         other representatives is required to disclose by judicial or
         administrative process, or by other requirements of applicable law or
         regulation or any governmental authority; provided, however, that,
         where and to the extent practicable, B&W (A) will give B&W Opco and
         Reynolds American reasonable notice of any such requirement and, to the
         extent protective measures consistent with such requirement are
         available, the opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures and
         (B) will cooperate with B&W Opco and Reynolds American in attempting to
         obtain such protective measures;

                  (ii) which becomes available to the public other than as a
         result of a breach of Section 6.10(a); or

                  (iii) which has been provided to B&W or any of its officers,
         employees or other representatives by a third party other than from
         Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
         directors, officers, employees or agents whom B&W reasonably
<PAGE>
         believes obtained such information in breach of a contractual or
         fiduciary obligation to B&W Opco.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any party to this
Agreement (and any employee, representative or other agent of such party) may
disclose to any and all Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax
treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax analyses) that
are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax structure, except that
(i) this provision shall not permit disclosure until the earliest of (A) the
date of the public announcement of discussions relating to the transaction, (B)
the date of the public announcement of the transaction or (C) the date of the
execution of an agreement (with or without conditions) to enter into the
transaction, (ii) tax treatment and tax structure shall not include the identity
of any existing or future party (or any affiliate of such party) to this
Agreement and (iii) this provision shall not permit disclosure to the extent
that nondisclosure is necessary in order to comply with applicable securities

                  (g) Without limiting the generality of Section 2.01(c), in the
event that the number of Investor Directors on the Board of Directors differs
from the number that B&W has the right (and wishes) to designate pursuant to
this Section 2.01, (i) if the number of Investor Directors exceeds such number,
B&W shall promptly take all appropriate action to cause to resign that number of
Investor Directors as is required to make the remaining number of such Investor
Directors conform to this Section 2.01 or (ii) if the number of Investor
Directors otherwise is less than such number, the Board of Directors shall take
all necessary action to create sufficient vacancies on the Board of Directors to
permit B&W to designate the full number of Investor Directors that it is
entitled (and wishes) to designate pursuant to this Section 2.01 (such action to
include expanding the size of the Board of Directors, seeking the resignation of
Directors or, at the request of B&W, calling a special


                                       11
<PAGE>


meeting of the shareholders of Reynolds American for the purpose of removing
Directors to create such vacancies to the extent permitted by applicable law).
Upon the creation of any vacancy pursuant to the preceding sentence, B&W shall
designate the person to fill such vacancy in accordance with this Section 2.01,
and the Board of Directors shall elect each person so designated. In the event
that the number of Directors is increased pursuant to this Section 2.01(g), the
Board of Directors shall cause the number of Directors to be reduced at the
first available opportunity to comply with the number of Directors otherwise
specified by Section 2.01(a).

                  (h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing,
in no event will (i) the number of Investor Directors divided by the total
number of Directors then comprising the Board exceed (ii) the number of Investor
Directors which B&W is then entitled to designate pursuant to Sections 2.01(c)
and (d) divided by 12, rounded up to the nearest whole number.

                  (i) In the event that the Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee or the Board of Directors relies on Section 2.08 to exclude an
Investor Director nominee from management's slate of nominees (or otherwise take
adverse action with respect to any such Investor Director nominee, including
failing to recommend the election of such Investor Director nominee), the
Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee and the Board of Directors shall
afford B&W a reasonable opportunity to select a replacement Investor Director
nominee for inclusion, subject to Section 2.08, on management's slate of
nominees.

                  SECTION 2.02. Solicitation and Voting of Shares. (a) Reynolds
American shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from its shareholders
eligible to vote for the election of Directors proxies in favor of the nominees
selected in accordance with Section 2.01.

                  (b) In any election of Directors or any meeting of the
shareholders of Reynolds American called expressly for the removal of Directors,
so long as the Board of Directors will include after such meeting (assuming for
this calculation that management's entire slate of nominees is elected at such
meeting) the number of Investor


                                       12
<PAGE>


Directors contemplated by Section 2.01, each Investor Party shall attend in
person or by proxy for purposes of establishing a quorum and shall vote all
their shares of Voting Stock (i) in favor of any nominee or Director selected in
accordance with Section 2.01 and(ii) otherwise against the removal of any
Director designated in accordance with Section 2.01; provided, however, that the
Investor Parties will have no obligation under this sentence with respect to the
election of Directors at a meeting of Reynolds American shareholders where a
Person (other than Reynolds American, an Investor Party, a Person that is part
of a 13D Group with any Investor Party or any Person on the behalf of any of
them) has made a material effort to solicit proxies in favor of a different
slate of nominees for election to the Board at such meeting. In any other matter
submitted to a vote of the shareholders of Reynolds American, the Investor
Parties may vote any or all of their shares in their sole discretion; provided,
however, that in the event B&W shall have the right to approve a matter pursuant
to Section 2.04(b) or 2.04(c) and B&W has elected not to exercise such approval
right, the Investor Parties shall vote to approve such matter at any meeting of
shareholders held in connection therewith.

                  (c) Each Investor Party hereby appoints Reynolds American and
any designee of Reynolds American, each of them individually, its proxy and
attorney-in-fact, with full power of substitution and resubstitution (i) to vote
or act by written consent with respect to all of B&W's Voting Stock which it has
the right to vote pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.02(b) or the
proviso to the second sentence of Section 2.02(b) and (ii) to sign its name (as
shareholder) to any consent, certificate or other document relating to Reynolds
American that the law of the State of North Carolina may permit or require in
connection with any matter referred to in clause (i). This proxy is given to
secure the performance of the duties of each Investor Party under this
Agreement, and its existence will not be deemed to relieve any Investor Party of
its obligations under Section 2.02(b). Each Investor Party affirms that this
proxy is coupled with an interest and is irrevocable until termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.11, whereupon such proxy and power of attorney
shall automatically terminate. Each Investor Party shall take such further
action and execute such other instruments


                                       13
<PAGE>


as may be necessary to effectuate the intent of this proxy. For Voting Stock as
to which any Investor Party is the beneficial but not the record owner, each
Investor Party will cause any record owner of such Voting Stock to grant
Reynolds American a proxy to the same effect as that contained herein. Each
Investor Party represents that any proxy heretofore given in respect of such
Voting Stock is not irrevocable, and hereby revokes any and all such proxies.
This Section 2.02(c) shall not limit any Investor Party's right to vote pursuant
to the second sentence of Section 2.02(b) (other than pursuant to the proviso
thereof) and shall not operate to grant any proxy to any Person in connection
therewith.

                  (d) B&W agrees that it will take all action as a shareholder
of Reynolds American, or as is otherwise reasonably within its control, as
necessary to effect the provisions of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.03. Committees. (a) Subject to the general oversight
and authority of the Board of Directors under applicable law, the Board of
Directors shall establish, empower and maintain the committees of the Board of
Directors contemplated by this Section 2.03.

                  (b) The following committees shall be established, empowered
and maintained by the Board of Directors at all times during the term of this
Agreement: (i) an Audit Committee, (ii) a Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee and (iii) a Compensation Committee (collectively, the "Core
Committees"). Each of the Audit Committee, the Nomination and Governance
Committee and the Compensation Committee shall consist solely of Independent
Directors. Investor Directors shall serve on each committee of the Board of
Directors, and the number of Investor Directors on a committee of the Board of
Directors shall be not less than (x) the number of Investor Directors at such
time divided by (y) the total number of Directors at such time multiplied by (z)
the number of Directors serving on such committee, rounded to the nearest whole
number, with B&W selecting the Investor Directors that will serve on each
committee of the Board, subject to the requirements set forth herein; provided,
however, that (i) each of the committees named in this Section 2.03(b) shall
have not less than five Directors on such committee


                                       14
<PAGE>


and (ii) so long as there are any Investor Directors serving on the Board of
Directors, at least one Investor Director shall serve on each committee of the
Board of Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Investor Director shall
not serve on any committee if such service would violate mandatory legal or
listing requirements (or law, rule or regulation requiring committee member
independence as a condition to a material benefit to Reynolds American or any of
its Subsidiaries) concerning the independence of directors; provided, however,
that Reynolds American shall take all reasonable efforts to avoid any such
disqualification.

                  (c) The Board of Directors may establish such other committees
as it deems necessary or desirable, provided that such committees are
established in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (including the
proportionality requirement set forth in Section 2.03(b)).

                  (d) The Board of Directors shall designate an Investor
Director or an Other Director to replace any disqualified Investor Director
member or Other Director member, respectively, of any committee. In the event
that any Investor Director or Other Director ceases to serve on any committee of
the Board of Directors and, after a reasonable time, no successor to such
Director is designated in accordance with the terms hereof to serve on such
committee, the number of members of such committee may be temporarily reduced if
such reduction does not (and no such reduction is intended to) result in a
change of the relative authorities and representation within such committee
among the Investor Directors (taken as a group) and the Other Directors (taken
as a group).

                  (e) In the event that the Board of Directors or any committee
thereof relies on Section 2.08 to exclude an Investor Director from serving on a
committee on which such Investor Director is qualified to serve, the Board of
Directors and any such committee shall permit B&W to designate another Investor
Director, subject to Section 2.08, to serve as a member of such committee.

                  SECTION 2.04. Approval Required for Certain Actions. (a) The
approval of a majority of the Investor Directors shall be required for the Board
of Directors to


                                       15
<PAGE>


approve or authorize, and for Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries to
do, any of the following (in addition to any other Board or shareholder approval
required by any law, rule or regulation or the constituent documents of Reynolds
American):

                  (i) if, at the time of such approval, authorization or action,
         B&W's Percentage Interest has not fallen below 32%, issue any Equity
         Securities, or any securities convertible into or exercisable for
         Equity Securities, in any transaction or series of related transactions
         if such issuance would require the approval of Reynolds American's
         shareholders under NYSE Rule 312.03(c) as in effect of the date of this
         Agreement (assuming the "20 percent" threshold set forth therein were,
         instead, "5 percent" and disregarding the exceptions set forth
         therein); or

                  (ii) if, at the time of such approval, authorization or
         action, B&W's Percentage Interest has not fallen below 25%, repurchase
         Common Stock pursuant to self-tender offers, stock repurchase programs,
         open market transactions or otherwise; provided, however, that Reynolds
         American and its Subsidiaries may (x) repurchase Common Stock from
         employees or former employees pursuant to the terms and conditions of
         Reynolds American's employee stock plans, (y) on or after the first
         anniversary of the Closing, repurchase Common Stock if the dividends
         declared (and, to the extent the payment date has occurred, paid) on
         Common Stock during each of the preceding four fiscal quarters has
         equaled or exceeded 18.75% of the Prior Year Net Income applicable at
         the time that any such dividend was declared and (z) repurchase Common
         Stock to comply with the requirements of Section 2.04(d).

                  (b) The approval of B&W, as shareholder, such approval, if
given, not to be unreasonably delayed, shall be required for Reynolds American
or any of its Subsidiaries to do or effect any of the following (in addition to
any other Board or shareholder approval required by any law, rule, regulation or
the constituent documents of Reynolds American):


                                       16
<PAGE>


                  (i) the entry by Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries
         into any Discriminatory Transaction;

                  (ii) any sale, asset exchange, lease, exchange, mortgage,
         pledge, transfer or other disposition (by merger or otherwise)
         (collectively, a "disposition") by Reynolds American or any of its
         Subsidiaries (in one transaction or a series of transactions) of any of
         Reynolds American's intellectual property relating to the brands set
         forth on Schedule 2.04, other than any disposition to a wholly-owned
         Subsidiary of Reynolds American or any disposition that (A) occurs in
         connection with creating or granting any liens to a third party that is
         not an affiliate of Reynolds American in connection with a bona fide
         financing, (B) arises as a matter of law or occurs pursuant to a court
         order, (C) occurs as a result of the acquisition of all outstanding
         Equity Securities by any Person (including by way of merger, tender or
         exchange offer or any similar transaction) or all or virtually all of
         the assets of Reynolds American and its Subsidiaries or (D) if B&W's
         Percentage Interest has fallen below 32%, occurs as a result of the
         acquisition of a majority of the Voting Power of all outstanding Voting
         Stock by any Person (including by way of merger, tender or exchange
         offer or similar transaction);

                  (iii) any amendment to the Articles of Incorporation or
         By-Laws of Reynolds American or to the charter of any committee of the
         Board of Directors, in each case which amendment would conflict in any
         material respect with the provisions of this Agreement, or any
         amendment or repeal of Section 2.03 or Section 2.04 of the By-Laws of
         Reynolds American in effect as of the Closing; or

                  (iv) the adoption or implementation of any takeover defense
         measures (including a rights plan) that would apply to the acquisition
         of beneficial ownership of any Equity Securities by any Investor Party;
         provided, however, that Reynolds American may enter into a Rights
         Agreement in the form of Exhibit C to the Combination Agreement and may
         enter into any replacement or extension thereof in the form of such
         Exhibit C.


                                       17
<PAGE>


                  (c) The approval of B&W, as shareholder, such approval, if
given, not to be unreasonably delayed, shall be required for Reynolds American
or any of its Subsidiaries to do or effect any of the following prior to the
fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement(in addition to any other Board
or shareholder approval required by any law, rule, regulation or the constituent
documents of Reynolds American):

                  (i) effect any transaction or take any action that is
         reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the representations, facts or
         assumptions set forth in the B&W Tax Ruling (as defined in the
         Combination Agreement) or materially inconsistent with the
         representations, facts or assumptions set forth in the materials
         submitted to the Internal Revenue Service in seeking the B&W Tax
         Ruling; provided, however, that for purposes of this Section
         2.04(c)(i), if a representation, fact or assumption set forth in the
         B&W Tax Ruling or the materials submitted to the Internal Revenue
         Service in seeking the B&W Tax Ruling indicated that a party had no
         plan or intention to effect a particular transaction or take a
         particular action, effecting such transaction or taking such action
         after the Closing (as defined in the Combination Agreement) will be
         deemed to be inconsistent with such plan or intention representation,
         fact or assumption; or

                  (ii) effect any other transaction or take any other action
         that, in the opinion of Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP or other nationally
         recognized B&W tax counsel, had such transaction or action been
         effected at Closing, would more likely than not have prevented the
         Asset Contribution and Assumption of Liabilities, on the one hand, or
         the B&W Opco Stock Contribution and the Merger (as those terms are
         defined in the Combination Agreement), on the other hand, from
         qualifying as exchanges within the meaning of Section 351 of the
         Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

In addition, B&W and Reynolds American shall cooperate in good faith, and shall
cause their respective officers, directors, affiliates, employees, agents,
auditors and representatives to cooperate in good faith, in all matters


                                       18
<PAGE>


relating to Taxes (as defined in the Combination Agreement), including by
maintaining and making available to each other all books and records necessary
in connection with Taxes.

                  (d) If, on or prior to June 30, 2005, Reynolds American issues
Common Stock upon exercise of any option, warrant or other security relating to
Common Stock or otherwise issues Common Stock (restricted or otherwise) to any
of its directors, officers, employees or consultants, then prior to or within a
reasonable period after such issuance (but in any event not later than the end
of such fiscal quarter in which such issuance occurs), Reynolds American will
repurchase a number of shares of outstanding Common Stock so that the number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock are not increased by such issuance; provided,
however, that (i) Reynolds American will not be required to repurchase such
shares, if, at the time of such issuance, B&W's Percentage Interest has fallen
below 25% and (ii) Reynolds American will not be required to repurchase the
first [          ](1) shares that are so issued.

                  SECTION 2.05. Financial Statements. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the end of each fiscal quarter and fiscal year, Reynolds
American shall furnish to B&W and BAT the consolidated financial statements of
Reynolds American (including providing draft statements as such statements
become available and, with respect to fiscal years, audit reports as such
reports become available). Each of Reynolds American, B&W and BAT shall use its
reasonable best efforts to assist the other party with respect to the timeliness
of filing, releasing or posting the other party's respective financial
disclosure documents. Reynolds American shall cooperate with and assist BAT and
B&W in the translation of Reynolds American's financial statements in order to
conform such financial statements to applicable international accounting
standards and shall otherwise provide BAT and B&W with access to information
necessary in connection with such financial statements.

----------

        (1) Number to be equal to the number of Common Shares owned by B&W
immediately after Closing minus 42% of the aggregate outstanding Common Shares
immediately after Closing.

<PAGE>


                  SECTION 2.06. Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws. The Board
of Directors of Reynolds American shall take or cause to be taken all lawful
action necessary to ensure at all times that Reynolds American's Articles of
Incorporation and By-Laws are not at any time inconsistent in any material
respect with the provisions of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.07. Interested Transactions. The approval by a
majority of the Other Directors shall be required (in addition to any other
Board or shareholder approval required by any law, rule or regulation) for
Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into or effect, or agree
to enter into or effect, any material contract or transaction between or
involving Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any
Investor Party, on the other hand, the terms of which are not governed by a
pre-existing agreement to which Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party or a provision of Reynolds American's Articles of Incorporation or
By-Laws.

                  SECTION 2.08. Fiduciary Duties. Nothing in Section 2.01, 2.02,
2.03 or 2.06 shall be deemed to require the Board of Directors or any committee
or member thereof to take any action or refrain from taking any action, or
result in a breach of Sections 2.01, 2.02, 2.03 or 2.06 by reason of such action
or failure to act, if the Board of Directors, such committee or Director
determines in good faith (after consideration of specific written advice of
outside legal counsel, which advice will be provided to B&W) that refraining
from taking such action or failing to take such action, as the case may be,
would cause a violation of his or her fiduciary duties to shareholders,
including B&W and its affiliates, under applicable law. This Section 2.08 shall
not be interpreted to create any fiduciary obligation that would not exist in
the absence of this Section 2.08.

                  SECTION 2.09. Change in Law. In the event any law, rule or
regulation comes into force or effect (including by amendment) which conflicts
with the terms and


                                       20
<PAGE>


conditions of this Agreement, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
revise the Agreement to achieve the parties' intention set forth herein.

                  SECTION 2.10. Changes in B&W's Percentage Interest
Attributable to Issuances of Common Stock. To the extent that any decrease in
B&W's Percentage Interest is attributable to issuances of Equity Securities by
Reynolds American (as opposed to dispositions of Equity Securities by any
Investor Party), such decrease will not be taken into account in determining
whether B&W's Percentage Interest has fallen below any of the thresholds for
B&W's Percentage Interest set forth in this Article II.

                                   ARTICLE III

                               Registration Rights

                  SECTION 3.01. Registration. (a) At any time and from time to
time following the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement, Reynolds
American agrees that upon the written request of any Investor Party holding
Registrable Securities (a "Demand Registration"), it will as promptly as
reasonably practical prepare and file a registration statement (a "Registration
Statement") under the Securities Act as to the number of shares of Registrable
Securities specified in such request; provided, however, that (i) Reynolds
American shall not be obligated to effect more than two Demand Registrations in
any eighteen-month period, (ii) the Registrable Securities for which a Demand
Registration has been requested by any Investor Party holding Registrable
Securities shall have a value (based on the average closing price per share of
Common Stock for the ten trading days preceding the delivery of B&W's request
for such Demand Registration) of not less than $100,000,000 and (iii) Reynolds
American shall not be required to file a shelf Registration Statement pursuant
to Rule 415 of the Securities Act under this Section 3.01. Each such request for
a Demand Registration shall specify the number of shares of Registrable
Securities proposed to be offered for sale and shall also specify the intended
method of distribution thereof; provided, however, that the Investor Parties may
change such number if such change shall not materially adversely affect the
timing or success of the offering, so


                                       21
<PAGE>


long as such change does not result in less than $100,000,000 of Registrable
Securities being included in the Registration Statement.

                  (b) Reynolds American agrees to use its reasonable best
efforts (i) to cause any Registration Statement to be declared effective as
promptly as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof and (ii) to keep
such Registration Statement effective for a period of not less than 90 days, or,
if earlier, the period sufficient to complete the distribution of the
Registrable Securities. Reynolds American further agrees to supplement or make
amendments to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement effective for the period set forth in clause (ii) above,
including (A) to respond to the comments of the SEC, if any, (B) as may be
required by the registration form utilized by Reynolds American for such
Registration Statement or by the instructions applicable to such registration
form, (C) as may be required by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder or (D) as may be reasonably requested in writing by B&W or any
Underwriter for B&W. Reynolds American agrees to furnish to B&W copies of any
such supplement or amendment prior to its being used or filed with the SEC. Upon
the expiration of the time period set forth in clause (ii) above, a Demand
Registration Statement shall count as a Demand Registration Statement for
purposes of determining when future Demand Registrations which can be requested
pursuant to this Section 3.01, except to the extent set forth in paragraph (e)
below.

                  (c) In the event an offering of shares of Registrable
Securities involves one or more Underwriters, B&W shall select the lead
Underwriter and any additional Underwriters in connection with the offering from
a list of nationally-recognized investment banks reasonably agreed to between
Reynolds American and B&W.

                  (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.01, B&W may not request a Demand Registration within the 90-day period after a
Registration Statement for Common Stock has been filed by Reynolds American (for
its own account or for any other security holders) with and declared effective
by the SEC, unless


                                       22
<PAGE>


such Registration Statement has been withdrawn; provided, however, the forgoing
limitation will not apply if an Investor Party holding Registrable Securities
was not given the opportunity, in accordance with Section 3.02, to include its
Registrable Securities in the Registration Statement described in this Section
3.01(d).

                  (e) Any Investor Party holding Registrable Securities included
in a Registration Statement shall be permitted to remove all or any part of the
Registrable Securities held by it from any Registration Statement at any time
prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement covering such
Registrable Securities; provided, however, that such Demand Registration shall
nonetheless count as a Demand Registration for purposes of determining when
future Demand Registrations can be requested pursuant to this Section 3.01,
unless B&W reimburses Reynolds American for all Registration Expenses incurred
by Reynolds American in connection with such withdrawn Demand Registration.

                  SECTION 3.02. Piggyback Registration. If Reynolds American
proposes to file a Registration Statement under the Securities Act with respect
to an offering of Common Stock for (a) Reynolds American's own account (other
than a Registration Statement on Form S-4 or S-8 (or any substitute form that
may be adopted by the SEC)) or (b) the account of any of its holders of Common
Stock pursuant to a demand registration requested by such holders, then Reynolds
American shall give written notice of such proposed filing to B&W as soon as
practicable (but in no event less than twenty days before the anticipated filing
date), and such notice shall offer any Investor Party holding Registrable
Securities the opportunity to register such number of shares of Registrable
Securities as B&W and its affiliates may request on the same terms and
conditions as Reynolds American's or such holder's Common Stock (a "Piggyback
Registration"). Reynolds American shall control the determination of the form of
any offering contemplated by this Section 3.02, including whether any such
offering shall be in the form of an underwritten offering and, if any such
offering is in the form of an underwritten offering, Reynolds American shall
select the lead Underwriter and any additional Underwriters in connection with
such offering.

                  SECTION 3.03. Reduction of Offering. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein, if the lead Underwriter of an underwritten offering described
in Section 3.01 or Section 3.02 delivers a written opinion to Reynolds American
that the number of shares of Common Stock (including all Registrable Securities)
that B&W, Reynolds American and any other Persons intend to include in any
Registration Statement is such that the success of any such offering would be
materially and adversely affected, including the price at which the securities
can be sold, then the number of shares of Common Stock to be included in the
Registration Statement for the account of B&W, Reynolds American and any other
Persons shall be reduced pro rata to the extent necessary to reduce the total
amount of securities to be included in any such Registration Statement to the
amount recommended by such lead Underwriter; provided, however, that (a)
priority in the case of a Demand Registration pursuant to Section 3.01 shall be
(i) first, the Registrable Securities requested to be included in the
Registration Statement for the account of the Investor Parties, allocated pro
rata among them in accordance with the number of Registrable Securities held by
each of them so that the total number of Registrable Securities to be included
in any such offering for the account of all such Persons will not exceed the
number recommended by such lead Underwriter, (ii) second, securities initially
proposed to be offered by Reynolds American for its own account and (iii) third,
pro rata among any other securities of Reynolds American requested to be
registered by the holders thereof pursuant to a contractual right of
registration so that the total number of registrable securities to be included
in any such offering for the account of all such Persons will not exceed the
number recommended by such lead Underwriter, (b) priority in the case of a
Piggyback Registration initiated by Reynolds American for its own account
pursuant to Section 3.02 shall be (i) first, securities initially proposed to be
offered by Reynolds American for its own account, (ii) second, the Registrable
Securities requested to be included in the Registration Statement for the
account of the Investor Parties, allocated pro rata among them in accordance
with the number of registrable securities held by each of them so that the total
number of Registrable Securities to be included in any such offering for the
account of all such Persons will not exceed the


                                       24
<PAGE>


number recommended by such lead Underwriter, and (iii) third, pro rata among any
other securities of Reynolds American requested to be registered pursuant to a
contractual right of registration and (c) priority with respect to inclusion of
securities in a Registration Statement initiated by Reynolds American for the
account of holders other than any Investor Party pursuant to demand registration
rights afforded such holders shall be (i) first, securities offered for the
account of such holders so that the total number of registrable securities to be
included in any such offering for the account of all such Persons will not
exceed the number recommended by such lead Underwriter, (ii) second, securities
offered by Reynolds American for its own account, (iii) third, the Registrable
Securities offered for the account of the Investor Parties and (iv) fourth, pro
rata among any other securities of Reynolds American requested to be registered
pursuant to a contractual right of registration. Until such time as B&W owns
less than 15% of the outstanding Common Stock of Reynolds American, Reynolds
American shall not enter into any contractual arrangements that would conflict
with the priorities set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence.

                  SECTION 3.04. Registration Procedures. Subject to the
provisions of Section 3.01 hereof, in connection with the registration of the
sale of Registrable Securities hereunder, Reynolds American will as promptly as
reasonably practicable:

                  (a) furnish to B&W, if requested, prior to the filing of a
         Registration Statement, copies of such Registration Statement as is
         proposed to be filed, and thereafter such number of copies of such
         Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto (in each
         case including all exhibits thereto and documents incorporated by
         reference therein), the prospectus included in such Registration
         Statement (including each preliminary prospectus), copies of any and
         all transmittal letters or other correspondence with the SEC relating
         to the Registration Statement and such other documents in such
         quantities as B&W may reasonably request from time to time in order to
         facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities;


                                       25
<PAGE>


                  (b) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
         Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of
         such jurisdictions as B&W reasonably requests and do any and all other
         acts and things as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable
         B&W to consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such
         jurisdictions; provided, however, that Reynolds American will not be
         required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction
         where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
         Section 3.04(b), (ii) subject itself to taxation in any such
         jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general service of process in any such
         jurisdiction;

                  (c) notify B&W, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto
         is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening
         of any event as a result of which the prospectus included in such
         Registration Statement or amendment contains an untrue statement of a
         material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
         therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
         the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and
         Reynolds American will prepare a supplement or amendment to such
         prospectus so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the
         Registrable Securities, such prospectus will not contain an untrue
         statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
         required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
         therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
         not misleading;

                  (d) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable
         Securities covered by any Registration Statement to be registered with
         or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may
         be necessary by virtue of the business and operations of Reynolds
         American to enable B&W to consummate the disposition of the Registrable
         Securities; provided, however, that Reynolds American will not be
         required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction
         where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
         Section 3.04(d), (ii) subject


                                       26
<PAGE>


         itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or (iii) consent to general
         service of process in any such jurisdiction;

                  (e) enter into customary agreements (including an underwriting
         agreement in customary form that is reasonably satisfactory to Reynolds
         American) and use commercially reasonable efforts to take such other
         actions as are reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate
         the disposition of the Registrable Securities;

                  (f) make available for inspection by B&W, any Underwriter
         participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration
         Statement, and any attorney for B&W and the Underwriter and any
         accountant or other agent retained by B&W or any such Underwriter
         (collectively, the "Inspectors"), all financial and other records,
         pertinent corporate documents and properties of Reynolds American
         (collectively, the "Records") as shall be reasonably necessary to
         enable them to exercise their due diligence responsibility, and cause
         the officers, directors and employees of Reynolds American and its
         Subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
         Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement; provided,
         however, that (i) Records and information obtained hereunder shall be
         used by such Inspector only to exercise their due diligence
         responsibility, (ii) Records or information that Reynolds American
         determines, in good faith, to be confidential shall not be disclosed by
         the Inspectors unless (x) the disclosure of such Records or information
         is necessary to avoid or correct a material misstatement or omission in
         the Registration Statement or (y) the release of such Records or
         information is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order from a
         court or governmental authority of competent jurisdiction and (iii)
         Reynolds American may require, as a condition to the provision to any
         Inspector of any Records, that such Inspector execute and deliver to
         Reynolds American a written agreement, in form and substance reasonably
         satisfactory to Reynolds American, pursuant to which such Inspector
         agrees to the confidential treatment of such Records;


                                       27
<PAGE>


                  (g) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to
         the Underwriters and the Investor Parties a comfort letter from the
         independent public accountants for Reynolds American in customary form
         and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by comfort
         letters as such Underwriters and the Investor Parties may reasonably
         request;

                  (h) use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to
         the Underwriters and the Investor Parties a 10b-5 statement and legal
         opinions from Reynolds American's counsel in customary form and
         covering such matters as customarily covered by 10b-5 statements and
         legal opinions as such Underwriters and the Investor Parties may
         reasonably request;

                  (i) otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to comply with
         all applicable rules and regulations of the SEC, and make generally
         available to its security holders, within the required time period, an
         earnings statement covering a period of twelve months, beginning with
         the first fiscal quarter after the effective date of the Registration
         Statement (as the term "effective date" is defined in Rule 158(c) under
         the Securities Act), which earnings statement shall satisfy the
         provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158
         thereunder or any successor provisions thereto; and

                  (j) use its reasonable best efforts to cause all Registrable
         Securities to be listed or quoted on the NYSE and each other securities
         exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities
         issued by Reynolds American are listed or quoted.

                  SECTION 3.05. Conditions to Offerings. The obligations of
Reynolds American to take the actions contemplated by Sections 3.01, 3.02 and
3.04 with respect to an offering of Registrable Securities shall be subject to
the following conditions:

                  (a) the Investor Parties shall conform to all applicable
         requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act with respect to
         the offering and sale of securities;


                                       28
<PAGE>


                  (b) B&W shall advise each Underwriter through which any of the
         Registrable Securities are offered that the Registrable Securities are
         part of a distribution that is subject to the prospectus delivery
         requirements of the Securities Act;

                  (c) Reynolds American may require B&W to furnish to Reynolds
         American such information regarding B&W or the distribution of the
         Registrable Securities as Reynolds American may from time to time
         reasonably request in writing, in each case only as required by the
         Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder or under state
         securities or blue sky laws; and

                  (d) in any underwritten offering pursuant to Section 3.01 or
         Section 3.02 hereof, any Investor Party including Registrable
         Securities in a Registration Statement, together with Reynolds
         American, shall enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form
         with the Underwriter or Underwriters selected for such underwriting, as
         well as such other documents customary in similar offerings, including,
         custody agreements, powers of attorney and indemnification provisions
         relating to information provided in writing by an Investor Party.

Any Investor Party holding Registrable Securities agrees that, upon receipt of
any notice from Reynolds American of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 3.04(c) hereof or a condition described in Section 3.06
hereof, B&W will forthwith discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities
pursuant to the Registration Statement covering the sale of such shares of
Registrable Securities until B&W's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or
amended prospectus contemplated by Section 3.04(c) hereof or notice from
Reynolds American of the termination of the Deferral Period and, if so directed
by Reynolds American, will promptly deliver to Reynolds American all copies
(other than any permanent file copies then in B&W's possession) of the most
recent prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that was current at the
time of receipt of such notice.


                                       29
<PAGE>


                  SECTION 3.06. Black-out Period. Reynolds American's
obligations pursuant to Sections 3.01 and 3.02 hereof shall be suspended if
compliance with such obligations would (a) violate applicable law or (b) require
Reynolds American to disclose a material financing, acquisition or other
corporate development, and the proper officers of Reynolds American have
determined, in the good faith exercise of their reasonable business judgment,
that such disclosure is not in the best interests of Reynolds American;
provided, however, that any such suspension shall not exceed 60 days and all
such suspensions shall not exceed 120 days in any twelve-month period (the
"Deferral Period"). Reynolds American shall promptly give B&W written notice of
any such suspension containing the approximate length of the anticipated delay,
and Reynolds American shall notify B&W upon the termination of the Deferral
Period.

                  SECTION 3.07. Registration Expenses. All fees and expenses
incident to Reynolds American's performance of or compliance with the
registration obligations of this Article III, including all fees and expenses of
compliance with securities or blue sky laws (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel for any Underwriters in connection with blue sky
qualifications of the Registrable Securities), printing expenses, messenger and
delivery expenses of Reynolds American, any registration or filing fees payable
under any Federal or state securities or blue sky laws, the fees and expenses
incurred in connection with any listing or quoting of the securities to be
registered on any national securities exchange or automated quotation system,
fees and disbursements of counsel for Reynolds American and its independent
certified public accountants (including the expenses of any comfort letters
required by or incident to such performance) and the fees and expenses of other
Persons retained by Reynolds American, will be borne by Reynolds American. Any
Investor Party or any other Person registering Registrable Securities will bear
and pay any underwriting discounts and commissions applicable to securities
offered for its or its affiliates' account, transfer taxes and fees and expenses
of its counsel.

                  SECTION 3.08. Indemnification; Contribution. (a) In connection
with any registration of Registrable


                                       30
<PAGE>


Securities pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.02 hereof, Reynolds American agrees to
indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by law, B&W, its affiliates, their
directors, officers and shareholders and each Person who controls B&W (within
the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) caused by any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus contained therein, or any omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a prospectus, in the
light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided,
however, that Reynolds American shall not be required to indemnify B&W, its
affiliates, their officers, directors, shareholders or controlling Persons for
any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses resulting from any such
untrue statement or omission if such untrue statement or omission is made in
reliance on and in conformity with any information with respect to B&W or such
other parties furnished to Reynolds American in writing by B&W or such other
parties expressly for use therein. In connection with an underwritten offering,
Reynolds American will indemnify each Underwriter, the officers and directors of
such Underwriter, and each Person who controls such Underwriter (within the
meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) to the same extent as
provided above with respect to the indemnification of B&W; provided, however,
that such Underwriter agrees to indemnify Reynolds American to the same extent
as provided below with respect to the indemnification of Reynolds American by
B&W. Notwithstanding the forgoing, with respect to any untrue statement or
omission of material fact made in any prospectus or preliminary prospectus, the
provisions of this Section 3.08 shall not inure to the benefit of any Investor
Party, any other holder of Registrable Securities or any Underwriter from whom
the Person asserting any such loss, claim, damages, liabilities or expenses
purchased the Registrable Securities to the extent that it shall be established
that (i) any such loss, claim, damages, liabilities or expenses of such Person
arises primarily from the fact that any Investor Party or any Underwriter sold
Registrable Securities to such a


                                       31
<PAGE>


Person, (ii) there was not sent or given a copy of the final prospectus (as
amended or supplemented) at or prior to the written confirmation of such sale
(provided Reynolds American shall have previously furnished a sufficient number
of copies thereof on a timely basis to the Investor Parties, any such holder and
each Underwriter, as the case may be, in accordance herewith) and (iii) the
final prospectus (as amended or supplemented) would have corrected any such
untrue statement or omission of a material fact.

                  (b) In connection with any Registration Statement, the
Investor Parties holding Registrable Securities, as the case may be, will
furnish to Reynolds American in writing such information and affidavits with
respect to the Investor Parties holding Registrable Securities, as the case may
be, as Reynolds American reasonably requests, including, but not limited to,
information relating to the Investor Parties, as the case may be, for use in
connection with any such Registration Statement, prospectus or preliminary
prospectus and agrees to indemnify Reynolds American, its directors, its
officers who sign the Registration Statement and each Person, if any, who
controls Reynolds American (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the
foregoing indemnity from Reynolds American to B&W, but only with respect to
information relating to B&W or such other holders of Registrable Securities, as
the case may be, furnished to Reynolds American in writing by B&W expressly for
use in the Registration Statement, the prospectus, any amendment or supplement
thereto, or any preliminary prospectus.

                  (c) In case any proceeding (including any governmental
investigation) shall be instituted involving any Person in respect of which
indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 3.08(a) or (b), such Person
(hereinafter called the indemnified party) shall promptly notify the Person
against whom such indemnity may be sought (hereinafter called the indemnifying
party) in writing and the indemnifying party, upon request of the indemnified
party, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party to
represent the indemnified party and shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
counsel


                                       32
<PAGE>


related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, any indemnified party shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified party unless (i) the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the
retention of such counsel or (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding
(including any impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party and the indemnified party shall have been advised by counsel
that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate
due to actual or potential differing interests between them. It is understood
that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any proceeding or
related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any
local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified parties, and that all such
reasonable fees and expenses shall be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the
case of the retention of any such separate firm for the indemnified parties,
such firm shall be designated in writing by the indemnified parties. The
indemnifying party shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if
there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason
of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at
any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to
reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as
contemplated by the third sentence of this Section 3.08(c), the indemnifying
party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent if (i) such settlement is entered into more
than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request
and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party
in accordance with such request or reasonably objected in writing, on the basis
of the standards set forth herein, to the propriety of such reimbursement prior
to the date of such settlement. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior
written consent of the indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending
or threatened proceeding in respect of which any


                                       33
<PAGE>


indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been
sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an
unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such proceeding.

                  (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 3.08
from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party hereunder in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to in
this Section 3.08, then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such
indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
expenses in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions that
resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as
any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such
indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to,
among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to
state a material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by,
such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties' relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include,
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 3.08(c), any legal or other fees
or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding.

                  The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.08(d) were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 3.08(d). No Person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.


                                       34
<PAGE>


                  If indemnification is available under this Section 3.08, the
indemnifying party shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent
provided in Sections 3.08(a) and (b) without regard to the relative fault of
said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration provided for in this Section 3.08(d).

                  SECTION 3.09. Rule 144. For so long as Reynolds American is
subject to the requirements of Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Securities Act,
Reynolds American agrees that it will file the reports required to be filed by
it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted by the SEC thereunder and it will take such further action as B&W
reasonably may request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable
the Investor Parties to sell Registrable Securities within the limitation of the
exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 under the Securities Act, as such Rule may
be amended from time to time, or (b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter
adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of B&W, Reynolds American will deliver to
B&W a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements.

                  SECTION 3.10. Lockup. If and to the extent requested by the
managing Underwriters of an underwritten public offering of equity securities of
Reynolds American, Reynolds American and B&W agree not to effect, and to cause
their respective affiliates not to effect, except as part of such registration,
any offer, sale, pledge, transfer or other distribution or disposition or any
agreement with respect to the foregoing, of the issue being registered or of a
similar security of Reynolds American, or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for such securities, including a sale pursuant to
Rule 144, during the seven-day period prior to and during such period that the
lead Underwriter may reasonably request, no greater than 90 days, beginning on
the effective date of such registration.

                  SECTION 3.11. Termination of Registration Rights. The
registration rights contained in this


                                       35
<PAGE>


Article III shall terminate on the date on which all shares of Common Stock
subject to this Agreement cease to be Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding
the forgoing, the registration rights contained in this Article III shall
terminate in any event with respect to any Investor Party or any other holder of
Registrable Securities when any such holder no longer owns any Registrable
Securities. In addition, even if the registration rights contained in this
Article III are no longer in effect, in the event that an Investor Party intends
to dispose of a significant number of Common Shares and such disposition could
reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the trading price of shares
of Common Stock or otherwise have an adverse impact on the market for Common
Stock, Reynolds American and the Investor Parties shall cooperate in connection
with such disposition and shall take commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate
the adverse effects of any such disposition; provided, however, that nothing in
this sentence shall be deemed to restrict an Investor Party in connection with
the sale of any Common Stock (including the size or timing of such disposition).

                                   ARTICLE IV

                           Limitations on Purchases of
                       Equity Securities and Other Actions

                  SECTION 4.01. Purchases of Equity Securities. Except for the
acquisition of shares of Common Stock pursuant to the Combination Agreement and
subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 4.03, during the Standstill
Period, the Investor Parties shall not, directly or indirectly, acquire, agree

         a merger, consolidation,


                                       36

         tender or exchange offer, sale or purchase of assets or securities or
         other business combination or any dissolution, liquidation,
         restructuring, recapitalization or similar transaction in each case
         involving Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries or the
         acquisition of any equity interest in, or a substantial portion of the
         assets of, Reynolds American or any of its Subsidiaries;

                  (b) "solicit", or become a "participant" in any "solicitation"
         of, any "proxy" (as such terms are defined in Regulation 14A under the
         Exchange Act) from any holder of Voting Stock in connection with any
         vote on any matter (whether or not relating to the election or removal
         of Directors), or agree or announce its intention to vote with any
         Person undertaking a "solicitation"; (c) form, join or in any way
         participate in a 13D Group with respect to any Voting Stock (other than
         a 13D Group composed of the Investor Parties);

                  (c) form, join or in any way participate in a 13D Group with
         respect to any Voting Stock (other than a 13D Group composed of the
         Investor Parties);

                  (d) grant any proxies with respect to any Voting Stock to any
         Person (other than as recommended by the Board of Directors) or deposit
         any Voting Stock in a voting trust or enter into any other arrangement
         or agreement with respect to the voting thereof;

                  (e) seek, alone or in concert with other Persons, additional
         representation on the Board of Directors or seek the removal of any
         member of the Board that is not an Investor Director or a change in the
         composition or size of the Board of Directors that is inconsistent with
         this Agreement;

                  (f) enter into any arrangements, understandings or agreements
         (whether written or oral) with, or advise, finance or assist any other
         Persons in connection with any of the foregoing; or

                  (g) request, propose or otherwise seek any amendment or waiver
         of the provisions of Article IV.

                  SECTION 4.03. Standstill Exceptions. Notwithstanding Sections
4.01 and 4.02:


                                       37
<PAGE>


                  (a) during the Standstill Period, the Investor Parties may
         acquire beneficial ownership of additional Equity Securities if, after
         giving effect to any such acquisition, B&W's Percentage Interest would
         not exceed the Standstill Percentage less the percentage of Voting
         Power (calculated as of the date of disposition) associated with any
         Equity Securities disposed of by any Investor Party (other than to
         another Investor Party) following the date of this Agreement;

                  (b) if, during the Standstill Period, Reynolds American
         becomes the subject of a Third Party Offer, Reynolds American shall
         promptly, and in any event within two business days, deliver written
         notice to B&W to such effect, which notice shall to the extent known by
         Reynolds American set forth the percentage of Voting Power or assets
         that the third party is seeking to acquire pursuant to the Third Party
         Offer, and the Investor Parties shall have the right to make a B&W
         Counteroffer to the Board of Directors in response to such Third Party
         Offer. If Reynolds American accepts any such B&W Counteroffer, the
         Investor Parties may acquire Equity Securities in accordance with the
         terms of such B&W Counteroffer. If Reynolds American rejects any such
         B&W Counteroffer and enters into an agreement with a third party (other
         than the Investor Parties) with respect to a Significant Transaction or
         a third party (other than the Investor Parties) initiates a tender
         offer or exchange offer that would constitute a Significant
         Transaction, the Investor Parties may make and consummate a public
         proposal constituting a B&W Counteroffer (including by way of a tender
         offer or exchange offer). Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Investor
         Party's right to make any B&W Counteroffer and to acquire additional
         Equity Securities pursuant to this clause (b) is subject to the
         condition that the Investor Directors recuse themselves from any and
         all consideration by the Board of Directors or any committee thereof of
         a Third Party Offer or a B&W Counteroffer; and

                  (c) during the Standstill Period, the Investor Parties shall
         be permitted to make requests to the Board of Directors to amend or
         waive any of the limitations set forth in Section 4.01 or 4.02, which


                                       38
<PAGE>


         the Other Directors, acting by majority, may accept or reject in their
         sole discretion; provided, however, that (i) any such request shall not
         be publicly disclosed by the Investor Parties and (ii) any such request
         shall be made in a manner that is not reasonably likely to require the
         public disclosure of such request by Reynolds American.

                                    ARTICLE V

                            Transfer of Common Stock

                  SECTION 5.01. Limitation on Transfer of Common Stock. (a)
During the term of this Agreement, any sale, transfer or other disposition of
shares of Common Stock by the Investor Parties shall be subject to the following
limitations:

                  (i) no shares of Common Stock may be sold, transferred or
         otherwise disposed of, directly or indirectly, to any Person or 13D
         Group, if, after giving effect to such sale, transfer or other
         disposition such Person or 13D Group would, to B&W's knowledge,
         beneficially own, or have the right to acquire, 7.5% or more of the
         Voting Power of all Voting Stock, except in connection with a tender
         offer or exchange offer for Common Stock (provided that the Board of
         Directors has not recommended to its shareholders that such tender
         offer or exchange offer be rejected); and

                  (ii) none of the Investor Parties will, in any six-month
         period, sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly,
         Common Stock representing in the aggregate more than 5% of the Voting
         Power of all Voting Stock without first obtaining the consent of a
         majority of the Other Directors, except in connection with a tender
         offer or exchange offer for Common Stock (provided that the Board of
         Directors has not recommended to its shareholders that such tender
         offer or exchange offer be rejected).

                  (b) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, B&W may at any time
transfer any or all of its shares of Common Stock to any Investor Party, and any
such transferee may


                                       39
<PAGE>


make similar transfers; provided, however, that (x) any such transferee shall
agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and (y) for purposes of
calculating any ownership threshold applicable to B&W and/or its affiliates
under this Agreement, all shares of Common Stock held by B&W and any permitted
transferee under this Section 5.01(b) shall be taken into account.

                  (c) Reynolds American may place appropriate legends on the
certificates representing Common Stock held by the Investor Parties setting
forth the restrictions referred to above and any restrictions appropriate for
compliance with U.S. federal securities laws. Reynolds American will promptly
issue replacement certificates to the Investor Parties, upon request, in order
to permit the Investor Parties to engage in sales, transfers and other
dispositions that are not restricted hereunder or under U.S. federal securities
laws. Purported transfers of shares of Common Stock that are not in compliance
with this Article V shall be void.

                  SECTION 6.02. Amendments; Waivers. (a) No provision of this
Agreement may be amended or waived unless such amendment or waiver is in writing
and signed, in the case of an amendment, by the parties hereto, or in the case
of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective; provided,
however, that no such amendment or waiver by Reynolds American shall be
effective without the approval of a majority of the Other Directors (except for
amendments or waivers that are administrative in nature or that do not
materially adversely affect the rights of the Unaffiliated Equity Holders, which
amendments and waivers shall only require the approval of a majority of the
Directors).

                  (b) The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
such rights nor shall any single or partial exercise by any party to this
Agreement of any of its rights under this Agreement preclude any other or
further exercise of such rights or any other rights under this Agreement. The
rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any
rights or remedies provided by law or otherwise.

                  SECTION 6.03. Interpretation. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to a Section, Subsection or Exhibit, such reference shall be to a
Section or Subsection of, or an Exhibit to, this Agreement unless otherwise
indicated. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and
not to any particular provision of this Agreement. The words "date hereof" shall
refer to the date of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject
or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if". The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. Any agreement


                                       42
<PAGE>


or instrument defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument
that is referred to herein means such agreement or instrument as from time to
time amended, modified or supplemented. References to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 6.04. Severability. If any term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or
Law, or public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or
other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that the Transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

                  SECTION 6.05. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

                  SECTION 6.06. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.
This Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements constitute the entire
agreement, and supercede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and are not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties
any rights or remedies.

                  SECTION 6.07. Governing Law. Except to the extent specifically
required by the North Carolina Business Corporation Act, this Agreement shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of laws thereof. The parties declare that it is their
intention that this Agreement shall be regarded as made under the laws of the


                                       43
<PAGE>


State of Delaware and that the laws of the State of Delaware shall be applied in
interpreting its provisions in all cases where legal interpretation shall be
required, except to the extent the North Carolina Business Corporation Act is
specifically required by such act to govern the interpretation of this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.08. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in
whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties
without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that B&W
may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and
obligations under this Agreement to BAT or any of its Subsidiaries that agrees
in writing to be bound by the provisions hereof. Any purported assignment
without such prior written consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 6.09. Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement
were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any Federal court
located in the State of Delaware or in the Chancery Court of the State of
Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties (a) consents to submit
itself to the personal jurisdiction of any Federal court located in the State of
Delaware or Chancery Court of the State of Delaware in the event any dispute
arises out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (b) agrees that it will not
attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request
for leave from any such court, (c) irrevocably and unconditionally waives (and
agrees not to plead or claim) any objection to the laying of venue of any
action, suit or proceeding arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction, (d)
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any
Transaction in any court other than any Federal court


                                       44
<PAGE>


sitting in the State of Delaware or Chancery Court of the State of Delaware, (e)
waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Transaction and (f) agrees that this
Agreement involves at least $100,000 and has been entered into by the parties in
express reliance upon 6 Del. C. Section 2708. Without limiting the agreement of
the parties set forth in this Section 6.11, in the event that any dispute
arising under this Agreement is subject to, or adjudicated by, the courts of the
State of North Carolina, the parties agree that any such dispute will be
adjudicated by the North Carolina Business Court (with any references in this
Section 6.09 to Delaware courts being deemed to be references to North Carolina
courts and any references in this Section 6.09 to the Chancery Court of the
State of Delaware being deemed to be references to the North Caroline Business
Court).

                  SECTION 6.10. Effectiveness. This Agreement shall become
effective upon the execution of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.11. Termination.

                  (a) Automatic Termination. This Agreement shall automatically
terminate at such time that (i) B&W's Percentage Interest equals 100% or is less
than 15% or (ii) any Person or 13D Group (other than the Investor Parties or any
Person participating in a 13D Group with the Investor Parties) beneficially owns
or controls Voting Stock representing more than 50% of the Voting Power of all
Voting Stock.

                  (b) Termination by BAT and B&W. BAT and B&W shall be entitled
to terminate this Agreement in the event that (i) (A) Reynolds American, the
Board of Directors or any committee of the Board of Directors takes any action,
or fails to take appropriate action, which action, or failure to take action,
would have resulted in a material breach of any of the Board Provisions but for
the fiduciary duty exception set forth in Section 2.08 or (B) an Approval
Termination Event occurs or (ii) the number of Investor Directors serving on the
Board of Directors at any time is less than the number of Investor Directors to
which B&W is entitled at such time pursuant to Section 2.01 (provided


                                       45
<PAGE>


B&W has complied in all material respects and in good faith with the
requirements set forth in this Agreement regarding the nomination of, and voting
for, directors), in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) subject to notice from B&W
and the expiration of a 45-day period in which to cure such action or failure to
act (if such action or failure to act is capable of being cured).

                  (c) Termination of Obligations. BAT and B&W shall be entitled
to terminate Articles IV and V and Sections 2.01(g) and (h) and Sections 2.02(b)
and (c), but the remainder of this Agreement shall continue until otherwise
terminated pursuant to Section 6.11(a) or (b), in the event that the Board of
Directors or Reynolds American willfully and deliberately fails to take
appropriate action, which action, or failure to take action, results in a
material breach of the Board Provisions, subject to notice from B&W and the
expiration of a 45-day period in which to cure such breach or failure (if such
breach or failure is capable of being cured). Reynolds American shall be
entitled to terminate Article II (provided that Section 2.04(c) shall survive
until the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement and Sections
2.01(g)(i) and (h) and 2.02(b) and (c) shall survive until otherwise terminated
pursuant to Section 6.11(a)), but the remainder of this Agreement shall continue
until otherwise terminated pursuant to Section 6.11(a), in the event that BAT or
B&W willfully and deliberately takes any action, or fails to take appropriate
action, which action, or failure to take action, results in a material breach of
Section 4.01 hereof (subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 4.03),
subject to notice from Reynolds American and the expiration of a 45-day period
in which to cure such breach or failure (if such breach or failure is capable of
being cured).

                  (d) Survival. In the event that this Agreement shall
terminate, all provisions of this Agreement shall terminate and shall be void,
except (i) Article III shall survive any such termination until the Investor
Parties no longer hold Registrable Securities, (ii) Section 2.04(c) shall
survive until the fifth anniversary of the date of this Agreement and (iii)
Articles I and VI shall survive any such termination indefinitely. Nothing in
this Section 6.11 will be deemed to release any party from any liability for any
wilful and material breach of this


                                       46
<PAGE>


Agreement or to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by
any other party of its obligations under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.12. Confidentiality. (a) Each of BAT and B&W agree
to maintain, and they shall cause each of their respective Subsidiaries,
directors, officers, employees and other representatives (including any Investor
Director) to maintain, the confidentiality of all material non-public
information obtained by the Investor Parties from Reynolds American or any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective directors, officers, employees or agents,
and not to use such information for any purpose other (i) than the evaluation
