-v- AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is made and entered into as of June 21,
2007, by and among _SiRF TECHNOLOGY HOLDINGS, INC._ , a Delaware corporation
(" _Acquirer_ "), _SPARTACUS I ACQUISITION CORP._ , a California corporation
and wholly owned subsidiary of Acquirer (" _Spartacus I Merger Sub_ "),
_SPARTACUS II ACQUISITION CORP._ , a California corporation and wholly owned
subsidiary of Acquirer (" _Spartacus II Merger Sub_ " and together with
Spartacus I Merger Sub, the " _Merger Subsidiaries_ " ) and _CENTRALITY
COMMUNICATIONS, INC._ , a California corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
solely with respect to Article 6 and Article 9, TEH-TSUNG LAI, as Shareholder
Agent. Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein have the
meanings set forth in Article 10. 

RECITALS:

A. The Boards of Directors of each of Acquirer, Merger Subsidiaries and the
Company have approved this Agreement, and deem it advisable, fair and in the
best interests of their respective stockholders that Acquirer acquire the
Company through the statutory merger of Spartacus I Merger Sub with and into
the Company, pursuant to which the Company would become a wholly owned
subsidiary of Acquirer (the " _First Merger_ "), and, as part of the same
overall transaction, the surviving entity of the First Merger would merge
with and into Spartacus II Merger Sub (the "Second Merger," and together with
the First Merger, the "Mergers") upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the First Merger, this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

B. It is intended that the Mergers are integrated steps in the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and will together qualify as a tax-free
reorganization within the meaning of section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

C. Pursuant to the First Merger, among other things, and subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, (i) all of the outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive Acquirer
Common Stock and cash, and (ii) all Company Options then outstanding (vested
or unvested) shall become exercisable for Acquirer Common Stock, in each case
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein.

D. No later than 1:30 p.m. Pacific Time on the date hereof, the holders of
Company Capital Stock listed on Schedule A (the " _Major Shareholders_ ") will
execute and deliver to Acquirer a Written Consent, pursuant to which, among
other things, the Major Shareholders will (pursuant to Section 603 of the
California Code) irrevocably consent to the approval and adoption of the First
Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby; it being
understood that the failure of any Major Shareholder to timely deliver a duly
executed Written Consent substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit
A_ , will provide Acquirer the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 8.1(h).

E. The Company and Acquirer desire to make certain representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Mergers.



 

-1- NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises, representations
and warranties set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration (the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged by
the parties), intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:

ARTICLE 1

THE MERGER

1.1 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the California
Code, Spartacus I Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company by
filing an agreement of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
California in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit D_ (the "
_Agreement of Merger_ "), whereupon the separate corporate existence of
Spartacus I Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation. The Company as the surviving corporation after the
First Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "First-Step
Surviving Corporation." At the Second Effective Time, Acquirer shall cause the
First-Step Surviving Corporation to merge with and into Spartacus II Merger
Sub by filing an agreement of merger with the Secretary of State of the State
of California in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the "
_Second Step Agreement of Merger_ "), whereupon the separate corporate
existence of the First-Step Surviving Corporation shall cease, and Spartacus
II Merger Sub shall be the surviving corporation (the surviving entity, or its
successor is sometimes referred to herein as the " _Final Surviving
Corporation_ "). The parties to this Agreement agree to treat the First
Merger and the Second Merger as integrated steps in the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement and for any and all federal and state income
tax reporting purposes shall report the transaction as a
single "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of the
Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a "plan of
reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-2(g).

1.2 _Effective Time_.

(a) Unless this Agreement is earlier terminated pursuant to Section 8.1
hereof, the closing of the First Merger (the " _Closing_ ") is expected to
take place on or about August 31, 2007 and will take place no later than five
(5) Business Days following satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth
in Article 7 (except for those conditions that, by their nature, are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction of such conditions
at the Closing), at the offices of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, 2475
Hanover Street, Palo Alto, California, unless another place or time is agreed
to by Acquirer and the Company (the " _Closing Date_ "). On the Closing Date,
the parties hereto shall cause the First Merger to be consummated by filing
the Agreement of Merger (or like instrument) with the Secretary of State of
the State of California, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
California Code (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State
of California of such filing or such later time as may be agreed to by the
parties and set forth in the Agreement of Merger being referred to herein
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in all cases within 5 Business Days
thereafter, Acquirer shall cause the Second Merger to be consummated by
filing the Second Step  



 

-2-  Agreement of Merger (or like instrument) with the Secretary of State of the
State of California, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
California Code (the time of acceptance by the Secretary of State of the
State of California of such filing or such later time as may be agreed to by
the parties and set forth in the Second Step Agreement of Merger being
referred to herein as the " _Second Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effect of the First Merger on Constituent Corporations_. At the Effective
Time, the effect of the First Merger shall be as provided in the applicable
provisions of the California Code. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Spartacus I Merger Sub and the
Company shall vest in the First-Step Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Spartacus I
Merger Sub and the Company shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the First-Step Surviving Corporation.
Following the Second Merger, the effect of the Second Merger shall be as
provided in the applicable provisions of the California Code.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Second Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of Spartacus II Merger Sub and the First-Step Surviving Corporation
shall vest in the Final Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of Spartacus II Merger Sub
and the First-Step Surviving Corporation shall become the debts, liabilities,
obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Final Surviving
Corporation.

1.4 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Surviving Corporations_.

(a) At the Effective Time, the Articles of Incorporation of the First-Step
Surviving Corporation, shall be amended and restated as of the Effective
Time in its entirety to conform to the Articles of Incorporation of Spartacus
I Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time until
thereafter amended as provided by law and such Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the First-Step Surviving Corporation; _provided, however,_ that at
the Effective Time, Article I of the Articles of Incorporation of the First-
Step Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in its entirety to
read as follows: "The name of the corporation is "Centrality Communications,
Inc." The Articles of Incorporation of Spartacus II Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, shall be the Articles of
Incorporation of the Final Surviving Corporation at the Second Effective
Time.

(b) At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the First-Step Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time in their entirety to
be identical to the Bylaws of Spartacus I Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended as provided by such
Bylaws, the Articles of Incorporation of the First-Step Surviving Corporation
and applicable law. The Bylaws of Spartacus II Merger Sub, as in effect
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the
Final Surviving Corporation at the Second Effective Time. 

1.5 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporations_. The directors of
Spartacus I Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the First-Step Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective
Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the First-Step Surviving Corporation, as amended  



 

-3-  pursuant to the foregoing. The directors of Spartacus II Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Final Surviving Corporation from and after the Second Effective Time. The
officers of Spartacus I Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be the officers of the First-Step Surviving Corporation from and after
the Effective Time, each to hold office in accordance with the Bylaws of the
Company, as amended according to the foregoing. The officers of Spartacus II
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be the
officers of the Final Surviving Corporations from and after the Second
Effective Time.

1.6 _Maximum Number of Shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be Issued; Effect on
Outstanding Securities of the Company_. The maximum number of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock to be issued (including Acquirer Common Stock to be
reserved for issuance upon exercise of any of the Company Options to be
assumed by Acquirer as provided herein) in exchange for the acquisition by
Acquirer of all shares of Company Capital Stock which are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and all vested and
unvested Company Options to be assumed by Acquirer which are then outstanding
shall not exceed the sum of the Shareholder Stock Consideration and the
Optionholder Stock Consideration. No adjustment shall be made in the number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock issued in the First Merger as a result of
any consideration (in any form whatsoever) received by the Company from the
date hereof to the Effective Time as a result of any exercise, conversion or
exchange of Company Equity Awards.

1.7 _Merger Consideration_. At the Effective Time:

(a) _Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock (after giving effect to
the conversion of all outstanding shares of Company Preferred Stock into
shares of Company Common Stock as required by Section 5.16) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Company
Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 1.7(d) and any Dissenting
Shares (as provided in Section 1.11)) will be cancelled and extinguished and
converted automatically into the right to receive, upon surrender of the
certificate representing such share of Company Common Stock (or Company
Preferred Stock converted into Company Common Stock) in accordance with the
terms of Section 1.12 hereof, and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the indemnification and escrow
provisions set forth in Article 6 hereof and in the Escrow Agreement, the Per
Share Consideration;  _provided, however,_ in the event Acquirer determines
in its reasonable discretion that the proposed offer and sale of shares of
Acquirer Common Stock contemplated by this Agreement shall not qualify as an
exempt private offering of securities under Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, the parties hereto agree to
cooperate in good faith to amend this Agreement in a manner such that the
offer and sale of Acquirer Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement, as
amended, shall qualify as an exempt private offering of securities.

For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall have the meanings
set forth below:



 

-4- (i) "Acquirer Stock Price" means the average closing price of the Acquirer
Common Stock as listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market during the first

Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise or conversion of all outstanding

Stock owned by the Company or any Subsidiary immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and extinguished without any
conversion thereof and without any further action on the part of Acquirer or
the Company.

(e) _Capital Stock of Spartacus I Merger Sub_. Each share of Spartacus I
Merger Sub common stock which is issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation,
and such shares shall constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock
of the Company after the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
each share certificate of Spartacus I Merger Sub theretofore evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall evidence ownership of such shares of
capital stock of the First-Step Surviving Corporation after the Effective

exclusive owner of the shares of capital stock of the First-Step Surviving
Corporation.

provisions set forth below:

(i) Each unexpired and unexercised Company Option outstanding as of the
Effective Time, whether then- vested or unvested that is eligible to be
registered on a registration statement on Form S-8 (or successor form), shall
be, in connection with the Merger, assumed by Acquirer (the " _Assumed Option_
"), together with the Company Stock Plan.

(ii) Each Assumed Option shall continue to have, and, except for the
amendments described in Section 5.15, be subject to, the same terms and
conditions as were applicable to the Assumed Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including any repurchase rights or vesting provisions),
provided that each Assumed Option shall be exercisable for that number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock as is equal to (1) the Per Option Share Amount
multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were
issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (assuming the Assumed Option was exercisable in full);
_provided, further,_ that the exercise price per share of Acquirer Common
Stock issuable upon exercise of the Assumed Option shall be equal to (1) the
exercise price of the Assumed Option divided by (2) the Per Option Share
Amount (rounded up to the nearest whole cent).

(iii) Except for the amendments described in Section 5.15, it is the intention
of the parties that the assumption of the Company Options shall be effected
in a manner that is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code. The provisions
of this Section 1.7(f) shall be applied consistent with the intent described
in the preceding sentence.



 

-7- (iv) Each unexpired and unexercised Company Option outstanding as of the
Effective Time that is not eligible to be registered on a registration
statement on Form S-8 (or successor form), shall not be assumed by Acquirer
under this Agreement (the " _Unassumed Option_ "). All Unassumed Options will
be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive, for
each share of Company Common Stock underlying such Unassumed Option, a cash
amount equal to the Per Unassumed Option Cash Consideration less the
applicable exercise price in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Company after the Effective Time, the
First-Step Surviving Corporation and Acquirer shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to
this Article 1 such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under any provision of federal, state,
local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
First-Step Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time or Acquirer, as the
case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Capital Stock
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the First-Step
Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time or Acquirer, as the case may
be.

1.8 _Reservation of Shares_. Acquirer will reserve sufficient shares of
Acquirer Common Stock for issuance pursuant to Section 1.7.

 

1.9 _Adjustments to Per Share Stock Consideration_. The Per Share Stock
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect fully the effect of any
stock split, reverse split, stock combination, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Acquirer Common
Stock), reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization or other like
change with respect to Acquirer Common Stock the effective date of which
occurs after the date hereof.

1.10 _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Acquirer Common Stock
will be issued in the First Merger, but in lieu thereof, each holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
share of Acquirer Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of
Acquirer Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall be entitled to
receive from Acquirer an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent)
equal to the product of (a) such fraction, multiplied by (b) the Acquirer
Stock Price. 

1.11 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, any
shares of Company Capital Stock held by a holder who has demanded and
perfected appraisal rights for such shares in accordance with the California
Code and who, as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost
such appraisal or dissenters rights (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Acquirer Common Stock and cash
pursuant to Section 1.7, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to
such rights and to receive such consideration funded solely from Acquirer as
are granted by the California Code.



 

-8- (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 1.11(a) above, if any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock who demands appraisal of such shares under
the California Code shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to
perfect or otherwise) the right to appraisal, then, as of the later of (i) the
Effective Time or (ii) the occurrence of such event, such holders shares
shall automatically be converted into and represent only the right to receive
Acquirer Common Stock and cash as provided in Section 1.7, without interest
thereon, upon surrender to the Company of the certificate representing such
shares in accordance with Section 1.12.

(c) The Company shall give Acquirer (i) prompt notice of its receipt of any
written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock,
withdrawals of such demands, and any other instruments relating to the First
Merger served pursuant to the California Code and received by the Company and
(ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the California Code. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of Acquirer or as may be required
under applicable law, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal of Company Capital Stock or offer to settle or settle
any such demands.

1.12 _Exchange Procedures_.

(a) At the Closing, Acquirer shall (i) deposit with The Bank of New York or
other exchange agent appointed by Acquirer and reasonably acceptable to the
Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Company
Capital Stock, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount equal to (A) the Shareholder
Cash Consideration minus (B) the Escrow Amount (which shall be deposited with
the Escrow Agent); and (ii) make available to the Exchange Agent the number of
shares of Acquirer Common Stock comprising the Shareholder
Stock Consideration, plus cash in an amount estimated to be sufficient for
payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.10 hereof.

(b) Within 5 Business Days following the Effective Time, Acquirer shall
provide or cause to be provided to each holder of record of Company Capital
Stock as of the Effective Time, a letter of transmittal for use in exchanging
certificates representing shares of Company Capital Stock for the Total
Shareholder Consideration (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as Acquirer and the Company may reasonably specify) and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the certificates that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall represent any of such shares
in exchange for payment of the Per Share Consideration for each such share.
Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of such certificates (or affidavit of
loss or destruction in lieu thereof, including any suitable bond or indemnity
that may be required by Acquirer or the Exchange Agent in their sole
discretion), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed and
completed in accordance with the instructions thereto, Acquirer shall promptly
cause the aggregate Per Share Cash Consideration to be paid, and the
aggregate Per Share Stock Consideration to be issued, to the persons entitled
thereto, in such amounts as is equal to the Per Share Cash Consideration and
Per Share Stock Consideration to which such person is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.7, less any required tax withholdings in accordance with the
instructions specified in the applicable letter of transmittal and the
portions thereof to be deposited in the Escrow Fund. No interest will be paid
or will accrue on the amount of Per Share Cash Consideration payable upon the
surrender of any  



 

-9-  such certificate. If the Per Share Consideration is to be paid or issued to
a person other than the registered holder of the certificate surrendered,
it shall be a condition of such payment that the certificate so surrendered
shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that
the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes
required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificate surrendered or establish to the reasonable
satisfaction of Acquirer or the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or
is not applicable.

(c) After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Capital Stock that
were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(d) One hundred and eighty (180) days following the Effective Time,
Acquirer shall be entitled to cause the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made available to
the Exchange Agent that have not been disbursed to holders of certificates or
agreements formerly representing shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding
on the Effective Time, and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look
to Acquirer only as general creditors thereof with respect to the portion of
the Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their certificates or
agreements.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party
hereto shall be liable to any holder of certificates formerly representing
shares of Company Capital Stock for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. The
First-Step Surviving Corporation after the Effective Time shall pay all
charges and expenses in connection with the exchange of cash for Company
Capital Stock.

1.13  _Exemption From Registration_. Acquirer and the Company intend that the
shares of Acquirer Common Stock to be issued pursuant to Section 1.7 to the
holders of Company Capital Stock in connection with the Merger will be issued
in a transaction exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC thereunder
(the " _Securities Act_ ") by reason of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
or Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act, or by reason of
Regulation S as promulgated under the Securities Act, as the case may be.

1.14 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. The portion of
the Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender for exchange of Company
Capital Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have
been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company
Capital Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the
records of the Company of Company Capital Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
certificates representing Company Capital Stock are presented to the Company
or the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and
exchanged as provided in this Article 1. 

1.15 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any such further action is necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the First-Step Surviving
Corporation after the Effective Time or the Final Surviving Corporation
following the Second Merger with full right, title and possession to all  



 

-10-  assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company,
or to effect the assignment to the First-Step Surviving Corporation after
the Effective Time or the Final Surviving Corporation after the Second
Effective Time of any and all Company Intellectual Property created by a
founder, employee or consultant of the Company, or to complete and prosecute
all domestic and foreign intellectual property filings related to such
Company Intellectual Property, the officers and directors of the Company after
the Effective Time or the Surviving Corporation are fully authorized to take,
and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.

1.16 _Escrow Fund_. On the Closing Date, Acquirer shall deposit the Escrow
Amount in the Escrow Fund to be established with Citibank, N.A. or another
third person mutually satisfactory to Acquirer and the Shareholder Agent, as
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The Escrow Fund shall be applied
pursuant to the provisions of Article 6 hereof and the Escrow Agreement in
the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F _(the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

ARTICLE 2

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

Subject to the exceptions set forth in the Disclosure Schedule (each of which
exceptions, in order to be effective, shall clearly indicate the Section and,
if applicable, the Subsection of this Article 2 to which it relates,
delivered herewith and dated as of the date hereof, the Company hereby
represents and warrants to Acquirer as follows:

2.1 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each Subsidiary is a

qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and is in good standing as a

licensing or leasing of its Assets and Properties, or the conduct or nature of
its business, makes such qualification, licensing or admission necessary,
except for such failures to be so duly qualified, licensed or admitted and in
good standing that could not reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect
on the Business or Condition of the Company. Section 2.1 of the Disclosure
Schedule sets forth each jurisdiction where the Company or a Subsidiary is so
qualified, licensed or admitted to do business and separately lists each other
jurisdiction in which the Company or a Subsidiary owns, uses, licenses or
leases its Assets and Properties, or conducts business or has employees or
engages independent contractors.

2.2 _Authority Relative to this Agreement_. Subject only to the requisite

perform its obligations hereunder and thereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The Companys board of directors
has (i) approved this Agreement and declared its  



 

-11-  advisability, (ii) unanimously recommended as of the date of this Agreement
that the shareholders of the Company approve this Agreement, the First Merger

agree to the matters set forth in the Written Consent, and (iii) directed that
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby be submitted for a
vote of the shareholders of the Company in order to obtain the Required
Shareholder Approvals, and no such determination, recommendation or direction
of the board of directors of the Company has been withdrawn, amended, modified
or terminated except as otherwise permitted by this Agreement. The Written
Consent, when and if executed by each of the Major Shareholders, will result
in all of the Required Shareholder Approvals being obtained and shall be
irrevocable. The Required Shareholder Approvals are the only approvals of any
holders of Company Capital Stock that are necessary in connection with the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby (including
the Merger), pursuant to applicable Legal Requirements, the Companys
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws. The execution and delivery by the Company
of this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party
and the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby, and the performance by the Company of its obligations
hereunder and thereunder, have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary action by the board of directors of the Company, and no other action
on the part of the board of directors of the Company or by any officer,
director or equity holder of a Subsidiary is required to authorize the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements to which the Company is a party and the consummation by the
Company of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements to which the Company is a party have been or will
be, as applicable, duly and validly executed and delivered by the
Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery hereof
(and, in the case of the Ancillary Agreements to which Acquirer is a party,
thereof) by Acquirer, each constitutes or will constitute, as applicable, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its respective terms, except as the enforceability

of creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity.

Person, any of its RTL code or computer software and code, in a form other
than object code form, including related programmer comments and annotations,
which may be printed out or displayed in readily human readable form ("

to a Person with regard to such Source Code. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has taken any action that will, or would reasonably be expected to,
result in the disclosure or delivery of any Source Code owned by the Company
or any Subsidiary under any Contract. To the Companys Knowledge, no event has
occurred, and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) will, or would reasonably be expected to,

by the Company in connection with the foregoing. All product performance
comparisons heretofore furnished by the Company to customers or Acquirer
are accurate in all material respects as of the dates so furnished (except

subsequent product performance comparison furnished to the customer before the
customers acquisition of a license on the product covered by the superseded
comparison, the superseding  



 

-23-  comparison shall be accurate in all material respects and the superseded

Business Combination with the Company or any Subsidiary (whether such
subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or is hereafter organized), (d)
make or authorize any statement, recommendation, solicitation or endorsement
in support of any possible Business Combination with the Company or any
Subsidiary (whether such subsidiary is in existence on the date hereof or is
hereafter organized) other than by Acquirer, or (e) authorize or permit any
of the Companys Representatives to take any such action. As of June 5, 2007,
the Company ceased and caused to be terminated any such contacts or
negotiations with any Person relating to any such transaction or Business
Combination. In addition to the foregoing, if the Company receives prior to
the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement any offer, indication
of interest or proposal (formal or informal, oral, written or otherwise)
relating to, or any inquiry or contact from any Person with respect to, a
Competing Proposed Transaction, the Company shall immediately notify Acquirer
thereof, such notice to include the identity of the Person or Persons making
such offer, indication of interest or proposal and the terms thereof, and
will keep Acquirer apprised on a current basis of the status of any such
offer, indication of interest or proposal and of any modifications to the
terms thereof; _provided, however_ , that this  



 

-46-  provision shall not in any way be deemed to limit the obligations of the
Company and its Representatives set forth in the first sentence of this
section. Each of the Company and Acquirer acknowledge that this Section 4.2
was a significant inducement for Acquirer to enter into this Agreement and the
absence of such provision would have resulted in either (i) a material
reduction in the consideration to be paid to the shareholders of the Company
in the Merger or (ii) a failure to induce Acquirer to enter into this
Agreement.

to cause each Assumed Option which was originally granted as an "Incentive
Stock Option" within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code (the " _Assumed
ISOs_ ") to be amended to extend the exercise period of the Assumed ISOs to
120 days from the date of the optionees termination of service; _provided,

approved by Acquirer) (a) executed resolutions of the board of directors of
the Company authorizing such termination and (b) an executed amendment to the
401(k) Plan sufficient to assure compliance with all applicable requirements
of the Code and regulations thereunder so that the tax-qualified status of the

5.19 _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the board of directors of the
Company will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the
terms contemplated hereby and otherwise act to eliminate the effects of any
Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.20 _Company s Auditors_. The Company will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause its management and its independent auditors to facilitate on

Closing Date. Tax Returns of the Company not yet filed for any Tax period that
begins on or before the Closing Date shall be prepared, and each item thereon
treated, in a manner consistent with past practices employed with respect to
the Company (except to the extent the Acquirer and/or the Final Surviving
Corporation determines there is a reasonable basis for determining that a Tax
Return should be prepared and filed or an item reported in a different
manner). Promptly after the Effective Time, but in all cases within 5
Business Days thereafter, Acquirer shall cause the Second Merger to be
consummated in accordance with this Agreement.

5.24 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) Acquirer shall, or shall cause the First-Step Surviving Corporation or

obligation of the Company to the Companys present and former directors and
officers (the " _Indemnified Directors and Officers_ ") pursuant to the terms
of (i) the Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws and (ii) any
indemnification agreements between the Company and the Indemnified Directors
and Officers existing prior to the date hereof and provided or made available
to Acquirer.

(b) This Section 5.24 (i) shall survive the consummation of each of
the Mergers, (ii) is intended to benefit the Indemnified Directors and
Officers and their respective heirs and (iii) is in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Person may have against Acquirer, the First-Step Surviving Corporation
or the Final Surviving Corporation first arising after the Closing Date by
contract or otherwise. This Section 5.24 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnified
Director and Officer under this Section 5.24 without the written consent of
such affected Indemnified Director and Officer.

(c) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time,
Acquirer shall, or shall cause the Final Surviving Corporation to, maintain in
effect, for the benefit of the Companys officers and directors with respect
to their acts and omissions as directors and officers of the Company occurring
prior to the Effective Time, the existing policy  



 

-53-  of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the Company as
of the date of this Agreement in the form delivered by the Company
to Acquirer prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO
Policy_"); _provided, however,_ that (i) Acquirer or the Final Surviving
Corporation may substitute for the Existing DandO Policy a policy or policies
of comparable coverage and (ii) Acquirer or Final Surviving Corporation shall
not be obligated to make annual premium payments to the extent such premiums
exceed 125% of the premiums paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such
insurance (the " _Maximum Premium_ "). In the event any future annual
premiums for the Existing DandO Policy (or any substitute policies) exceed the
Maximum Premium, Acquirer or the Final Surviving Corporation shall be entitled
to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing DandO Policy (or any
substitute policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a
premium equal to the Maximum Premium. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
in this Section 5.24(c) shall prevent Acquirer from purchasing a "tail"
policy for the Existing DandO Policy.

5.25 _Certain Employment Matters_. Acquirer intends to extend offers of
employment to certain individuals employed by the Company as of the date
hereof (such employees, other than the Key Employees, being the " _Continuing
Employees_ "). Accordingly, prior to the Closing Date, Acquirer shall make an
offer of continued "at-will" employment by Acquirer, the First-Merger
Surviving Corporation or the Final Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to
each of the Continuing Employees reflecting terms of employment no less
favorable to such Continuing Employee taken as a whole than that his or her
current terms of employment by the Company as of the date hereof.

Agreement. Subject to the following requirements, the Escrow Agent shall
release the Escrow Fund to the Escrow Participants on the Expiration Date
less (i) any amounts paid to Acquirer prior to such date in accordance with
this Article 6 and the Escrow Agreement, and (ii) any amount that is
reasonably necessary, as reflected in documentation provided by Acquirer to
the Shareholder Agent in good faith, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims
(including costs of defense) concerning facts and circumstances existing prior
to the Expiration Date which claims are specified in any Claim Notice
delivered to the Escrow Agent in good faith prior to the Expiration Date.
Deliveries of cash remaining in the Escrow Fund on the Expiration Date to the
Escrow Participants pursuant to this Section 6.2(c) shall be made ratably in
proportion to their respective contributions to the Escrow Fund.

(d) _Protection of Escrow Fund_. The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the
Escrow Fund during the Escrow Period, shall treat such fund with no greater
care than it gives its own similar property in accordance with the terms of
the Escrow Agreement and not as the property of Acquirer and shall hold and
dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the terms hereof and of
the Escrow Agreement.



 

-56- (e) _Shareholder Agent; Power of Attorney_.

(i) Teh-Tsung Lai shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact (the "
_Shareholder Agent_ ") for and on behalf of the Escrow Participants, to give
and receive notices and communications, to authorize delivery to Acquirer of
cash from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Acquirer, to object to
such deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements
and compromises of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts
and awards of arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Shareholder Agent for the
accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the Escrow
Participants from time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior
written notice to Acquirer and the Shareholder Agent; _provided, however_ ,
that the Shareholder Agent may not be removed unless holders of a two-thirds
interest in the Escrow Fund agree to such removal and to the identity of a
substituted Shareholder Agent. Any vacancy in the position of Shareholder
Agent may be filled by approval of the holders of a majority in interest of
the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be required of the Shareholder Agent, and the
Shareholder Agent shall not receive compensation for its services. Notices or
communications to or from the Shareholder Agent pursuant to Section
9.1 hereof shall constitute notice to or from each of the shareholders of the
Company.

(ii) The Shareholder Agent shall not incur any liability with respect to any
action taken or suffered by it or omitted hereunder as Shareholder Agent while
acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment. The
Shareholder Agent may, in all questions arising hereunder, rely on the advice
of counsel or other appropriate advisors and for anything done, omitted or
suffered in good faith by the Shareholder Agent based on such advice, the
Shareholder Agent shall not be liable to anyone. The Shareholder Agent
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically
set forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be
read into this Agreement or the Voting Agreements against the Shareholder
Agent.

(f) _Actions of the Shareholder Agent_. A decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Shareholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all
the Escrow Participants for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise
issuable to them is deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each of such Escrow Participants, and the Escrow Agent and
Acquirer may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of the
Shareholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of every
such Escrow Participant. The Escrow Agent and Acquirer are hereby relieved
from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in accordance with
such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Shareholder Agent.

(g) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event Acquirer becomes aware of a third-
party claim (a " _Third Party Claim_ ") which Acquirer reasonably expects may
result in a demand against the Escrow Fund, Acquirer shall notify the
Shareholder Agent of such claim, and the Shareholder Agent, as representative
for the Escrow Participants, shall be entitled, at their expense, to
participate in any defense of such claim. Acquirer shall have the right in its
sole discretion to settle any Third Party Claim; _provided, however_ , that
if Acquirer settles any Third Party Claim without the Shareholder Agents
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), such
settlement shall not be dispositive in the event Acquirer makes a
claim against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred
by Acquirer in such settlement. In  



 

-57-  the event that the Shareholder Agent has consented to any such settlement,
the Shareholder Agent shall have no power or authority to object under
any provision of this Article 6 to the amount of any claim by Acquirer
against the Escrow Fund with respect to the amount of Losses incurred by
Acquirer in such settlement.

(h) _Indemnification for Shareholder Agent_. The Shareholder Agent is
expressly authorized to rely upon the advice of advisors and agents.
The Shareholder Agent shall be indemnified and held harmless by the Escrow
Participants from and against any Losses that may be incurred by the
Shareholder Agent arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
performance of the Shareholder Agents duties or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, except as caused by
the Shareholder Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct, including the
legal costs and expenses of defending such Shareholder Agent against any
claim or liability in connection with the acceptance or performance of the
Shareholder Agents duties or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the Escrow Agreement (the " _Shareholder Agent Expenses_ "). Following the
termination of the Escrow Period and the resolution of all pending claims made
by the Acquirer Indemnitees for Losses, the Shareholder Agent shall have the
right to recover the Shareholder Agent Expenses from any remaining portion of
the Escrow Fund prior to any distribution to the Escrow Participants, and
prior to any such distribution, shall deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate setting forth the Shareholder Agent Expenses actually incurred.
Upon receipt of such certificate, the Escrow Agent shall pay such Shareholder
Agent Expenses to the Shareholder Agent. The Shareholder Agent shall be
entitled to reimbursement of any Shareholder Agent Expenses that are not
reimbursed out of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow Participants on a several,
but not joint and several basis. Acquirer shall not have any obligation or
liability for such expenses, costs or losses or for payment of any fees of the
Shareholder Agent.

(i) _Treatment of Payments_. To the extent permitted by law, the parties agree
to treat payments made under this Article 6 as adjustments to the
consideration paid for the sale and transfer of Company Capital Stock.

request) (the " _Debt Financing_ "); _provided, however,_ if such termination
