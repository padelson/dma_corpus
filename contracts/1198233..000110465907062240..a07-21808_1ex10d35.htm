 **AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER**

  

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of August 10, 2007 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is made and entered into by and among Novant Health, Inc., a
North Carolina nonprofit corporation (" _Parent_ "), Stones Merger Corp., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_
"), MQ Associates, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and J.P.
Morgan Partners (BHCA), L.P. (" _JPMP_ "), solely for purposes of Sections
5.11 and 5.12 and Article X and in its capacity as the Stockholders
Representative (as defined in Section 10.1 below).

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of Parent has determined that the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") is advisable and in
the best interests of Parent, and the respective Boards of Directors of
Merger Sub and the Company have each determined that the Merger is advisable
and in the best interests of their respective stockholders;

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees of Parent and the respective Boards of
Directors of Merger Sub and the Company have each approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the Merger upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein;

  

WHEREAS, Parent, in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has
adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger upon the terms and subject to
the conditions set forth herein; and

  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
JPMP, which beneficially owns shares with voting power sufficient to approve
the Merger in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Companys Organizational Documents (as
defined in Section 3.1(c) below), and Parent have entered into an agreement
pursuant to which JPMP has agreed to vote all of the shares of voting stock
of the Company beneficially owned by JPMP in favor of this Agreement and the
Merger and against any transaction or other action that would interfere with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herby (including the
Merger) (the " _Voting Agreement_ ").

  

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
of other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the
parties hereby agree as follows:

  

 **ARTICLE I _ 
  
 THE MERGER_**

  

Section 1.1 _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective Time (as
defined in Section 1.3 below), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the
Company. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving entity
following the Merger (sometimes referred to herein as the " _Surviving_     

 _Corporation_ "). The existence of the Company shall continue unaffected and
unimpaired by the Merger and, as the Surviving Corporation, it shall be
governed by the DGCL.

  

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date to be specified by
the parties, which shall be no later than the third Business Day (as defined
below) following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set
forth in Article VI hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature
are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
of those conditions), at the offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom
LLP, Four Times Square, New York, New York 10036, unless another time, date
or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.  The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to herein as the " _Closing Date_." As used in
this Agreement, the term " _Business Day_ " means a day other than a
Saturday, Sunday or other day on which commercial banks in New York, New York
are authorized or required by Law (as defined in Section 3.3 below) to close.

  

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and by making all other filings or recordings required under the
DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of
Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or
at such subsequent date or time as Parent and the Company shall agree and
specify in the Certificate of Merger. The time at which the Merger becomes
effective is referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_."

  

Section 1.4 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations,
restrictions, disabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and
duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation_.  The
Companys certificate of incorporation, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law. The bylaws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

  

Section 1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation_.  The
directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until the earlier of their resignation
or removal or until their respective successors are duly designated, as the
case may be. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation until the
earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors
are duly designated, as the case may be.

        

 **ARTICLE II _ 
  
 EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE SECURITIES 
 OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB_**

  

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any shares of (i) the Companys Series A Redeemable Preferred Stock, par
value $.001 per share (the " _Series A Preferred Stock_ "), (ii) the
Companys Class A Common Stock, par value $.001 per share (the " _Class
A Common Stock_ "), (iii) the Companys Common Stock, par value $.001 per
share (the " _Common Stock_ "), or (iv) the Companys Series B
Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $.001 per share (the " _Series B
Preferred Stock_ "), the following shall occur:

  

(a) _Series A Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series A Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) hereof and Dissenting
Shares (as defined in Section 2.4 below)) shall be converted into the right
to receive:

  

(i) an amount in cash determined by dividing $45,000,000 by the number of
shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time; and

  

(ii) a contingent right to receive an amount in cash determined by dividing
the Contingent Cash Amount (as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.2) by
the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the
Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the Contingent Cash Amount
exceeds $10,000,000, the amount in cash determined pursuant to this Section
2.1(a)(ii) shall be determined by dividing (x) $10,000,000 by (y) the number
of shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  

(b) _Class A Common Stock_. Each share of Class A Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
cancelled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into a contingent right to receive an amount in cash, if any,
determined by dividing (i) (x) the Contingent Cash Amount (as finally
determined pursuant to Section 2.2) minus (y) $10,000,000, by (ii) the number
of shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time. For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Contingent Cash Amount does not exceed
$10,000,000, such contingent right to receive an amount in cash shall expire
and no amount in cash shall be delivered with respect to the shares of Class
A Common Stock outstanding as of the Effective Time.

  

(c) _Common Stock_. Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
be automatically cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

        

(d) _Series B Preferred Stock_. Each share of Series B Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Dissenting Shares) shall be automatically cancelled and retired and shall
cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

  

(e) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock_. Each share of Series A Preferred
Stock, Class A Common Stock, Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by the
Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), if any, shall be automatically
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be
delivered in respect thereof.

  

(f) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock, par
value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares of the Surviving
Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub common stock are so converted
shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation that are issued and
outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. Following the Effective
Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub common
stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving Corporation.

  

Section 2.2 _Contingent Cash Amount_. The Contingent Cash Amount shall be
determined as set forth in this Section 2.2.

  

(a) " _Contingent Consideration_ " means (i) in the event that the Surviving
Corporations 2008 Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in Section 2.2(d) below)
equals or exceeds Target EBITDA (as defined in Section 2.2(b) below), then
Contingent Consideration shall mean $35,000,000 and (ii) in the event that
2008 Adjusted EBITDA is less than Target EBITDA (the amount by which 2008
Adjusted EBITDA is less than Target EBITDA is referred to as the " _EBITDA
Deficit_ "), then Contingent Consideration shall mean $35,000,000 minus the
product of (x) the EBITDA Deficit multiplied by (y) four (but in no event
shall the Contingent Consideration be less than zero).

  

(b) " _Target EBITDA_ " means $53,000,000, _provided_ that if any of the
Companys outpatient diagnostic imaging centers (each a " _Facility_ "
and, collectively, the " _Facilities_ ") in operation as of the date of
this Agreement are sold or otherwise divested by Parent (including pursuant
to an asset swap) or closed (other than in the context of consolidating two
or more Facilities, which consolidation shall be accomplished, if at all, in
accordance with the last sentence of Section 2.2(h)) (each a " _Divested
Facility_ "), Target EBITDA shall mean $53,000,000 minus, for each Divested
Facility, the amount set forth in Exhibit 2.2(b) corresponding to such
Divested Facility.

  

(c) _2008 Statements_. Within 90 calendar days after the end of the
Surviving Corporations fiscal year ending December 31, 2008, Parent shall
deliver to the Stockholders Representative (i) a consolidated income
statement of the Surviving Corporation for (x) the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2008 (the " _2008 Income Statement_ ") and (y) the period
beginning July 1, 2008 and ending December 31, 2008 (the " _Q3/Q4 2008 Income
Statement_ "), in each case prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "),

        

applied in a manner consistent with the accounting policies and methods
employed in the financial statements contained in the Companys Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006, and (ii) a
statement (the " _2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement_ ") setting forth Parents
calculation of 2008 Adjusted EBITDA determined (A) in accordance with the
2008 Adjusted EBITDA definition set forth in Section 2.2(d) and (B) on the
basis of the 2008 Income Statement and the Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement.

  

(d) " _2008 Adjusted EBITDA_ " has the meaning set forth on Exhibit 2.2(d).

  

(e) _Review by the Stockholders  Representative_.  The Stockholders
Representative shall have 60 calendar days after the delivery to the
Stockholders Representative of the 2008 Income Statement, the Q3/Q4 2008
Income Statement and the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement (the " _Stockholders
 Representative Review Period_") in which to notify Parent in writing (the "
_Stockholders  Representative Objection Notice_") of any good faith
disagreement with the 2008 Income Statement, the Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement
and/or the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement, setting forth in reasonable detail
(i) the items or amounts with which Stockholders Representative disagrees
and the basis for such disagreement and (ii) the Stockholders
Representatives proposed adjustments to the 2008 Income Statement, the Q3/Q4
2008 Income Statement and/or the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement
(collectively, the " _Stockholders  Representative Objection_"). If the
Stockholders Representative delivers a written acceptance of the 2008
Adjusted EBITDA Statement at any time during the Stockholders Representative
Review Period or does not deliver a Stockholders Representative Objection
Notice within the Stockholders Representative Review Period, the
Stockholders Representative shall be deemed to agree in all respects with
the 2008 Income Statement, the Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement and the 2008
Adjusted EBITDA Statement and the items and amounts reflected thereon shall
be final and binding.

  

(f) _Review by Accountants_. If a Stockholders Representative Objection
Notice is properly and timely delivered, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall use good faith efforts to resolve their differences with
respect to the Stockholders Representative Objection within 30 calendar days
after Parents receipt of the Stockholders Representative Objection Notice.
If Parent and the Stockholders Representative resolve their differences with
respect to the 2008 Income Statement, the Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement and/or
the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement within such 30-day period, the 2008 Income
Statement, the Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement and/or the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA
Statement shall be immediately modified as necessary to reflect such
agreement and, as so modified, shall be final and binding.  Any differences
with respect to the Stockholders Representative Objection not resolved by
Parent and the Stockholders Representative within such 30-day period shall
be submitted for the purpose of resolving such dispute to such nationally
recognized public accounting firm as shall be mutually agreed upon by Parent
and the Stockholders Representative and, if not so mutually agreed upon
within ten calendar days, shall be Deloitte and Touche (such public accounting
firm, the " _Accountants_ "). The Accountants shall be instructed to
render their decision in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
shall consider only those items or amounts on the 2008 Income Statement, the
Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement and/or in the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement as
to which the Stockholders Representative has, in the Stockholders
Representative Objection Notice, disagreed and such other issues as may
reasonably be affected by the items as to which the Stockholders
Representative has so disagreed. The Accountants shall deliver to

        

Parent and the Stockholders Representative, as promptly as practicable, but
no later than 45 calendar days after the Accountants are engaged, a written
report setting forth their resolution and, if applicable, their calculation
of the disputed items or amounts. In no event shall the Accountants
determination result in 2008 Adjusted EBITDA that is greater than that set
forth in the Stockholders Representative Objection Notice or less than that
set forth in the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement. The parties shall promptly
comply with all reasonable requests by the Accountants for information,
books, records and similar items. Upon delivery of the Accountants report
to Parent and the Stockholders Representative, such report and the
calculations set forth therein shall be final and binding. The fees and
expenses relating to such review and report from the Accountants shall be
allocated between the parties in inverse proportion to the resolution of the
disagreements by the Accountants such that the party whose determination of
2008 Adjusted EBITDA as first submitted to the Accountants is closer to the
Accountants determination of 2008 Adjusted EBITDA pays a smaller percentage
of such fees and expenses.

  

(g) _Cooperation_. Each of Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders
Representative, on the other hand, shall provide reasonable cooperation and
assistance to each other in the preparation of the 2008 Income Statement, the
Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement and the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement and in the
conduct of the reviews referred to in this Section 2.2, including Parent
providing reasonable access to the books, records, work papers and personnel
of the Company.

  

(h) _Operation of the Surviving Corporation_. Parent agrees that from and
after the Closing Date and until and including December 31, 2008 (the "
_Earn-Out Period_ "), Parent shall (i) operate the Surviving Corporation as a
stand-alone, separate entity and in a manner consistent with the past
practices and the ordinary course of business of the Company prior to the
Closing and (ii) ensure that the Surviving Corporation has adequate
capital as set forth in the Companys 2008 capital budget previously provided
to Parent and working capital as otherwise needed to conduct its business in
the ordinary course as conducted prior to the Closing.  Parent acknowledges
and agrees that during the Earn-Out Period management of the Surviving
Corporation will attempt to maximize 2008 Adjusted EBITDA and Parent agrees
to cooperate, to the extent commercially reasonable, with those efforts
(including assisting managements efforts to obtain increased reimbursement
rates from commercial payors (other than as described in the next sentence)).
** **In furtherance thereof, Parent agrees to use commercially reasonable
efforts during the Earn-Out Period to add each Facility located in North
Carolina to Parents material commercial payor contracts where doing so would
result in reimbursement rates (in the aggregate) greater than the
reimbursement rates of such Facility as of the Closing Date; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that, for purposes of this sentence, Parent, the Company and the
Stockholders Representative acknowledge and agree that Parent shall
be deemed to have used commercially reasonable efforts in those instances in
which it has contacted such commercial payor and engaged in good faith
negotiations with such commercial payor regarding increased reimbursement
rates for the Facilities and that in no event shall Parent be required to
make any concessions or agree to other terms in exchange for such
increased reimbursement rates that Parent determines, in good faith, are not
in the best interests of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving
Corporation) on an aggregate basis (disregarding for the purpose of such
determination any impact such higher reimbursement rates would have on
Parents obligation to pay the Contingent Consideration pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement). Parent

        

agrees that during the Earn-Out Period it will not cause the Surviving
Corporation to consolidate two or more Facilities without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Representative, and Parent and the Stockholders
Representative agree that, in connection with any request for such consent,
Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate, in good faith,
with respect to an appropriate adjustment, if any, to the Target EBITDA to
reflect the proposed consolidation.

  

(i) _Acceleration_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Contingent Consideration shall be immediately due and
payable in the event that (i) prior to the date of the first to occur of (x)
the delivery by the Stockholders Representative of a written acceptance of
the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement, (y) the expiration of the
Stockholders Representative Review Period without the delivery of a
Stockholders Representative Objection Notice and (z) the final resolution of
the Stockholders Representative Objection pursuant to this Section 2.2,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, terminate (other
than for willful misconduct or malfeasance or "cause" (as defined in such
persons employment agreement, if any)) or demote from their current position
with the Company, any two of Chris Winkle, Todd Andrews, Todd Latz, Daniel
Schaefer and Bruce Elder, or (ii) prior to December 31, 2008, Parent conveys,
or causes the Surviving Corporation to convey, to any Person other than
a wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation, Facilities
representing in excess of $20,000,000 of Target EBITDA (based on Exhibit
2.2(b)) (including by virtue of multiple conveyances over time).

  

(j) The " _Initial Contingent Cash Amount_ " means an amount, but not less
than zero, equal to (i) the Contingent Consideration minus (ii) the sum of
(x) the Escrow Amount (as defined in Section 2.2(k) below) and (y) the sum
of (A) any amounts paid to or on behalf of Parent Indemnified Parties
in connection with undisputed and/or resolved claims for indemnification
pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement and (B) Parents good faith
estimate of the dollar amount of any unresolved claims for indemnification
actually made by Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article VII of this
Agreement (the sum of clause (A) and clause (B) referred to as the "
_Aggregate Indemnity Claim Amount_ ").

  

(k) The " _Escrow Amount_ " means $10,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that
if (i) the Contingent Consideration minus (ii) the Aggregate Indemnity Claim
Amount is less than $10,000,000, then the Escrow Amount shall mean
such remaining amount.

  

(l) The " _Second Contingent Cash Amount_ " means an amount, but not less
than zero, equal to (i) the Escrow Amount minus (ii) the sum of (x) any
amounts paid to or on behalf of Parent Indemnified Parties in connection with
undisputed and/or resolved claims for indemnification pursuant to
indemnification claims made after March 31, 2009 and on or prior to March 31,
2010 pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iii) of this Agreement and (y) Parents good
faith estimate of the dollar amount of any unresolved claims for
indemnification actually made by Parent Indemnified Parties after March 31,
2009 and on or prior to March 31, 2010 pursuant to Section 7.2(a)(iii) of
this Agreement.

  

(m) " _Subsequent Contingent Cash Amounts_ " means amounts which were
deducted pursuant to Section 2.2(j)(ii)(y)(B) or Section 2.2(l)(ii)(y) from
amounts otherwise payable and which amounts are not required to be paid to or
on behalf of Parent Indemnified Parties upon final resolution of the relevant
claim for indemnification.

        

(n) The " _Contingent Cash Amount_ " means the sum of (i) the Initial
Contingent Cash Amount, if any, (ii) the Second Contingent Cash Amount, if
any, and (iii) all Subsequent Contingent Cash Amounts, if any.

  

(o) _Timing of Initial Distribution_. The Initial Contingent Cash Amount, if
any, shall be distributed to the former holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Class A Common Stock, as applicable, in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Article II, on the date five Business Days
after the earliest to occur of either (i) the delivery by the Stockholders
Representative of a written acceptance of the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement
or (ii) the expiration of the Stockholders Representative Review Period;
_provided_ that if the 2008 Income Statement, the Q3/Q4 2008 Income Statement
or the 2008 Adjusted EBITDA Statement is disputed pursuant to this Section
2.2, any undisputed amounts owing in respect of the Initial Contingent Cash
Amount shall be distributed on the date five Business Days after the delivery
by the Stockholders Representative of the Stockholders Representative
Objection Notice and any disputed amount of the Initial Contingent Cash
Amount shall be distributed on the date five Business Days after the final
resolution of such dispute.

  

(p) _Deposit Into Escrow_. Concurrently with the first distribution of any
part of the Initial Contingent Cash Amount, Parent shall deposit the Escrow
Amount into an escrow account pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreement
to be entered into among Parent, the Stockholders Representative and the
escrow agent (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), the form of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit 2.2(p) (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). In the event the Escrow Amount
is less than $10,000,000 (resulting in there being no Initial Contingent Cash
Amount to distribute), the Escrow Amount shall be deposited into the escrow
account on the date on which the Initial Contingent Cash Amount would have
been distributed if such amount was greater than zero.

  

(q) _Timing of Second Distribution_. The Second Contingent Cash Amount, if
any, shall be distributed to the former holders of shares of Series A
Preferred Stock and Class A Common Stock, as applicable, in accordance with

Business Days after such amount is released from the escrow account pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement.

  

(r) _Timing of Subsequent Distribution_. Each Subsequent Contingent Cash
Amount, if any, shall be distributed to the former holders of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock and Class A Common Stock, as applicable, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article II, no later than
the date five Business Days after the final resolution of the relevant
indemnification claim.

  

(s) _Financial Reports_. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
deliver to the Stockholders Representative (i) not later than 30 days after
the end of each calendar month, financial statements of the Surviving
Corporation as of the end of, and for, such month, as produced by management
of the Surviving Corporation in the ordinary course of business (which shall
be substantially comparable to the monthly financial statements produced by
management of the Company in the ordinary course of business as conducted
prior to the date of this Agreement), and (ii) not later than 45 days after
the end of each fiscal quarter or, in the case of any fourth quarter, not
later than 90 days after the end of each fourth quarter (x) if the Surviving
Corporation does not otherwise file with the SEC (as defined in the preamble
to

        

Article III below) a Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or an Annual Report on
Form 10-K, as applicable, a balance sheet of the Surviving Corporation as of
the end of each fiscal quarter and the related statements of income and cash
flows, in each case, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied in a manner
consistent with the application of GAAP in the financial statements contained
in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2006, and (y) for the first three fiscal quarters of 2008, a calculation of
2008 Adjusted EBITDA for such quarter calculated in accordance with this

Section 2.3 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Exchange Procedures_. Immediately following the Effective Time, Parent
shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, to each holder of certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock or Class A Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
"), upon surrender to Parent of one or more Certificates for cancellation,
the amount of cash which such holder of Certificates has the right to
receive, if any, pursuant to Section 2.1 and Section 2.2 (such amounts
referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

  

(b) _Transfer Taxes_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person (as defined in Section 3.1(d) below) other than the Person
in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a
condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (ii) the
Person requesting such payment shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent
that any Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Certificate has been paid or is not payable.

  

(c) _Withholding Tax_. Each of the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Article II such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax
Law, including any withholding from any payment that is treated as wages
or compensation for the performance of services.  To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Capital Stock_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Class A
Common Stock, Common Stock or Series B Preferred Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged, if applicable, as provided in this
Article II. All cash paid in respect of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock and the shares of Class A Common Stock (if any) in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares.

  

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees and agents shall be liable to
any Person in respect of

        

any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered prior to five years after the Effective Time, or immediately
prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate
would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority (as defined in Section 3.4 below), any such cash shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent shall pay, or cause to be
paid, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, such Merger
Consideration as may be required pursuant to this Article II; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent
to the payment thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may reasonably direct
as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against Parent in respect of
the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  

Section 2.4 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Series A Preferred Stock, Class A Common
Stock, Common Stock and Series B Preferred Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by
holders of such shares who properly exercise appraisal rights, if any, with
respect thereto in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be exchangeable for the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, if any, or cancelled, as applicable, and holders of
such Dissenting Shares will be entitled only to receive payment of the
appraised value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of such
Section 262, unless and until such holders fail to perfect or effectively
withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under the DGCL. If,
after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively
withdraws or loses such right, such shares will thereupon be treated as if
they had been converted into, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, or cancelled without
consideration therefor, as applicable. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisals of shares of
Series A Preferred Stock, Class A Common Stock, Common Stock and Series B
Preferred Stock. The Surviving Corporation shall provide the Stockholders
Representative the opportunity (at the Stockholders Representatives sole
cost and expense) to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under the DGCL. The Surviving Corporation
shall not, except with the prior written consent of the Stockholders
Representative, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or
offer to settle or settle any such demands.

Report filed or furnished to the SEC by the Company, and in either case,

end audit adjustments). The consolidated balance sheets (including the
related notes) included in such Company Financial Statements (if applicable,
as updated, amended, restated or corrected in a subsequent Company Filed SEC
Report) fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial
position of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries at the respective dates
thereof, and the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders equity
and cash flows (in each case, including the related notes) included in such
Company Financial Statements (if applicable, as updated, amended, restated or
corrected in a subsequent Company Filed SEC Report) fairly present, in all
material respects, the consolidated statements of operations, stockholders

statements, and (y) to maintain accountability for assets; (iii) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared
with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is
taken with respect to any differences.

  

(e) The Companys "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) are reasonably designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications of the principal executive officer and principal
financial officer of the Company required under the Exchange Act with respect
to such reports.

Section 5.2 _Non-Solicitation_.

  

(a) From and after the date hereof and continuing through the Closing Date,
the Company shall not, and the Company shall cause the Company Subsidiaries
not to, directly or indirectly, authorize or permit any of their respective
officers, directors, employees, agents or representatives (including
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, consultants and
accountants retained by or on behalf of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary) (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, directly or indirectly,
(i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or take any other action designed
to facilitate any Takeover Proposals (as defined below), (ii) enter into any
agreement with respect to any Takeover Proposal or (iii) engage or otherwise
participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any
information with respect to, or otherwise cooperate with, any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal.
The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and its
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate all existing discussions
or negotiations with any Person with respect to any proposal that
constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a Takeover Proposal.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval, in response to a bona fide written Takeover Proposal
that the board of directors of the Company determines (after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation) constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, a
Superior Proposal (as defined below), and which Takeover Proposal was
not solicited after the date hereof, was made after the date hereof and did
not otherwise result from a breach of this Section 5.2(a), the Company may,
if the board of directors of the Company determines (after receiving the
advice of outside counsel) that failure to take such actions would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and subject to
compliance with this Section 5.2(a) and Section 5.2(b) and after giving
Parent written notice of such determination, (x) furnish information with
respect to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to a customary
confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall include a customary
"standstill" or similar covenant) not less restrictive of such person than
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.4(c) below);
_provided_ that (A) all such information has previously been provided to
Parent or is provided to Parent at the same time it is provided to such
Person and (B) such customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides
the right for the Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement,
including Section 5.2(b), and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations
with the Person making such Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed

        

that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.2(a) by
any Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.2(a) by the Company.

  

(b) Except where the board of directors of the Company determines (after
receiving the advice of outside counsel) that failure to do so would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, the Company
agrees not to, and to cause the Company Subsidiaries not to, release any
Person from, or waive any provision of, any confidentiality or standstill
agreement that relates to the Company or any Company Subsidiary. The Company
shall notify Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within 24 hours)
orally, and promptly thereafter in writing, if any Person makes any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Takeover Proposal and shall describe in reasonable detail the identity of any
such Person and the substance and material terms and conditions of any such
Takeover Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall (i) keep Parent fully and
promptly informed of the status and material details (including any change to
any material term thereof) of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii)
provide to Parent promptly after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of
all correspondence and other written material sent or provided to the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the
terms or conditions of any Takeover Proposal.

  

(c) The term " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
from any Person relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to,
any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a
series of transactions, of assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more
of the revenues, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any person beneficially owning 15% or more of any
class of equity securities of the Company, or any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint
venture, binding share exchange or similar transaction involving the Company
pursuant to which any Person or the stockholders of any person would own 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of any resulting
parent company of the Company, other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

  

(d) The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide Takeover Proposal
(provided that for purposes of this definition references to 15% in the
definition of "Takeover Proposal" shall be deemed to be references to 50%)
which the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the stockholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account
all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of such proposal
and this Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent in response to such offer or otherwise)) and (ii)
reasonably capable of being completed, taking into account all financial,
legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal.

Section 5.3 _Cancellation of Stock Options and Warrants_.

  

(a) Effective not later than the Effective Time, the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide that, not later than the Effective
Time, the Stock Option Plan shall be terminated and the Stock Options shall
be cancelled without the payment of any consideration in respect thereof and
that, from and after the Effective Time, neither the Stock Option Plan nor
the Stock Options shall be of any further force or effect.

  

(b) Effective not later than the Effective Time, the Company shall have taken
all actions necessary to provide that, not later than the Effective Time, the
warrant to purchase 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock issued to an affiliate
of JPMP (the " _Warrant_ ") shall be cancelled without the payment of any
consideration in respect thereof and that, from and after the Effective Time,
the Warrant shall be of no further force or effect.

  

Section 5.4 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

  

(a) From and after the date hereof and continuing through the Closing Date,
the Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, cooperate
with Parent and its representatives during normal business hours and provide
Parent and its employees, accountants, attorneys and other representatives
acting on behalf of Parent with reasonable access during normal business
hours to, and permit such Persons to review, the Companys Assets (including
Real Property), books, Contracts, accounts and records (including all
studies, Phase I assessments, analyses and test results in the possession,
custody or control of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their
respective Affiliates relating to the environmental conditions of any real
property now or previously owned or operated by the Company or any Company
Subsidiary), and shall provide as promptly as practicable such other
information to Parent and its representatives as they may reasonably request;
_provided_ that (i) any such access and review shall be granted and conducted
in such a manner so as not to interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the
business of the Company or any Company Subsidiary and (ii) the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries shall not be required to disclose any information
the disclosure of which is restricted by applicable Law or Contract or
information directly relating to the proposed sale of the Company.

  

(b) From and after the date hereof and continuing through the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to Parent copies of the monthly unaudited balance
sheet of the Company as of the end of each month and the related unaudited
statements of operations and cash flows of the Company for such months, in
each case, prepared in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

  

(c) Without limiting the terms thereof, the Confidentiality and Non-
Disclosure Agreement, dated as of January 31, 2007, as amended (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company shall govern
the obligations of Parent, the Company and their respective representatives
with respect to the non-public information furnished or made available to
them pursuant to this Section 5.4 or otherwise.

  

Section 5.5 _HSR Act Filings; Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Further
Assurances_.

  

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) make or cause to be made the
filings required of such party under the HSR Act with respect to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable after the date of this

        

Agreement, but in no event later than 13 Business Days after the date hereof
(such deadline being subject to the parties cooperation as required by this
Section 5.5), (ii) comply at the earliest practicable date with any request
under the HSR Act for additional information, documents or other materials
received by such party from the United States Federal Trade Commission or the
United States Department of Justice or any other Governmental Authority in
respect of such filings or such transactions, and (iii) act in good faith and
reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any such filing
(including, if requested by the other party, to accept all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested by the other party in connection
therewith) and in connection with resolving any investigation or other
inquiry of any such agency or other Governmental Authority under any
Antitrust Laws (as defined in Section 5.5(b) below) with respect to any such
filing or any such transaction. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable Laws, each party to this Agreement shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to furnish to each other all information required for any
application or other filing to be made pursuant to any applicable Laws in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party to this Agreement shall give the other party reasonable
prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed understanding,
undertaking or agreement with, any Governmental Authority regarding any such
filings or any such transaction. None of the parties to this Agreement
shall independently participate in any meeting, or engage in any
substantive conversation, with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
such filings, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party
prior notice of the meeting or conversation and, unless prohibited by such
Governmental Authority, the opportunity to attend or participate. The parties
to this Agreement will consult and cooperate with one another in connection
with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments,
opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party to this
Agreement in connection with proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or
other Antitrust Laws. Parent shall take the lead in coordinating any filings
and obtaining any necessary approvals under the HSR Act or any other federal
or state antitrust Laws.

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.5(d), each of Parent and the Company shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act, the
Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as
amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other United
States federal or state Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade (collectively, " _Antitrust Laws_ "). In connection therewith and
subject to Section 5.5(d), if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as inconsistent with or violative
of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the Company shall (by negotiation,
litigation or otherwise) cooperate and use its commercially reasonable
efforts vigorously to contest and resist any such action or proceeding,
including any administrative or judicial action, and to have vacated, lifted,
reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by vigorously
pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal, unless,
by mutual agreement, Parent and the Company decide that litigation is not in
their respective best interests. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any
other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this Section 5.5 shall limit
the

        

right of a party to this Agreement to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1(c), so long as such party to this Agreement has until that time
complied in all material respects with its obligations under this Section
5.5.  Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take such action as may be required to cause the
expiration of the notice periods under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws
with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as promptly as possible after the execution of this Agreement.

  

(c) Subject to Section 5.5(d), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees
to use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
(i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions or nonactions, waivers,
consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders and approvals from
Governmental Authorities and the making of all other necessary registrations
and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities, if any), (ii)
the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers from third parties
related to or required in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are necessary to consummate
the Merger or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by, and to
fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and (iv) the providing of
all such information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries, its Affiliates
and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates officers, directors, employees and
partners as may be reasonably requested in connection with any of the matters
set forth in Section 5.5(a), Section 5.5(b) or this Section 5.5(c).

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 5.5, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Antitrust Laws by any Governmental Authority with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to
divest any of its businesses or assets, or take or agree to take any other
action or agree to any limitation or restriction, that the Board of Trustees
of Parent reasonably determines in good faith, after considering the advice
of its management and legal and financial advisors, (i) to be materially
adverse to Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) would
materially impair the overall benefits expected, as of the date hereof, to be
realized from the acquisition of the Company.

  

Section 5.6 _Publicity_. The Company shall not, and shall not permit the
Company Subsidiaries to, and Parent and its Affiliates shall not, issue
any press release or public announcement concerning this Agreement, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby without obtaining the
prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless, in the reasonable
judgment of the Company or Parent, as applicable, disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law; _provided_ that to the extent required by
applicable Law, the party intending to make such release or announcement
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts consistent with such applicable
Law to consult with the other party with respect to the text thereof.

  

Section 5.7 _Notification of Certain Events_. From and after the date hereof
and continuing through the Closing Date:

        

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of (i) the occurrence or
existence of (x) the breach in any material respect of a representation,
warranty or covenant made by the Company in this Agreement, or any other
fact, circumstance or event, in either case, that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay any condition precedent to any
partys obligations from being satisfied, and/or (y) a Company Material
Adverse Effect; (ii) any notice or other communication (other than routine
notices or communications in the ordinary course of business) from any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; or (iii) any written notice or other written
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby; and

  

(b) Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company of (i) the occurrence or
existence of the breach in any material respect of a representation, warranty
or covenant made by Parent and Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any other
fact, circumstance or event, in either case, that would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay any condition precedent to any
partys obligations from being satisfied; (ii) any notice or
other communication (other than routine notices or communications) from
any Governmental Authority with respect to the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iii) any written notice or other
written communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated hereby.

  

Section 5.8 _Employee Matters_.

  

(a) _Employees and Compensation_. For a period of at least twelve
months beginning on the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of
its Affiliates to, provide each individual who is employed by the Company or
a Company Subsidiary on the Closing Date (each, a " _Business Employee_ ")
who remains employed by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (a " _Continuing Employee_ "), with a position
providing base pay and bonus opportunity that is at least equal to the base
pay provided to each such Continuing Employee by the Company or the
applicable Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, or may cause one of its Affiliates
to, reduce base pay and bonus opportunity of a Continuing Employee pursuant
to the performance enhancement initiative disclosed to Parent by the Company
prior to the date of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Section 5.8 will limit the right of Parent or any of its
Affiliates to terminate or suspend the employment of any Continuing Employee
after the Closing or, except as expressly provided in this Section 5.8, to
discontinue or modify the benefits provided to any such employee.

  

(b) _Employee Benefits_. For a period of at least twelve months beginning on
the Closing Date, Parent shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,
continue to provide the Continuing Employees for so long as the Continuing
Employee remains so employed, with employee benefit plans and policies which
are, in the aggregate, substantially similar to those provided under the
Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing Date, except that Parent shall
not be required to continue under any Benefit Plan any investment fund
intended to invest primarily or exclusively in capital stock of the Company,
or any equity-based compensation plans. Parent agrees that for any employee
benefit plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates made available to the
Continuing Employees after the Closing, such employees will receive credit
for the years of service credited to them prior to the Closing by the Company
or a Company Subsidiary for the purpose of determining eligibility and
vesting under such employee benefit

        

plan and, with respect to any applicable vacation pay plan only, for the
purpose of determining the amount of accrued benefits under such plan;
_provided_ , _however_ , that such recognition of service shall not result in
a duplication of benefits for the same period of service. With respect to any
welfare plan in which employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
are eligible to participate after the Closing Date, Parent shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to participation and
coverage requirements applicable to such employees to the extent such
conditions were satisfied under the welfare plans of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) provide each such
employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the
Closing Date in satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements to the extent applicable under any such plan.

  

(c) _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Section 5.8 shall
not confer upon any person other than the parties to this Agreement any
rights, benefits or remedies, and no provision of this Section 5.8 is
intended to be or shall be deemed an amendment of any Benefit Plan.

  

(d) _Cooperation_. The Company and Parent shall reasonably coordinate and
cooperate with respect to employee communications relating to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement from and after the date
hereof and through the Closing.  Parent and the Company agree to reasonably
cooperate in order to facilitate all provisions of this Section 5.8.

  

Section 5.9 _WARN Act_.

  

(a) On or before the Closing Date, the Company shall provide Parent with a
list of the name and site of employment of any and all employees of the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries who have experienced, or will experience,
an employment loss or layoff, as defined by WARN, requiring notice to
employees in the event of a closing or layoff as required by WARN, within 90
days prior to the Closing Date. The Company shall update this list up to,
and including, the Closing Date.

  

(b) The Company shall not, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to,
at any time within 90 days before the Closing Date, without complying fully
with the notice requirements and other requirements of WARN, effectuate (i) a
plant closing as defined in WARN affecting any site of employment or one or
more facilities or operating units within any site of employment of the
Company; (ii) a mass layoff as defined in WARN affecting any site of
employment of the Company; or (iii) any similar action under WARN requiring
notice to employees in the event of an employment loss or layoff.

  

Section 5.10 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement
of any stockholder litigation against the Company and its directors relating
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that no such settlement shall be agreed to without
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except that, to the extent Parent is also a party to the
litigation, Parent shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which
does not include the full release of Parent and its Affiliates.

        

Section 5.11 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. From and after the date hereof
and through the third anniversary of the Closing Date, JPMP shall not, and
shall cause its agents (including CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC (" _CCMP_ "))
and controlled Affiliates not to, without the prior written consent of
Parent, directly or indirectly, solicit or hire any employee of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary listed in Section 5.11 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule; _provided_ ,  _however_ , the foregoing shall not prohibit JPMP or
any of its agents (including CCMP) and controlled Affiliates from soliciting
or hiring any such employee who is no longer employed by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary and has not been an employee of the Company or a Company
Subsidiary for at least six months prior to such solicitation or employment
by JPMP or any of its agents (including CCMP) or controlled Affiliates.

  

Section 5.12 _Nondisclosure of Proprietary Information_. From and after the
date hereof and through the third anniversary of the Closing Date, JPMP shall
not, and shall cause its agents (including CCMP) and controlled Affiliates
not to, at any time, make use of, divulge or otherwise disclose to Persons
other than Parent, directly or indirectly, any material trade secret or
material proprietary or confidential information concerning the business or
policies of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that JPMP or its agents
(including CCMP) or controlled Affiliates may have learned in the course of
its investment in the Company or in the course of having representatives
serve as directors of the Company or otherwise. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither JPMP nor its agents (including CCMP) or
controlled Affiliates shall have any obligation hereunder for that portion of
such material proprietary or confidential information which is
independently developed by or for JPMP or its agents (including CCMP) or
controlled Affiliates, which is rightfully received by JPMP or its agents
(including CCMP) or controlled Affiliates from a third party, is disclosed by
the Company or Company Subsidiaries to others without any restriction on use
and disclosure, is approved for release after the Closing by written consent
of the Company or is generally publicly available.

  

Section 5.13 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in
this Agreement, Parent, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall each bear its own direct and indirect fees and expenses in connection
with the investigation, negotiations, and consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including all direct and indirect
expenses, financial advisory, legal and accounting fees.

  

Section 5.14 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance_.

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past and present directors,
officers and employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (the " _D andO
Indemnified Parties_") against any and all losses, damages, liabilities,
deficiencies, claims, interests, awards, judgments, penalties, costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees, costs and other out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in investigating, preparing or defending the foregoing)
arising out of or relating to any threatened or actual Action, investigation
or arbitration based in whole or in part on or arising out of or relating in
whole or in part to the fact that such person is or was a director or officer
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether pertaining to any matter
existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date and whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after, the Closing Date (the " _D andO Indemnified
Liabilities_"), including all DandO Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or
in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or relating to this
Agreement or

        

the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case to the full extent a
corporation is permitted under applicable Law and Organizational Documents in
effect on the date hereof to indemnify such person (and Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to pay expenses in
advance of the final disposition of any such Action, investigation or
arbitration to each DandO Indemnified Party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the
person to whom such expenses are advanced must provide an undertaking to the
Surviving Corporation to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination shall have become
final) that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

  

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any such Action,
investigation or arbitration is brought against any DandO Indemnified Party
(whether arising before or after the Closing Date), (i) the DandO Indemnified
Party may retain counsel satisfactory to it and reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, and Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries to, pay all fees and expenses of such counsel for the DandO
Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are received and (ii)
Parent, the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and each DandO Indemnified
Party will use all reasonable efforts to assist in the vigorous defense of
any such matter; provided, that none of the Surviving Corporation, any of its
Subsidiaries or Parent shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent. Any DandO Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 5.14 shall notify Parent upon learning of
any such Action, investigation or arbitration (but the failure so to notify
shall not relieve a party from any liability which it may have under this
Section 5.14, except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such
party).  The parties hereto agree that all rights to indemnification
hereunder, including provisions relating to advances of expenses incurred in
defense of any such Action existing in favor of the DandO Indemnified Parties
with respect to matters occurring through the Closing Date, shall continue in
full force and effect for a period of six years from the Closing Date;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of
any DandO Indemnified Liabilities asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such DandO Indemnified Liabilities.

  

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for an aggregate
period of not less than six years from the Effective Time, the Companys
current directors and officers an insurance and indemnification policy that
provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D
andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing policy
or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best
available coverage; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation
shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in
excess of 200 percent of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of
this Agreement.

  

Section 5.15 _Acknowledgement of Limitation of Warranties_. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge that they have conducted to their satisfaction an independent
investigation of the financial condition, results of operations, assets,
liabilities, properties, and prospects of the Company and, in making the
determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, have relied solely on the results of their own independent
investigation and the representations and warranties set forth in this
Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), the certificates
contemplated by this Agreement and the covenants, agreements and other
obligations of the Company contained in this Agreement. Such representations
and warranties in the Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive
representations

        

and warranties of the Company to Parent and Merger Sub in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby, and Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge
and agree that the Company is not making any representation or warranty
whatsoever, express or implied, beyond those expressly given in this
Agreement (as qualified by the Company Disclosure Schedule), including any
implied warranty as to condition, merchantability, or suitability as to any
of the assets or properties of the Company. Parent and Merger Sub further
acknowledge and agree that, except for an Action based on the representations
and warranties expressly contained in this Agreement, neither the Company nor
any other Person will have or be subject to any liability or indemnification
obligation to Parent or any other Person, based on any other representations
and warranties not contained in Article III or resulting from the
distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent or Merger Subs use of, any
information, projections, documents or material made available to Parent or
Merger Sub at any time in certain "data rooms," management presentations,
"break-out" discussions, responses to questions submitted by or on behalf of
Parent or Merger Sub, whether orally or in writing, or in any other form in
expectation or furtherance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  

Section 5.16 _Supplemental Disclosure_. The Company may, subject to the
provisions of this Section 5.16, from time to time, but no later than three
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, by notice in accordance with this
Agreement, supplement the Company Disclosure Schedule to reflect any matter
that (i) arises or new information that becomes known by the Company after
the date of this Agreement and (ii) would have been required or permitted to
be set forth or described in the Company Disclosure Schedule had such
matter existed or such information been known to the Company as of the date
of this Agreement. The Companys representations and warranties in Article
III of this Agreement shall be deemed to include such supplemental disclosure
as of the date of this Agreement and thereafter, including the Closing Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any matters reflected in one or more of any
such supplemental disclosures may be considered for purposes of determining
whether the condition contained in Section 6.2(e) has been satisfied.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, no information included in any supplemental disclosure as to which
the Company had Knowledge as of the date of this Agreement or that seeks to
correct any error or omission to the Company Disclosure Schedule relating to
the period on or prior to the date of this Agreement shall be considered to
have been disclosed for purposes of determining whether Parent may seek
indemnification under Section 7.2(a) and the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed to include or reflect any such supplemental disclosure.

  

Section 5.17 _Change of Control Payment_. Parent agrees that it will, or
will cause the Company to, discharge the obligations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries with respect to the Change of Control Payment required
pursuant to the 12¼% Notes Indenture and the 11⅞% Notes Indenture.

  

Section 5.18 _Company Stockholder Approval_. No later than 5:00 pm. (Eastern
time) on September 14, 2007, unless the Voting Agreement is terminated
pursuant to the terms thereof, the Company shall obtain an executed action by
written consent constituting the Company Stockholder Approval and shall
provide a copy of such written consent to Parent.

  

Section 5.19 _Retention Bonuses_. The Company shall be permitted to pay
retention bonuses to certain non-executive employees of the Company pursuant
to a retention

        

bonus program to be developed by the Company prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Retention Bonus Program_ "), which shall provide for fifty percent of each
bonus award thereunder to be paid immediately prior to the Closing to award
recipients employed by the Company at such time and fifty percent of each
bonus award to be paid on the six month anniversary of the Closing Date to
award recipients who remain employed by the Company at such time. The
aggregate amount of retention bonuses under the Retention Bonus Program shall
not exceed $400,000. The Company shall consider the input of Parent into the
design and terms of the Retention Bonus Program, in light of the Retention
Bonus Programs purposes, it being understood and agreed that Parents right
to provide input shall not constitute a right to approve the final terms of
the Retention Bonus Program as decided by the Company.

 **ARTICLE VII**

  

 ** _SURVIVAL AND INDEMNIFICATION_**

  

Section 7.1 _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_. The
representations and warranties of the parties contained in this Agreement
shall survive the Closing until March 31, 2009; _provided_ , _however_ , that
notwithstanding the foregoing, the representations and warranties of the
Company set forth in Section 3.16 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing until
March 31, 2010.  All covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement
which are to have effect or be performed prior to the Closing shall survive
the Closing until March 31, 2009 and all covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement which are to have effect or be performed after the Closing
shall survive the Closing in accordance with their terms; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that notwithstanding the foregoing, the covenants set forth in
Section 5.1(l) and Article VIII shall survive the Closing until March 31,
2010. Any right of indemnification pursuant to this Article VII with respect
to a claimed breach of a representation, warranty or covenant shall expire at
the date of termination of the survival period for such representation,
warranty or covenant claimed to be breached (the " _Termination Date_ "),
unless on or prior to the Termination Date a written claim for
indemnification has been made to the Stockholders Representative or Parent,
as the case may be. Provided that an indemnification claim is timely made,
it may continue to be asserted beyond the Termination Date of the
representation and warranty to which such claim relates until the final
disposition of such claim.

  

Section 7.2 _Indemnification of Parent Indemnified Parties_.

  

(a) From and after the Closing, Parent and its Affiliates (including the
Surviving Corporation) and their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents and representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively,
the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ "), as the case may be, shall be
indemnified, protected, defended and held harmless from and against all
liabilities, demands, claims, actions or causes of action, assessments,
losses, damages, Taxes, costs and expenses (including interest, penalties and
attorneys fees, disbursements and expenses)

        

(collectively, " _Damages_ ") asserted against, resulting to, imposed upon or
incurred by any Parent Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly (whether in
respect of Third Party Claims (as defined in Section 7.4 below) or claims
between the parties hereto), arising out of or relating to any of the
following: (i) a breach of any representation or warranty of the Company set
forth in this Agreement (other than representations in Section 3.16 relating
to Taxes which are addressed under clause (iii) of this Section 7.2(a)) or in
any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) a breach of any
covenant, agreement or other obligation of the Company contained in this
Agreement (other than covenants with respect to Taxes which are addressed
under clause (iii) of this Section 7.2(a)), (iii) (A) Taxes of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries with respect to any Pre-Closing Period (as
defined in Section 8.1 below) (including Taxes imposed by U.S. Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any comparable provision of state, local or
foreign law as a result of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries being
included in an affiliated group that files consolidated or combined returns),
(B) with respect to any Straddle Period (as defined in Section 8.1 below),
Taxes imposed on or required to be withheld by the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries which are allocable to the portion of such taxable year
or period ending on the Closing Date, and (C) any Damages resulting from or
attributable to a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
contained in Section 3.16, Section 5.1(l) or Article VIII, (iv) matters set
forth in Section 7.2 of the Company Disclosure Schedule and (v) claims
brought by any holder of Company equity securities or Stock Options
in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including claims, if any, with respect to appraisal rights
under Section 262 of the DGCL); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event will the
aggregate indemnification obligation under this Section 7.2 exceed the
Contingent Consideration and, with respect to claims for indemnification made
by a Parent Indemnified Party under Section 7.2(a)(iii) after March 31, 2009,
the aggregate indemnification obligation under this Section 7.2 shall not
exceed the Escrow Amount; and _provided_ , _further_ that (A) no claims
for indemnification may be made by a Parent Indemnified Party under
Section 7.2(a)(i) and (iv) unless and until the aggregate amount of such
Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnity
under the terms hereof exceeds $1,500,000 (the " _Indemnity Basket_ ") and
(B) no claims for indemnification may be made by a Parent Indemnified Party
under Section 7.2(a)(iii) unless and until the aggregate amount of such
Damages for which the Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnity
under the terms hereof exceeds $400,000 (the " _Tax Basket_ "). In the event
the aggregate amount of the Damages sustained by the Parent Indemnified
Parties under Section 7.2(a)(i) and (iv) exceeds the Indemnity Basket, the
indemnification obligations hereunder shall apply only to those Damages
sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties in excess of the Indemnity
Basket. In the event the aggregate amount of the Damages sustained by the
Parent Indemnified Parties under Section 7.2(a)(iii) exceeds the Tax Basket,
the indemnification obligations hereunder shall apply only to those Damages
sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties in excess of the Tax Basket.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnity Basket shall not apply to
Damages resulting from breaches by the Company with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.2 and Section 3.5 of
this Agreement, for all of which Damages the Parent Indemnified Parties shall
be indemnified hereunder whether or not the Basket has been exceeded. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Indemnity Basket shall not apply to Damages for which
Parent Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under Section
7.2(a)(ii), (iii) (subject to the Tax Basket), or (v).

        

(b) If during any period prior to March 31, 2010, Parent determines, acting
in good faith, that applicable Law requires the Company to take a position on
a Tax Return that is not consistent with any of the representations and
warranties in Section 3.16(o), (p), (q) or (r) (the " _NOL Reps_ "), Parent
may, at its own expense, have the Tax Arbitrator (as defined below) determine
whether a breach of the NOL Reps has occurred, and if so, the extent of such
breach.  If the Tax Arbitrator determines that a breach of the NOL Reps
has occurred, the Company shall be considered to have breached an NOL Rep
for purposes of Section 7.2(a) and the Damages from such breach shall be the
amount determined by the Tax Arbitrator, subject to Section 7.2(c). As used
in this Agreement, " _Tax Arbitrator_ " shall mean a Tax lawyer at a
nationally recognized accounting firm or law firm appointed by mutual
agreement of Parent and the Stockholders Representative. Any presentation to
the Tax Arbitrator shall be made by both the Company and the
Stockholders Representative, acting reasonably, on mutually agreed terms.

  

(c) For purposes of Section 7.2(a) and notwithstanding Section 7.2(b), the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to any indemnification for
breach of the representations and warranties in the NOL Reps unless, and
solely to the extent that, (i) prior to March 31, 2010 the Surviving
Corporation consummates one or more asset dispositions other than in the
ordinary course of business (the "Divestiture Transactions"), (ii) such
Divestiture Transactions generate taxable gain or income to the Surviving
Corporation (not taking into account, for purposes of such calculation,
deductions or losses generated by the Surviving Corporation from and after
the Closing) and (iii) the net operating losses related to the NOL Reps would
have been utilized by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates during tax
periods (or portions thereof) prior to March 31, 2010, in connection with
such Divestiture Transactions (not taking into account, for purposes of such
calculation, deductions and losses generated by the Surviving Corporation
from and after the Closing).  The indemnifiable amount shall be determined by
the Tax Arbitrator and shall be (i) the actual tax liability incurred by the
Parent Indemnified Parties as a result of the breach plus (ii) to the extent
any such income or gain (or portion thereof) incurred after the Closing Date,
after reduction by the amount of the actual NOL available as determined by
the Tax Arbitrator, is actually offset by any losses or deductions incurred
after the Closing Date, the present value of the Tax savings that would have
been utilized with respect to such deductions or losses incurred after the
Closing Date if there had not been a breach of the NOL Reps (such amount
discounted from the taxable period in which it is reasonably anticipated that
the Surviving Company will have sufficient net income to fully utilize such
deductions or losses, as determined by the Tax Arbitrator after presentations
by Parent and the Stockholders Representative).

  

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, the sole source of indemnification of the
Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Agreement shall be the Contingent
Consideration, if any (and subject to the other limitations set forth
herein), and no Parent Indemnified Party shall have a direct right of
indemnification against any Seller Indemnified Party hereunder.

  

Section 7.3 _Indemnification of Seller Indemnified Parties_. From and after
the Closing, the former stockholders of the Company (in proportion to their
percentage interest in the Merger Consideration) and their respective
Affiliates and their respective directors, officers, employees, agents and
representatives and their successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Seller
Indemnified Parties_ "), as the case may be, shall be indemnified, protected,
defended and held harmless by Parent from and against all Damages asserted
against, resulting to, imposed upon or

        

incurred by any Seller Indemnified Party, directly or indirectly (whether in
respect of Third Party Claims or claims between the parties hereto), arising
out of or relating to any of the following:  (i) a breach of any
representation or warranty of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement and (ii)
a breach of any covenant, agreement or other obligation of Parent and Merger
Sub contained in this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
will the aggregate indemnification obligation under this Section 7.3 exceed
the lesser of (x) the amount of the Contingent Consideration and (y)
$10,000,000, except that, with respect to any breach of Parents obligation
to pay the Contingent Cash Amount pursuant to Article II and
Parents covenants in Section 2.2(h) regarding the operation of the
Surviving Corporation during the Earn-Out Period, in no event will the
aggregate indemnification obligation exceed (x) $35,000,000 minus (y) the
sum of (A) any amounts paid to or on behalf of Parent Indemnified Parties
in connection with undisputed and/or resolved claims for indemnification
pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement, (B) Parents good faith estimate
of the dollar amount of any unresolved claims for indemnification actually
made by Parent Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article VII of this Agreement
and (C) the Contingent Cash Amount previously paid by Parent; and _provided_
,  _further_ that no claims for indemnification may be made by a
Seller Indemnified Party under Section 7.3(i) unless and until the
aggregate amount of such Damages for which the Seller Indemnified Parties are
entitled to indemnity under the terms hereof exceeds $400,000 (the " _Parent
Basket_ "). In the event the aggregate amount of the Damages sustained by the
Seller Indemnified Parties under Section 7.3(i) exceeds the Parent Basket,
the indemnification obligations hereunder shall apply only to those Damages
sustained by the Seller Indemnified Parties in excess of the Parent Basket.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Basket shall not apply to Damages
resulting from breaches by Parent and Merger Sub with respect to
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.2 of this
Agreement, for all of which Damages the Seller Indemnified Parties shall be
indemnified hereunder whether or not the Parent Basket has been exceeded. For
the avoidance of doubt, the Parent Basket shall not apply to Damages for
which Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under
Section 7.3(ii).

  

Section 7.4 _Third Party Claims_. Promptly upon the receipt by a Parent
Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified Party, as applicable (the "
_Indemnified Party_ "), of any notice of the commencement of any action or
Tax Proceeding brought by a Person not a party hereto (a " _Third Party
Claim_ "), such Parent Indemnified Party shall give notice of such Third
Party Claim to the Stockholders Representative (and, if after March 31,
2009, to the Escrow Agent), and such Seller Indemnified Party shall give
notice of such Third Party Claim to Parent, as applicable (such party
receiving such notice, the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), but the failure to give
such notice shall not relieve the indemnification obligation under this
Article VII, except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced thereby. If an Indemnified Party gives such notice, the
Indemnifying Party, upon giving notice to such Indemnified Party, will
be entitled to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party at the Indemnifying
Partys sole cost and expense and the Indemnifying Party will be entitled to
prosecute, appeal, negotiate, resolve, settle, compromise, arbitrate or
otherwise pursue such Third Party Claim, in whole or in part, subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If the Indemnifying
Party exercises its rights to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have no obligation to indemnify or pay for or
reimburse any Indemnified Party for any attorneys fees or

        

expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party after the assumption of the
defense of such Third Party Claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
reasonable fees and expenses of one counsel to the Indemnified Party will be
indemnifiable hereunder if, in the reasonable view of counsel to the
Indemnified Party, (i) a conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying
Party and any Indemnified Party or (ii) there may be legal defenses available
to the Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those
available to the Indemnifying Party. The Parent Indemnified Party shall be
permitted to participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim relating to
Taxes. The Indemnifying Party agrees that it will not, without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened Third Party Claim
relating to matters contemplated hereby if any Indemnified Party is a party
thereto or has been threatened to be made a party thereto unless such
settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each
such Indemnified Party from all Liability arising or that may arise out of
such Third Party Claim and provides solely for monetary relief satisfied or
to be satisfied by the Indemnifying Party. If the Indemnifying Party does not
exercise such right to assume the defense within ten days of its receipt of
notice of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may assume the defense
thereof by counsel of the Indemnified Partys choosing and if the Indemnified
Party is determined to be entitled to indemnification with respect to such
Third Party Claim the Indemnified Party will be permitted, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article VII, to recover all Damages incurred or
sustained as a result of such Third Party Claim.  Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Third Party Claim relating to Taxes may be settled, compromised
or otherwise resolved without the consent of the Surviving Corporation to the
extent that such settlement, compromise or other resolution would adversely
affect the Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation.
There will be no indemnification liability for any Damages in connection with
any settlement of any Third Party Claim by the Indemnified Party without the
Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

  

Section 7.5 _Other Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a) In the event any Indemnified Party should have an indemnification claim
under this Article VII that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall deliver notice of such claim (a " _Pending Claim_ ")
to the Indemnifying Party promptly following the Indemnified Party becoming
aware of the same. The failure by any Indemnified Party to so notify the
Indemnifying Party shall not relieve the indemnification obligation under
this Article VII, except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party has been
actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

  

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 calendar days after delivery to the
Indemnifying Party of a notice of a Pending Claim (the " _Pending Claim
Review Period_ ") in which to notify the Indemnified Party in writing (the "
_Pending Claim Objection Notice_ ") of any good faith disagreement regarding
the right to indemnification thereof, setting forth in reasonable detail the
Indemnifying Partys objections. If the Indemnifying Party does not deliver
a Pending Claim Objection Notice within the Pending Claim Review Period,
the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to agree in all respects with the
claim for indemnification.

  

(c) If a Pending Claim Objection Notice is properly and timely delivered,
Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall use good faith efforts to
resolve their

        

differences with respect to the Pending Claim within 30 calendar days after
the Indemnifying Partys receipt of the Pending Claim Objection Notice. Any
differences with respect to the Pending Claim not resolved by Parent and the
Stockholders Representative within such 30-day period shall be resolved by
litigation in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or any court of
the United States located in the State of Delaware.

  

Section 7.6 _Punitive Damages_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, in no event shall an Indemnified Party be indemnified for
punitive, exemplary, special or consequential damages, regardless of the form
of action through which such damages are sought, unless such damages are
recovered by a third party in a Third Party Claim.

  

Section 7.7 _No Duplications_. Any liability for indemnification
hereunder shall be determined without duplication of recovery by reason of
the state of facts giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of
more than one representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

  

Section 7.8 _Tax Benefits_. All indemnity payments hereunder shall be net of
all Tax benefits actually realized (through a reduction in current
Tax liability) prior to March 31, 2010 by the Indemnified Party with respect
to the events that cause such payments to become due. To the extent that the
receipt of an indemnity payment hereunder causes the Indemnified Party to
realize taxable income, the indemnity payment by the Indemnifying Party shall
be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the Indemnified Party the
amount payable to the Indemnified Party under the preceding sentence (after
taking into account the Indemnified Partys current or future Tax cost from
the receipt of such payment).

  

Section 7.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. From and after the Effective Time, the
rights and remedies under this Article VII shall be exclusive and in lieu of
any and all other rights and remedies that the Indemnified Parties may have
for monetary relief with respect to breaches of representatives,
warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that such limitation on the rights and remedies of any
Indemnified Party shall not limit any recourse or remedy that may be
available to them at law or in equity against any party for intentional
fraud.

  

 **ARTICLE VIII**

  

 ** _TAX MATTERS_**

  

Section 8.1 _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns and Payment of Taxes_.

  

(a) Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be
filed all Tax Returns for the Company and the Company Subsidiaries for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Period_
") that are due after the Closing Date and for any taxable period beginning
on or before and ending after the Closing Date (" _Straddle Period_ ").  An
amount equal to the Taxes shown as due and payable on such Tax Return to the
extent such Taxes are due with respect to the Tax liability of the Company
for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and the portion of
any Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be deducted when
calculating the Contingent Cash Amount.  In the case of any Straddle Period,
(i) Taxes that are not based on income or receipts ( _e.g._ , property
taxes) shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-
Closing Period (as defined in this Section 8.2) on a

        

daily pro-rata basis, and (ii) all Taxes other than Taxes described in
Section 8.1(i) shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Period and the
Post-Closing Period on a closing of the books basis as if such taxable period
ended as of the close of business on the Closing Date. " _Post-
Closing Period_ " means any taxable period beginning after the Closing Date.

  

(b) Any material Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or for a Straddle Period
shall be submitted to the Stockholders Representative (including supporting
documentation) at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the due date (including
extensions) of such Tax Return. If the Stockholders Representative objects
to any item on any such Tax Return, it shall, within ten (10) days after
delivery of such Tax Return, notify Parent in writing that it so objects. If
a notice of objection shall be duly delivered, Parent and the Stockholders
Representative shall negotiate in good faith and use their best efforts to
resolve such items. If Parent and the Stockholders Representative are
unable to reach such agreement within five (5) days after receipt by
Parent of such notice, the disputed items shall be resolved by a final
determination of the Accountants; _provided_ , _howeve_ r, that if the
dispute is not resolved by the due date of such Tax Return (taking into
account any extension of time within which to file), Parent shall file the
Tax Return, as originally prepared by Parent, to the relevant Tax Authority
and if necessary, an amended return shall be filed after the final
determination of the Accountants.

  

Section 8.2 _Cooperation_. Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall
cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the
other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
examination, litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such
cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request)
the provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any
such audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on
a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation
of any material provided hereunder.

  

Section 8.3 _Purchaser Tax Covenants_.

  

(a) Parent shall not (and shall not cause or permit the Company or any
Company Subsidiary), to make or change any material Tax election, amend any
Tax Return, agree to the waiver or extension of the statute of limitations
relating to any Tax of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, take any Tax
position on any Tax Return, or compromise or settle any Tax liability, in
each case if such action could have the effect of materially increasing the
Tax liability or materially decreasing any Tax asset of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of any Pre-Closing Period without the prior
consent of Stockholders Representative, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld. If Parent breaches the foregoing covenant, the
Stockholders shall not be liable for any Taxes that are a direct or indirect
result of such breach.

  

(b) Parent shall promptly pay Stockholders Representative all refunds of
Taxes and interest thereon received by, or credited against the Tax liability
of Parent, any Affiliate of Parent or the Company or any Company Subsidiary
attributable to Taxes actually paid or borne by any Stockholder, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Company with respect to any
Pre-Closing Period; _provided_ , _however_ , that any erroneous refund shall
be promptly repaid to Parent. For the avoidance of doubt, a refund of
Taxes for which Parent is entitled to indemnification under Article VII shall
not be attributable to Taxes paid by

        

any Stockholder, the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to
any Pre-Closing Period to the extent that such Taxes do not exceed the Tax
Basket or to the extent that such refunds were for Taxes that were in excess
of the Contingent Consideration or the Escrow Amount, and for the avoidance
of doubt, to the extent that such refunds of Taxes were for amounts subject
to the Tax Basket, for purposes of computing the aggregate amount of Damages
sustained by the Parent Indemnified Parties in the Tax Basket, the Damages
shall be correspondingly reduced for such Tax refund amounts.

  

Section 8.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. Unless otherwise required by Law, the
Parties agree to treat any indemnity payments made under this Agreement as
an adjustment to the purchase price for all Tax purposes.

  

 **ARTICLE IX**

  

 ** _TERMINATION_**

  

Section 9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time as follows:

  

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Parent;

  

(b) by the Company or Parent, if the Merger shall not have been consummated

of the approvals of the Governmental Authorities listed in Section 6.1 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule shall not have been obtained and (ii) all other
conditions to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are satisfied or then capable of being satisfied, then either

_provided_ , _further_ , that the right to terminate this Agreement under
this Section 9.1(b) and the right to elect to extend such date shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Merger to
be consummated by such date;

  

(c) by the Company or Parent, if any Governmental Authority of competent
jurisdiction shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken other
action restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such
order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and
nonappealable;

  

(d) by Parent, if there shall have been a breach in any material respect of
any of the covenants or agreements on the part of the Company set forth in
this Agreement or a breach of any of the representations and warranties of
the Company that would cause the conditions precedent set forth in Section
6.2(a) not to be satisfied, in each case which has not been cured within 30
days after receipt of written notice of such breach;

  

(e) by the Company, if there shall have been a breach in any material respect
of any of the covenants or agreements on the part of Parent or Merger Sub set
forth in this Agreement or a breach of any of the representations and
warranties of Parent and Merger Sub that would cause the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 6.3(a) not to be satisfied, in each case which has not
been cured within 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach;

  

(f) By Parent, if the Company Stockholder Approval has not been obtained by
5:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on September 14, 2007;

   

54  

   

(g) By Parent, if the Company shall have materially breached any of the
provisions of Section 5.2 and such breach has not been cured within 48 hours
after receipt of written notice of such breach; and

  

(h) By the Company, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholder
Approval, to accept and enter into a binding agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal; _provided_ that (i) at least five days prior to
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(h) the Company has
provided Parent with written notice advising Parent that the board of
directors of the Company has received a Superior Proposal that it intends to
accept, specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior
Proposal and identifying the Person making such Superior Proposal and (ii)
the Company shall, and shall have caused its financial and legal advisors to,
negotiate in good faith with Parent during such five day period to
make adjustments in the terms of a revised Agreement between the Company and
Parent that are equal or superior to the terms of such Superior Proposal;
_provided_ ,  _further_ , that simultaneously with any termination of this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(h), the Company shall pay to Parent
the Termination Fee (as defined in Section 9.2  below); and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
this Section 9.1(h) if it has materially breached any of the provisions of
Section 5.2.

  

Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_.

  

(a) In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1,
this Agreement (other than Section 5.4(c), Section 5.13, this Section 9.2 and
Article X) shall become void and of no effect with no liability on the part
of any party hereto (or any of its Affiliates or representatives); _provided_
, _however_ , that no such termination shall relieve any party hereto from
any Liability for damages resulting from fraud or any willful and intentional
breach of this Agreement.

  

(b) In the event that (i) (x) after the date of this Agreement, a Takeover
Proposal shall have been made to the Company, (y) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.1(g), and (z) within nine months
after such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement to
consummate a Takeover Proposal or consummates a Takeover Proposal (solely for
purposes of this Section 9.2(b) (i) (z), the term Takeover Proposal shall
have the meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained
in Section 5.2(c) except that all references to "15%" shall be deemed
references to "50%"); (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.1(f); or (iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to Section 9.1(h), then the Company shall pay Parent a fee equal to
$10,000,000 ( the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same-day funds
on the date of termination of this Agreement (except that in the case of
termination described in clause (i) above, the Company shall pay Parent the
Termination Fee on the date of consummation of such transaction).

  

(c) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in Section 9.2(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement;
accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to
Section 9.2(b) and, to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which
results in a judgment against the Company for the amount due pursuant to
Section 9.2(b), the Company shall pay Parent its out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit.

        

 **ARTICLE X _ 
  
 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS_**

  

Section 10.1 _Stockholders  Representative_.

  

(a) In the event the Merger is approved, effective upon such vote, and
without any further action by the Company or any of the Companys
stockholders (the " _Stockholders_ "), the Company hereby appoints JPMP as
the Stockholders Representative (the " _Stockholders  Representative_") for
each of the Stockholders (except such Stockholders, if any, who do not vote
in favor of the Merger), as each of such Stockholders agent, to act in each
of such Stockholders name, place and stead, as such Stockholders attorney-
in-fact, to execute and deliver all documents necessary or desirable to carry
out the intent of this Agreement and any other documents and agreements
contemplated by this Agreement with respect to such Stockholders (including
any amendments or waivers of this Agreement and such other documents and
agreements), to make all elections or decisions contemplated by
this Agreement and any other agreements contemplated by this Agreement
including, the initiation or defense of claims for indemnification or other
litigation or proceedings, to give and receive on behalf of such Stockholders
any and all notices from or to any such Stockholder or Stockholders hereunder
and to engage such third parties and obtain such insurance and other similar
coverage on behalf of such Stockholders (including the execution of
agreements on behalf of the Stockholders in connection therewith) as the
Stockholders Representative determines to be appropriate and in the best
interests of such Stockholders, and does hereby give and grant unto the
Stockholders Representative the power and authority to do and perform each
such act and thing whatsoever, that such Stockholders may or are required to
do pursuant to this Agreement and all other documents and agreements executed
and delivered by such Stockholders in connection with this Agreement, and to
amend, modify or supplement any of the foregoing in each such Stockholders
name, place and stead, as if such Stockholder had personally done such act,
and JPMP as Stockholders Representative hereby accepts such appointment.
 Any proceeds received by the Stockholders Representative from Parent
or the Surviving Corporation on behalf of such Stockholders shall be turned
over to such Stockholders as promptly as practicable by the
Stockholders Representative, in accordance with the terms and provisions of
this Agreement. The death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation, insolvency
or bankruptcy of any such Stockholder shall not terminate such appointment or
the authority and agency of the Stockholders Representative. The power-of-
attorney granted in this Section 10.1 is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable. Parent and the Surviving Corporation may conclusively rely upon,
without independent verification or investigation, all decisions made by the
Stockholders Representative on behalf of the Stockholders that approve the
Merger in connection with this Agreement.

  

(b) The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted under this Agreement in its capacity as Stockholders Representative.
 The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to rely, and shall
be fully protected in relying, upon any statements furnished to it by any
person or any other evidence deemed by the Stockholders Representative to
be reliable, and the Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to act on
the advice of counsel selected by it. The Stockholders Representative shall
be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this
Agreement or any related document or agreement unless it shall have received
such advice or concurrence of such Stockholders as it deems

        

appropriate or it shall have been expressly indemnified to its satisfaction
by the Stockholders appointing it, severally according to their respective
ownership percentages, against any and all liability and expense that the
Stockholders Representative may incur by reason of taking or continuing to
take any such action.

  

(c) The Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to retain counsel and
to incur such expenses as the Stockholders Representative deems to be
necessary or appropriate in connection with its performance of its
obligations under this Agreement (including engaging an affiliated or third
party trust or escrow service to assist in the administrative tasks required
to be performed by the Stockholders Representative hereunder), and all such
fees and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses and
reasonable fees and expenses of any trust or escrow service) incurred by the
Stockholders Representative shall be borne by such Stockholders pro rata
according to their respective ownership percentages.

  

(d) By approving this Agreement, the Stockholders hereby agree to indemnify
the Stockholders Representative (in its capacity as such) and its agents and
other representatives ratably according to their respective ownership
percentages, and to hold the Stockholders Representative (in its capacity as
such) and its agents and other representatives harmless from, any and all
Losses of whatever kind which may at any time be imposed upon, incurred by or
asserted against the Stockholders Representative and its agents and other
representatives in such capacity in any way relating to or arising out of its
action or failures to take action pursuant to this Agreement or any related
document or agreement or in connection herewith or therewith in such
capacity. The agreements in this Section 10.1 shall survive termination of
this Agreement.

  

(e) JPMP shall be the initial Stockholders Representative and shall serve as
the Stockholders Representative until its resignation. Upon the resignation
of JPMP, Stockholders representing a majority of the aggregate ownership
percentages of all Stockholders, shall select a new Stockholders
Representative. Each time a new Stockholders Representative is appointed
pursuant to this Agreement, such Person, as a condition precedent to the
effectiveness of such appointment, shall accept such position in writing.

  

Section 10.2 _Representations and Warranties_. JPMP, for purposes
of Section 5.11 and 5.12 and Article X and in its capacity as the
Stockholders Representative, hereby represents and warrants to Parent as of
the date of this Agreement and as of the Closing Date as follows:  (i) it is
a limited partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the laws of Delaware, (ii) it has all necessary power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each other agreement, document,
instrument, certificate or notice contemplated by this Agreement to be
executed by it in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby; (iii) the execution, delivery
and performance by it of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by its
Board of Directors or other governing body and no other proceedings on its
part are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby; and (iv) this Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by it and, assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery thereof by the other parties hereto, constitutes a
legally valid and binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in
accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors rights generally or by general equitable
principles.

        

Section 10.3 _Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement may not be amended, altered
or modified except by written instrument executed by Parent and the Company
prior to the Effective Time or executed by Parent and the
Stockholders Representative following the Effective Time.  Any waiver of
rights hereunder must be set forth in writing. The failure by any party hereto
to enforce at any time any of the provisions of this Agreement shall in no
way be construed to be a waiver of any such provision nor in any way to
affect the validity of this Agreement or any part hereof or the right of such
party thereafter to enforce each and every such provision.  No waiver of any
breach of or non-compliance with this Agreement shall be held to be a waiver
of any other or subsequent breach or non-compliance.

  

Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the
Company Disclosure Schedule and Exhibits), the Voting Agreement and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

  

Section 10.5 _Knowledge Convention_. Whenever any statement herein or in
any Schedule, Exhibit, certificate or other document delivered to any
party pursuant to this Agreement is made "to [its] knowledge" or words of
similar intent or effect (including without limitation "Knowledge") of any
party or its representative, the Person making such statement shall be
accountable only for those facts, circumstances or events, which as of the
date the representation is given, are actually known to the Person making
such statement, which with respect to the Company, means the persons
identified in Section 10.5 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and with
respect to Parent, means the knowledge of its executive officers.

  

Section 10.6 _Company Disclosure Schedule_. The inclusion of an item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item is
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The information
set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be organized to correspond
to the applicable sections and subsections of Article III, _provided_ that
any information set forth in one section of the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall be deemed to be disclosed in such other sections of the Company
Disclosure Schedule where the relevance of such information is reasonably
apparent, notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross-reference
thereto.

  

Section 10.7 _Interpretation_. In this Agreement, unless otherwise
expressly specified, the following rules of interpretation apply:

  

(a) references to Articles, Sections, Company Disclosure Schedules and

condition in this Agreement shall be given full, separate and independent
effect.

  

Section 10.8 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining
terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any
other jurisdiction. If any provision of this Agreement is so broad as to be
unenforceable, the provision shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is
