Article 1 

PURCHASE AND SALE OF THE BLOCKER INTERESTS; MERGER

1.1 Purchase and Sale of Blocker Interests. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, at the Closing and immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each Blocker Seller shall sell to Purchaser, and Purchaser
shall purchase from such Blocker Seller, all of such Blocker Seller's rights,
title and interests in and to the Blocker Interests, free and clear of all
Liens (other than any restrictions under the Securities Act or state
securities Laws or Liens solely created by or resulting from actions of
Purchaser) (the "Blocker Interest Acquisition"). The aggregate purchase price
for (a) the RCP Blocker Stock payable by Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to
Section 1.11(a) shall be the portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration
allocable to the RCP Blocker Stock in accordance with the Distribution
Waterfall (the "RCP Blocker Consideration"), and (b) the GA Blocker Interests
payable by Purchaser at the Closing pursuant to Section 1.11(b) shall be the
portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration allocable to the GA Blocker
Interests in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall (the "GA Blocker
Consideration"). Following the Effective Time, each Blocker Seller shall be
entitled to receive the applicable portion of the Additional Consideration,
if, as and when payable as set forth in this Agreement.

1.2 Merger. At the Effective Time and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and the applicable provisions of the DLLCA, Merger Sub shall merge with and
into the Company, the separate limited liability company existence of Merger
Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the Surviving Company (the
"Merger"); provided that the Parties shall be deemed to consummate the Blocker
Interest Acquisition immediately prior to the consummation of the Merger, but
neither the Blocker Interest Acquisition nor the Merger shall be consummated
unless both transactions are consummated.

1.3 The Closing and the Effective Time. The consummation of the Blocker
Interest Acquisition and the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Kirkland and Ellis LLP, 601 Lexington Avenue, New York, New York,
commencing at 10:00 a.m. on the third (3rd) Business Day following the
satisfaction or waiver of all conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than
the conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or at such other place or time or
on such other date as is mutually agreed in writing by Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative; provided that in no event shall the Closing occur
prior to June 26, 2018 (the "Inside Date"). The date of the Closing is
referred to herein as the "Closing Date." At the Closing, the Parties shall
file a certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "Certificate of
Merger") in substantially the form of Exhibit B, with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware as required by, and executed in accordance with, the
applicable provisions of the DLLCA (the time of such filing with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware, or such later time as may be agreed upon in
writing by Purchaser and the Company and specified in the Certificate of
Merger, shall be referred to herein as the "Effective Time").

1.4 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in the applicable provisions of the DLLCA. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the
Effective Time by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
Merger Sub or the Company, all of the property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Company,
and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall
become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

1.5 Organizational Documents of the Surviving Company. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub or
the Company, (a) the limited liability company agreement of the Surviving
Company shall be in substantially the form of Exhibit C (the "Surviving
Company Operating Agreement"), and (b) the certificate of formation of the
Surviving Company shall be the certificate of formation of the Company, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.6 Effect of the Merger on the Company Units and the Limited Liability
Company Interests of Merger Sub.

(a) Effect on the Company Units. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of any Party, each Company Unit
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Blocker Units) shall be converted automatically into the right to receive the
following, in each case, payable as set forth in this Agreement and without
interest:

(i) the portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration allocable to such
Company Unit (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall vary depending on the
designation and "Threshold Amount" (as such term is defined in the Company LLC
Agreement) of such Company Unit) in accordance with the Distribution
Waterfall; provided that the aggregate amount payable to each Unitholder under
this Section 1.6(a)(i) shall be as set forth in the Closing Certificate (as
may be revised pursuant to Section 1.10(b)); and

(ii) the portion of the Additional Consideration, if any, payable in respect
of such Company Unit, in each case, payable if, as and when set forth in this
Agreement;

provided that in no event shall the Blockers be entitled to receive any
portion of the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 1.6(a). All Company
Units (other than the Blocker Units), when converted pursuant to this Section
1.6(a), shall no longer be outstanding, and each former holder thereof shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the
amounts set forth in Section 1.6(a)(i) and Section 1.6(a)(ii) with respect to
any such Company Unit formerly held thereby.

(b) Limited Liability Company Interests of Merger Sub and the Blocker Units.
At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of any Party, (i) the limited liability company interests in Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into 1,857,431 Surviving Company Units in the aggregate, and (ii)
each Blocker Unit issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding and evidence one (1) Surviving Company Unit.
Each certificate evidencing ownership of any limited liability company
interests in Merger Sub, if any, shall automatically be deemed to evidence
ownership of such Surviving Company Units.

1.7 Mechanism of Payment.

(a) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall
enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent substantially in the form set
forth in Exhibit D (the "Paying Agent Agreement") providing for the payment of
the portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration payable pursuant to Section
1.6(a)(i) and any Additional Consideration payable to the Blocker Sellers and
the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units) under Section 1.12(c)
through Section 1.12(d) and Section 10.2(h)(ii).

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall deliver to each Unitholder (other than any holder of Blocker Units) a
Letter of Transmittal in the form of Exhibit E (a "Letter of Transmittal").
Upon delivery by a Unitholder (other than any holder of Blocker Units) to the
Paying Agent of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the instructions thereto (a "Completed LoT"), the Paying Agent
shall pay to such Unitholder, as promptly as reasonably practicable following
such delivery but in no event earlier than the Effective Time, cash in an
amount equal to the portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration payable to
such Unitholder in accordance with Section 1.6(a)(i), which amount shall be
paid by the Paying Agent by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the account designated by such Unitholder in such Unitholder's Letter of
Transmittal; provided that, to the extent any Unitholder (other than any
holder of Blocker Units) has delivered a Completed LoT to the Paying Agent no
later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Parties intend
that the Paying Agent shall, and shall instruct the Paying Agent to, make such
payment of the portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration payable to each
such Unitholder in accordance with Section 1.6(a)(i) on the Closing Date;
provided, however, that no Party shall have any Liability for any failure of
the Paying Agent to make any such payment on the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, (a) no Unitholder shall be entitled to receive any portion
of the amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) until such Unitholder has
delivered a Completed LoT to the Paying Agent and (b) no Unitholder shall be
entitled to receive any amount payable under Section 1.6(a)(ii) until any such
amount is otherwise payable in accordance with, and subject to specified
contingencies set forth in, this Agreement. No interest or dividends shall be
paid or accrued on the consideration payable to any Unitholder hereunder.
Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.7(b),
the Company Units shall represent, for all purposes, only the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the portion of the amounts payable in respect
thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(a), without any interest or dividends thereon. (c) None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, the RCP Parties, the GA Parties, the
Company, the Paying Agent or the Surviving Company shall be liable to any
Person in respect of any cash or property delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

(d) Any portion of the Payment Fund which remains undistributed to Unitholders
pursuant to Section 1.7(b) for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Purchaser or its designee upon demand, and Unitholders
shall thereafter look only to Purchaser as general creditor thereof for
payment of their claims for any amount under Section 1.6(a)(i).

(e) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as
directed by Purchaser in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement; provided
that no such investment shall relieve Purchaser or the Paying Agent from
making the payments required by this Section 1.7. Any interest or income
produced by such investments shall be payable to Purchaser or its designee as
directed by Purchaser.

1.8 No Further Ownership Rights in the Company Units. The rights into which
Company Units (other than Blocker Units) were converted pursuant to Section
1.6 shall be deemed to be full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such
Company Units, and, upon the Effective Time, there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Company of Company
Units which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

1.9 Payoff Letters. On or prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall obtain
payoff letters in customary form (each, a "Payoff Letter") with respect to all
outstanding Indebtedness of the Barteca Entities under the Contracts set forth
on Schedule 1.9 (the "Closing Repaid Indebtedness"), and each such Payoff
Letters shall (a) set forth the aggregate outstanding principal amount and all
accrued but unpaid interest, fees, premiums, penalties and other amounts owed
under such Closing Repaid Indebtedness as of the Closing Date, (b) contain
payment instructions and (c) evidence the termination of each such Contract,
and the satisfaction, release and discharge of all Indebtedness and other
Liabilities under each such Contract and the agreement by the lenders
thereunder and any other secured parties with respect thereto to release all
Liens securing and guarantees of such Closing Repaid Indebtedness, in each
case, upon the payment of such amounts in accordance with such payment
instructions.

1.10 Closing Certificate.

(a) No later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Company

setting forth:

Working Capital (the "Estimated Working Capital"), the total amount of

(ii) the Aggregate Closing Consideration; (iii) the amount payable to each Unitholder (other than any holder of Blocker

1.12(c) through Section 1.12(d) and Section 10.2(h)(ii), if, as and when
payable as set forth in this Agreement (each such pro rata portion, a "Pro
Rata Share"); provided that that sum of all Pro Rata Shares shall equal 100%;

(vii) the CEO Note Amount;

(viii) each payee, and the amount payable thereto, of the Estimated Sellers'
Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing Certificate, including (A)

Blocker Consideration and the Sellers' Representative Expense Fund.

(b) Following delivery of the Closing Certificate and prior to the Closing,

Representatives have with respect to the Closing Certificate, and the Company

such questions, comments or disagreements and (ii) consider any such
questions, comments and disagreements in good faith (and any such updates and
revisions as may be agreed to by the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser

Agreement); provided that (i) the Company shall have no obligation to update
the Closing Certificate and no disagreement with respect to the amounts set
forth in the Closing Certificate or the amount of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration shall delay the Closing and (ii) no questions, comments or
disagreements raised by Purchaser and not accepted by the Company for the
purposes of the Closing Certificate shall be deemed to be waived and may be

Sellers' Representative in connection with its review of the Closing
Statement; provided that (A) any access shall be conducted in such a manner as
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of Purchaser, the
Blockers or the Barteca Entities and (B) without the prior written consent of
Purchaser, none of the Sellers' Representative, the Blocker Sellers or the
Unitholders or any of their respective Representatives shall knowingly contact
any suppliers to, or other business relations (other than the Representatives
of Purchaser, the Barteca Entities and the Blockers, including their
accountants and auditors) of, Purchaser or any of its Affiliates (including
the Barteca Entities), in each case, in connection with the review of the
Closing Statement. If Purchaser does not receive a Dispute Notice within
forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Sellers' Representative of the
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement shall be conclusive and binding upon
each of the Parties. If Purchaser receives a Dispute Notice from the Sellers'
Representative within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the Sellers'
Representative of the Closing Statement, Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve each Item of Dispute, and, if any Item of Dispute is so resolved, the
Closing Statement shall be modified to the extent necessary to reflect such
resolution. If any Item of Dispute remains unresolved as of the thirtieth
(30th) day after delivery by the Sellers' Representative of the Dispute
Notice, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall jointly retain RSM US
LLP to resolve such remaining disagreement, it being understood that any item
not included as an Item of Dispute in the Dispute Notice shall be conclusive
and binding upon each of the Parties as set forth in the Closing Statement. If
RSM US LLP is unwilling or unable to serve as the Arbiter, the Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall jointly select and retain a nationally
recognized accounting firm that is not the auditor or independent accounting
firm of Purchaser, the Barteca Entities, the Blockers or any Blocker Seller to
serve as the Arbiter (RSM US LLP or such other accounting firm engaged in accordance with the terms and
conditions of this Section 1.12(b), the "Arbiter"). If, within fifteen (15)
days after any date the Arbiter informs the Sellers' Representative and
Purchaser that it is unable or unwilling to serve as the Arbiter, and the
Sellers' Representative and Purchaser cannot mutually agree on an alternate
Person to serve as the Arbiter, either the Sellers' Representative or
Purchaser may request the American Arbitration Association to appoint as the
Arbiter, within fifteen (15) days from the date of such request or as soon as
practicable thereafter, a partner in a nationally recognized accounting firm
that is not the auditor or independent accounting firm of any of Purchaser,
the Barteca Entities, the Blockers or any Blocker Seller, who is a certified
public accountant and who is independent of Purchaser, the Barteca Entities,
the Blockers and the Blocker Seller to serve as the Arbiter. Purchaser and the
Sellers' Representative shall request that the Arbiter render a determination
as to each unresolved Item of Dispute within thirty (30) days after its
retention, and Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall, and Purchaser
shall cause the Blockers and the Barteca Entities and each of their respective
Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with the Arbiter so as to enable it
to make such determination as quickly and accurately as reasonably
practicable, including by the provision by Purchaser, the Blockers and the
Barteca Entities of reasonable supporting information and documentation
relating to the Closing Statement or any Item of Dispute and all other items
reasonably requested by the Arbiter (in each case in such a manner so as not
to waive or eliminate any privilege applicable to any such information). The
Arbiter shall consider only those items and amounts that were set forth on the
Closing Statement and the Dispute Notice that remain unresolved by Purchaser
and the Sellers' Representative. In resolving any Item of Dispute, the Arbiter
may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest value for such
item claimed by either Party, or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either Party, on the Closing Statement or the Dispute Notice, as
applicable. The Arbiter's determination(s) shall be based upon the definitions
of Cash, Sellers' Transaction Expenses, Indebtedness and Working Capital (as
applicable) included herein, and shall not be an independent review. The
Arbiter's determination of each Item of Dispute submitted to it shall be in
writing, shall conform with this Section 1.12 and otherwise with terms of,
including the definition set forth in, this Agreement and shall be conclusive
and binding upon each of the Parties, and the Closing Statement shall be
modified to the extent necessary to reflect such determination(s). The Arbiter
shall allocate its fees, costs and expenses between Purchaser, on the one
hand, and the Sellers' Representative, on the other hand, based upon the
percentage which the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each such
Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party. The Cash, Sellers'
Transaction Expenses, total amount of Indebtedness outstanding as of the
Closing and Working Capital, in each case as finally determined pursuant to
this Section 1.12, are referred to herein as the "Actual Cash," "Actual
Sellers' Transaction Expenses," "Actual Indebtedness" and the "Actual Working
Capital," respectively.

(c) If the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration as finally determined
pursuant to Section 1.12(b) is greater than the Aggregate Closing
Consideration, then, within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration, (i) Purchaser shall pay an amount
equal to such excess to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the applicable account designated by the Paying Agent, and
(ii) Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent
to pay to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds,
the Adjustment Escrow Fund (the "Purchase Price Excess Amount"). As promptly
as reasonably practicable after receipt of the Purchase Price Excess Amount,
the Paying Agent shall disburse the Purchase Price Excess Amount to the
Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units) in accordance
with the Distribution Waterfall.

(d) If the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration is less than the Aggregate
Closing Consideration (such amount, the "Purchase Price Shortfall"), then,
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Aggregate
Adjusted Closing Consideration, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative
shall instruct the Escrow Agent to (i) pay to Purchaser, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Adjustment Escrow Fund to a bank account
designated in writing by Purchaser, an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the
Purchase Price Shortfall and (B) the then remaining balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund and (ii) following any payment pursuant to the foregoing clause
(i), pay to the Paying Agent the then remaining balance of the Adjustment
Escrow Fund, if any. As promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt of
any such remaining balance, the Paying Agent shall disburse such remaining
balance to the Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders (other than any holder of
Blocker Units) in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall. The Parties
agree that the Adjustment Escrow Fund shall serve as the sole and exclusive
source of recovery for any amounts owed to Purchaser in connection with the
final determination of the Aggregate Adjusted Closing Consideration pursuant
to this Agreement.

(e) The Parties agree that (i) this Section 1.12 is not intended to be used to
adjust for errors, omissions or adjustments that may be found with respect to
the Unaudited Financial Statements or any other balance sheet referenced in
Section 2.17(a) or any inconsistencies or adjustments between the Unaudited
Financial Statements or any other balance sheet referenced in Section 2.17(a)
and GAAP and (ii) any payments pursuant to this Section 1.12 shall be treated
as an adjustment to the applicable purchase price for Tax purposes to the
maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

1.13 Withholding. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement,
Purchaser, the Paying Agent and the Escrow Agent (and any of their respective
agents or Affiliates) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
payments made pursuant to this Agreement any Taxes required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payments under the Code or any
other applicable provision of applicable Law; provided, however, that in the
case of any Unitholder (other than any holder of Blocker Units) that fails to
timely deliver to the Paying Agent a certification of its non-foreign status
satisfying the requirements of Section 1446(f) of the Code in accordance with
the instructions included in the Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold the amount of any payment to be made
pursuant to this Agreement to such Unitholder as required under applicable Tax
Law; provided, further, that if Purchaser believes that any withholding of Tax
is required with respect to any payment to be made pursuant to this Agreement
(other than any withholding Tax obligation result from (a) any payments being
treated as compensation under applicable Tax law, (b) the failure to satisfy
the requirements of Section 1.11(i) or Section 1.11(j), or (c) the failure of
any Unitholder to provide an IRS Form W-9 establishing an exemption from
withholding under Section 1446(f) of the Code or backup withholding
obligations), then it shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give
written notice to the payee at least five (5) Business Days prior to making
such payment (or, if later, promptly after becoming aware thereof), and it
shall provide such payee a reasonable opportunity to provide any applicable
certificates, forms or documentation that would reduce or eliminate the
requirement to withhold Tax with respect to such payment under applicable Law.
To the extent that amounts are so withheld and deducted pursuant to this
Section 1.13, such withheld amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable
Tax Authority to the extent required by applicable Law and (ii) shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made.

1.14 Allocation of Amounts Paid By Purchaser or Merger Sub. Within ninety (90)
days following the final determination of the Closing Statement, Purchaser
shall provide the Sellers' Representative with an allocation of the Aggregate
Closing Consideration and the liabilities of the Barteca Entities (including
any other relevant items for Tax purposes) among the assets of the Barteca
Entities in accordance with the principles of Sections 743, 751, 755 and 1060
of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and in accordance with
the principles set forth in Schedule 1.14 (the "Purchase Price Allocation").
The Sellers' Representative shall have a period of ten (10) Business Days
following the receipt of such draft allocation to notify Purchaser in writing
of any objections to such draft allocation. If the Sellers' Representative
does not timely object to such draft allocation, such allocation shall become
final. If the Sellers' Representative timely raises any written objections,
Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative fail to
resolve any such dispute within ten (10) Business Days after the Sellers'
Representative delivers a written notice of objection, then the disputed items
shall be resolved by the Arbiter in accordance with the procedural principles
of Section 1.12(b) and this Section 1.14. Each of the Parties shall file all
Tax Returns (including amended returns and claims for refund) and information
reports in a manner consistent with the final Purchase Price Allocation, and
shall not take any position in any Tax Action that is inconsistent with the
final Purchase Price Allocation, in each case unless otherwise required by a
"determination" within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code (or any
analogous, comparable or similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
applicable Law).

1.15 CEO Note; Closing Payment Acknowledgment.

(a) At the Closing, (i) Jeff Carcara shall pay to the Company an amount of
cash equal to the CEO Note Amount in full satisfaction of the CEO Note and
(ii) the Company shall deliver to Purchaser evidence, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, of such full satisfaction.

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the aggregate amount payable by
Purchaser under Section 1.1 and Section 1.6(a)(i) is an amount equal to the
difference of (i) the Aggregate Closing Consideration, minus (ii) the CEO Note
Amount. For the avoidance of doubt, and without duplication of any amount
included in Cash pursuant to the definition thereof, the amount of Estimated
Cash included in the Aggregate Closing Consideration shall be increased by the
CEO Note Amount in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the amount
payable to Jeff Carcara under Section 1.6(a)(i) pursuant to the Distribution
Waterfall shall be calculated net of the CEO Note Amount.

of the Code) to the Barteca Entities, the Blockers, the Blocker Sellers or the
Unitholders on or before August 10, 1993.

representation or warranty with respect to the existence, amount, expiration
date or limitations on (or availability of) any Tax attribute (including net
operating losses) of such Blocker following the Closing.

4.9 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties expressly contained in this Article 4 (as

behalf and on behalf of their Representatives, that neither the such Blocker

projections, forecasts or other materials made available to Purchaser, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Representatives in the Dataroom or otherwise on

responsibility for making its own evaluation as to the accuracy and adequacy
of the materials so furnished to them or to their respective Representatives.
Without limiting the foregoing or any of Purchaser's or Merger Sub's rights or
remedies under this Agreement, neither such Blocker nor any other Person will
have or be subject to any liability whatsoever to Purchaser, Merger Sub or any
other Person, to the extent resulting from the distribution to Purchaser,
Merger Sub or any of their Representatives, or Purchaser's, Merger Sub's or
any of their Representatives use of or reliance on, any such information,
including any information, statements, disclosures, documents, projections,
forecasts or other materials made available to Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of
their Representatives in the Dataroom or otherwise in expectation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any discussions with respect to
any of the foregoing information.

ability of Purchaser or Merger to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.

5.4 Litigation. There are no Actions pending or, to Purchaser's Knowledge,

Blocker Interests and the Company Units solely for Purchaser's own account,
for investment purposes only, and not with a view to, or with any present
intention of, reselling or otherwise distributing the Blocker Interests or the
Company Units in violation of any federal or state securities Law. Purchaser
understands and acknowledges that (i) the Blocker Interests and the Company
Units have not been registered or qualified under the Securities Act, or under
any securities Laws of any state of the United States or any other
jurisdiction, and have been issued in reliance upon specific exemptions
thereunder, (ii) the Blocker Interests and the Company Units constitute
"restricted securities" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, (iii)
none of the Blocker Interests nor the Company Units is traded or tradable on
any securities exchange or over-the-counter and (iv) none of the Blocker
Interests nor the Company Units may be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed
of unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to
such Blocker Interests, as applicable, and qualification in accordance with
any applicable state securities Laws becomes effective or unless such
registration and qualification is inapplicable, or an exemption therefrom is
available. Purchaser shall not transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the
Blocker Interests or the Company Units acquired hereunder or any interest
therein in any manner that may cause the Blocker Sellers or any Unitholder to
be in violation of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities Laws.
Purchaser is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) of the
Securities Act.

5.6 Fees/Commissions. Except for Piper Jaffray and Co., no broker, finder or
investment banker retained by or authorized to act on behalf of either
Purchaser or Merger Sub is entitled to any brokerage or finder's fee,
commission or other fee or charge to any Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated under this Agreement or any other document
contemplated hereby to which either Purchaser or Merger Sub is a party.

5.7 Financing. Concurrently with the execution hereof, Purchaser has delivered
to the Company and the Sellers' Representative true, complete and correct, as
of the date hereof, copies of the executed commitment letter(s) and
corresponding customarily redacted fee letters (none of which redacted terms
affect the amount (other than as a result of the imposition of original issue
discount or upfront fees) or availability of the Debt Financing or impose any
conditions on the receipt of the Debt Financing) (including any annexes,
exhibits and schedules thereto, the "Debt Commitment Letters," as each may be
amended or replaced from time to time to the extent permitted by Section
6.8(a)) from the financial institutions identified therein (the "Lenders") to
provide, subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the
amounts set forth therein for the purpose of funding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (being collectively referred to as the "Debt
Financing"). Each of the Debt Commitment Letters is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser and, to the knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties
thereto. As of the date hereof, each of the Debt Commitment Letters is in full
force and effect, and none of the Debt Commitment Letters has been withdrawn,
rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended or modified in any respect, and
no such amendment or modification is contemplated by Purchaser and, to the
Knowledge of Purchaser, the other parties thereto. As of the date hereof,
Purchaser (a) is not in breach of any of the terms or conditions set forth in
any of the Debt Commitment Letters, and has no reason to believe that any
event has occurred that (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both)
would constitute a breach or default under any of the Debt Commitment Letters
and (b) assuming the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article 8 (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), has no reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letters to be satisfied by Purchaser shall not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters shall not be made available on the
Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no Debt Financing Source has notified
Purchaser of its intention to terminate all or any portion of the Debt
Commitment Letters or not to provide the Debt Financing. The aggregate net
cash proceeds from the Debt Financing, together with Purchaser's available
cash as of the Closing, shall be sufficient to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on a timely basis, including the payment of the
amounts to be paid by Purchaser under Article 1 and any other amounts required
to be paid in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Purchaser has paid or caused to be paid in
full any and all commitment or other fees required by the Debt Commitment
Letters that are due as of the date hereof. There are no conditions precedent
or contingencies to the obligations of the parties under the Debt Commitment
Letters (including pursuant to any "flex" provisions in the related fee letter
or otherwise) to make the full amount of the Debt Financing available to
Purchaser on the terms therein except as expressly set forth in the unredacted
portion of the Debt Commitment Letters. As of the date hereof, there are no
side letters or other agreements, Contracts or arrangements related to the
Debt Financing (other than the Debt Commitment Letters) that could reasonably
be expected to (i) prevent or substantially delay the availability of the full
amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters at
the Closing, (ii) reduce the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letters or (iii) affect the enforceability of the Debt
Commitment Letters. For the avoidance of doubt, it is not a condition to the
Closing under this Agreement for Purchaser to obtain the Debt Financing or any
Alternative Debt Financing.

5.8 Due Diligence Review. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that
(a) it has completed to its satisfaction its own due diligence review with
respect to the Blockers and the Barteca Entities and it is entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement based on such independent
investigation and analysis and, except for the representations and warranties
contained in Article 2, Article 3 and Article 4, it is not relying upon any
representation or warranty of any Barteca Entity, any RCP Party, any GA Party,
any Blocker, any Blocker Seller or any Affiliate thereof or any officer,
director, employee, agent or advisor, or any of them, nor upon the accuracy of
any record, projection or statement made available or given to Purchaser or
Merger Sub in the performance of such investigation, (b) it has had access to
its full satisfaction to the Barteca Entities and the Blockers and their
respective books and records, contracts, agreements and documents and (c) it
has had such opportunity to seek accounting, legal, Tax or other advice or
information in connection with its entry into this Agreement and the other
documents referred to herein relating to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby as it has seen fit.

5.9 Solvency. Assuming the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article
8 (other than those that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing),
after giving effect to all of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Debt Financing), each of the Blockers and the Barteca Entities
shall be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 5.9, "Solvent" means that, with
respect to any Person and as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of
the "present fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person, shall, as of
such date, exceed the amount of all "liabilities of such Person, contingent or
otherwise," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined in
accordance with applicable federal Laws governing determinations of the
insolvency of debtors, (b) the present fair saleable value of the assets of
such Person shall, as of such date, be greater than the amount that shall be
required to pay the liability of such Person on its indebtedness as its
indebtedness becomes absolute and matured, (c) such Person shall not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital with which to conduct
its business and (d) such Person shall be able to pay its indebtedness as it
matures. For purposes of the foregoing definition only, "indebtedness" means a
liability in connection with another Person's (i) right to payment, whether or
not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed,
contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured or unsecured or (ii) right to any equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a right of payment, whether or not
such right to an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent,
matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured. No transfer of
property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the intent to hinder,
delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Blockers or the
Barteca Entities.

5.10 No Additional Representations or Warranties. Except for the
representations and warranties contained in this Article 5 (it being
understood that the Blocker Sellers, the Blockers and the Company and each of
their Affiliates and advisors have relied only on such express representations
and warranties), the Blocker Sellers, the Blockers and the Company each
acknowledge and agree, on its own behalf and on behalf of each of their
Affiliates and advisors, that neither Purchaser or Merger Sub nor any other
Person on behalf of Purchaser or Merger Sub makes, and neither the Blocker
Sellers, the Blockers or the Company nor any of their Affiliates or advisors
has relied on, the accuracy or completeness of any express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to such Purchaser or Merger Sub or
with respect to any statement or information of any nature made or provided by
any Person or any information, statements, disclosures, documents,
projections, forecasts or other material made available to the Blocker
Sellers, the Blockers or the Company or their respective Representatives on
behalf of Purchaser or Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives..

(other than Consents of Governmental Authorities) that are required, pursuant
to the terms of any Contract set forth on Schedule 6.2, to be obtained prior

of the other Barteca Entities to permit), Purchaser and its Representatives
(including its Debt Financing Sources) to have access at all reasonable times
during normal business hours, and in a manner so as not to interfere with the
normal business operations of the Barteca Entities, to all premises,
properties, executive officers, books, records, contracts and documents (including Tax Returns and other books
and records with respect to Taxes) of the Barteca Entities and/or the
Blockers, as applicable; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not apply
with respect to any information the disclosure of which would, in the
Company's or the Blockers' reasonable discretion, as applicable, waive any

Person (provided that, if any such access is limited for the foregoing
reasons, the Blockers and the Company shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to establish a process that shall provide Purchaser with
timely access to the fullest extent possible to the substance of such
information). Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser is and remains bound by
the Confidentiality Agreement, between Purchaser and the Company dated March

Days after the date hereof), the Parties shall, make or cause to be made all
Filings required under any Laws for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby. Subject to applicable Laws, each Party shall give the

any other manner), any Person or portion thereof, or otherwise acquire or
agree to acquire any assets, if the entering into a definitive agreement
relating to, or the consummation of, such acquisition, merger or
consolidation, could reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the
obtaining of, or increase the risk of not obtaining, any Consent of any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) increase the risk of any Governmental Authority entering an Order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii)
increase the risk of not being able to remove any such order on appeal or
otherwise, or (iv) delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

(e) Each Party shall keep the other Parties reasonably apprised of the status

promptly furnishing the other Parties with copies of notices or other
communications received by such Party in connection therewith. No Party shall

Governmental Authority in respect of such filings and submissions unless, to
the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other Parties in
advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives
Representatives of the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat. Subject to this Section 6.6, Purchaser shall have the right to take
the lead in, and set the overall strategy for, resolving any Action with

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which efforts shall include
executing any required applications materials related to Liquor Licenses and,
without limiting any obligation of a Seller Indemnifying Person under Section
10.2(a)(iii), providing information necessary to resolve any Tax liability
related to Liquor Licenses; provided that the Barteca Entities shall not be
required to incur any liabilities, expend any amounts, institute any
litigation or other proceedings, provide any financial accommodation in
connection therewith or take any action in violation of applicable Law. 6.8 Commercially Reasonable Efforts.

(a) Purchaser and Merger Sub shall use commercially reasonable efforts to

Commitment Letters, (ii) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii)
negotiate and enter into all definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Commitment Letters (collectively, the "Debt Financing Documents") on a timely
basis on terms and conditions (including the "flex" provisions) contained
therein or otherwise not materially less favorable to Purchaser in the
aggregate than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letters, (iv) satisfy on
a timely basis all conditions applicable to Purchaser contained in the
applicable Debt Financing Documents within their control (or obtain a waiver
thereof), including the payment of any commitment, engagement or placement
fees required to be paid as a condition to the Debt Financing on or prior to
the Closing Date, (v) enforce in all material respects all of its rights under
or with respect to the applicable Debt Financing Documents upon the
satisfaction of the applicable conditions contained therein and (vi)
consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (it being understood
that it is not a condition to Closing under this Agreement for Purchaser to
obtain the Debt Financing). Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to keep the Sellers' Representative informed on a reasonable basis and
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing. Purchaser shall give the Sellers' Representative prompt (and in any
event, within two (2) Business Days) written notice of any of the following,
to the extent occurring prior to the Closing: (A) upon having knowledge of any
material breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any material breach or default) by any party of any of the Debt Financing
Documents or any termination of any of the Debt Financing Documents, (B) of
the receipt of any notice or other communication from any Person with respect
to any material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Debt Commitment Letters (it being understood and agreed that customary
negotiations with respect to the Debt Financing and the Debt Commitment
Letters (or any agreement related thereto) shall not constitute a material
dispute or disagreement) that relates to the termination of or the
satisfaction of the conditions to, the obligations of the Debt Financing
Sources party thereto to fund their applicable portion of the Debt Financing, (C) of the occurrence of an event or
development that would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse
impact on the ability of Purchaser to obtain all or any portion of the Debt
Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters and (D) if for any
reason (other than as a result of the failure of the conditions set forth in
Section 8.2 to be satisfied) Purchaser has determined in good faith that it
shall not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Debt Financing on the
terms, in the manner or from the sources contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event, within three (3)
Business Days following delivery by the Sellers' Representative to Purchaser
of written request therefor, Purchaser shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Sellers' Representative relating to any
circumstance referred to in clause (A), (B), (C) or (D) of the immediately
preceding sentence; provided that nothing in this sentence or the immediately
preceding sentence shall require Purchaser to provide any such information to
the extent disclosure could reasonably be expected to result in a waiver of
attorney client privilege (provided that, if any such access is limited for
the foregoing reason, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to establish a process that shall provide the Sellers' Representative with
timely access to the fullest extent possible to the substance of such
information). Other than as such terms may be modified in connection with the
exercise of any "flex" provisions provided for in the Debt Commitment Letter
and as set forth in Section 6.8(b), Purchaser shall not, without the prior
written consent of the Sellers' Representative, amend, modify, supplement or
waive any of the conditions or contingencies to funding contained in the Debt
Financing Documents or any other provision of, or remedies under, the Debt
Financing Documents, in each case to the extent such amendment, modification,
supplement or waiver would reasonably be expected to have the effect of (x)
adversely affecting in any respect the ability of Purchaser to timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including by
reducing the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Commitment Letters, (y) imposing new or additional conditions or otherwise
expanding, amending, modifying, supplementing or waiving the conditions to the
Debt Financing in a manner that would materially delay the Closing or make the
timely funding of the Debt Financing or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing materially less likely to occur or (z) adversely
affecting the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against the other
parties to the Debt Commitment Letters; provided that Purchaser shall be
permitted to amend the Debt Commitment Letter solely to add lenders, lead
arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or other agents and arrangers that
have not executed the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof. In the
event all conditions applicable to the Debt Financing Documents have been
satisfied and all of the conditions set forth in Article 9 have been satisfied
(other than those to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the Debt Financing Sources to fund the Debt Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on the
terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letters (as such
terms may be modified in connection with the exercise of any "flex" provisions
provided for therein), Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as
promptly as reasonably practicable, arrange and obtain alternative financing
in an amount sufficient, when added to any portion of the Debt Financing that
has not become unavailable and other available cash at Closing of Purchaser,
to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Purchaser in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("Alternative Debt Financing")
on terms not materially less favorable (including with respect to
conditionality to the availability and funding of the financing provided
thereby), in the aggregate, to Purchaser than those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters on
the date hereof (as such terms may be modified in connection with the exercise
of any "flex" provisions provided for therein). In such event, the term "Debt
Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any
Alternative Debt Financing and the term "Debt Commitment Letters" as used in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include the applicable documents for such
Alternative Debt Financing.

(c) Prior to the Closing, (i) the Company shall, and shall cause the other
Barteca Entities to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Barteca Entities' respective directors, officers and employees to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, and shall direct the Barteca Entities'
counsel, accountants and auditors to use commercially reasonable efforts to,
and (ii) each Blocker Seller shall, and shall cause its applicable Blocker to,
and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Blocker Seller's
and Blocker's respective directors, officers and employees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall direct each Blocker Seller's and Blocker's
respective counsel, accountants and auditors to use commercially reasonable
efforts to, in each case, provide reasonable cooperation with the arrangement
of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser, at
Purchaser's sole cost and expense (provided that such requested cooperation
does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Blockers or
the Barteca Entities), including by using their respective commercially
reasonable efforts in connection with any of the following matters:

(i) participating (including by making members of senior management with
appropriate seniority and expertise available) in a reasonable number of
meetings, presentations, due diligence sessions and drafting sessions and
sessions with rating agencies;

(ii) (A) furnishing Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources with the Required
Bank Information, as promptly as practicable and (B) upon reasonable request
by Purchaser, furnishing to the Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources
information relating to the Barteca Entities that is reasonably required by
Purchaser and such Debt Financing Sources to produce one or more customary
confidential information memoranda, investor presentations, bank information
memoranda, offering memoranda, private placement memoranda and other customary
marketing materials to be used in connection with such financing;

(iii) providing all information reasonably requested by Purchaser or the Debt
Financing Sources regarding the Barteca Entities under applicable "know your
customer", anti-money laundering rules and regulations and the USA PATRIOT Act
of 2001, in each case, requested at least ten (10) days prior to the Closing
Date;

(iv) assisting with Purchaser's preparation of definitive financing
documentation and the schedules and exhibits thereto, in each case,
customarily required to be delivered under such definitive financing
documents; provided that no obligation of any Barteca Entity under any such
document or agreement shall be effective until the Closing; and

(v) assisting Purchaser and the Debt Financing Sources in the preparation of a
customary rating agency presentations, bank information memoranda (including,
to the extent necessary, an additional bank information memorandum that does
not include material non-public information and customary authorization
letters) for any of the Debt Financing to the extent reasonably required
thereby; provided that none of the Unitholders nor the Barteca Entities shall be required to pay any commitment or other similar fee (except to the
extent reimbursed substantially concurrently by Purchaser or contingent upon
the Closing) or incur any other liability in connection with the Debt
Financing.

provided, further, that the effectiveness of any documentation executed by any
Blocker or any Barteca Entity with respect to the Debt Financing shall be
subject to the consummation of the Closing (other than as set forth in any
authorization letter delivered in connection with the Debt Financing). Any
information provided to Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.8(c) shall be
subject to the Confidentiality Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees
that none of the Unitholders nor any Barteca Entity nor any of their
respective Affiliates expressly for use in connection therewith or any of
their respective directors, officers, employees, representatives and advisors
(including legal, financial and accounting advisors) shall have any
responsibility for, and shall not be required to incur any liability (personal
or otherwise) to any person under or in connection with, the arrangement of
the Debt Financing or any Alternative Debt Financing that Purchaser may raise
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless the Unitholders, the Blockers, the
Barteca Entities and their respective Affiliates and representatives from and
against any and all Losses suffered or incurred by them in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith, except to the extent arising from (x) information provided by or on
behalf of the Blocker Sellers, the Blockers, the Barteca Entities or their
respective Affiliates or (y) the bad faith, willful misconduct or gross
negligence of the Blocker Sellers, the Blockers, the Barteca Entities or their
respective Affiliates. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
promptly reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket costs or expenses
incurred by the Blockers and the Barteca Entities and/or their respective
Affiliates in connection with cooperation provided for in this Section 6.9(c)
(including in connection with the preparation of the pro forma financial
statements that would be prescribed by Article 11 of Regulation S-X under the
Securities Act); provided, that Purchaser shall not be required to reimburse
the Company, the Blockers or the Barteca Entities for expenses incurred solely
in connection with actions taken by the Blockers and the Barteca Entities in
connection with the preparation of the Required Bank Information that the
Blockers and the Barteca Entities would otherwise have taken in connection
with their ordinary course activities. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that
obtaining the Debt Financing, or any other financing, is not a condition to
the Closing and reaffirms its obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement irrespective and independently of the
availability of the Debt Financing or any other financing, subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article 8.

(d) The Company and the Blockers, on behalf of themselves and their respective
Subsidiaries, hereby consent to the use of their logos solely in connection
with the Debt Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner
that is neither intended to nor reasonably likely to harm or disparage the
Barteca Entities or the Blockers or their respective reputations, goodwill or
marks.

6.10 Termination of Related Party Transactions. Other than any Related Party
Transaction set forth on Schedule 6.10, the Blocker Sellers, the Blockers and
the Company (i) shall cause all Related Party Transactions between any RCP
Party or any GA Party or any of their respective Affiliates, or Carl A.
Pforzheimer or Sasa Mahr-Batuz, on the one hand, and any Barteca Entity, any
Blocker or any Subsidiary of any Blocker, on the other hand, to be terminated
and shall cause each Blocker (and such Blocker's Subsidiaries, if any) and
each Barteca Entity to be released from all covenants, agreements and
Liabilities under or with respect to any such Related Party Transaction and (ii) shall use commercially reasonable efforts to identify any
other Related Party Transactions and to cause such other Related Party
Transactions to be terminated and each Blocker (and such Blocker's
Subsidiaries, if any) and each Barteca Entity, as applicable, to be released
from all covenants, agreements and liabilities under or with respect to such
other Related Party Transactions, in each case, whether arising prior to, at
or after the Closing and in each case, effective as of the Closing.

ARTICLE 7 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

7.1 Further Assurances. In case at any time after the Closing any further
action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery
of such further instruments and documents) as any other Party reasonably may
request, at the sole cost and expense of the requesting Party.

7.2 Press Releases. No press release or public announcement related to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, or prior to the Closing,
any other announcement or communication to the employees, customers or
suppliers of any Barteca Entity, shall be issued or made by any Party without
the joint approval of Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative, except (a) as
required by Law or the rules of any national securities exchange on which a
Party's securities are listed (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in which
case Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall have the right to review
such press release, announcement or communication prior to its issuance,
distribution or publication (it being understood that the Sellers'
Representative has approved Purchaser's initial press release announcing the
transactions contemplated thereby, which press release shall be substantially
in the form of the draft thereof attached as Exhibit F) (the "Announcement
Release") or (b) for any press release or other public announcement, including
any investor conference call, filing with the SEC, QandA or other publicly
disclosed document, that is consistent with the Announcement Release or any
such press release or other announcement or disclosure previously approved by
each of the Parties pursuant to this Section 7.2, to the extent such
disclosure is still accurate; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
restrict or prohibit any Barteca Entity from making any announcement, solely
to the extent that it does not include material non-public information
regarding Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, to its employees, customers and other
business relations to the extent such Barteca Entity reasonably determines in
good faith (after consultation with Purchaser) that such announcement is
necessary or advisable.

7.3 Transaction Expenses. Except as set forth in Section 7.7 with respect to
Transfer Taxes and for any Sellers' Transaction Expenses payable pursuant to
Section 1.11(f), each Party shall be solely responsible for payment of any
fees and expenses incurred by or on behalf of it or its Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise required by
applicable Law; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, except with respect
to actions taken by the Blockers and the Barteca Entities in connection with
the preparation of the Required Bank Information that the Blockers and the
Barteca Entities would otherwise have taken in connection with their ordinary
course activities, any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the
Blockers, the Barteca Entities or their respective Affiliates in connection
with cooperation provided for in Section 6.7 and Section 6.9(c) shall not
constitute a Sellers' Transaction Expense. 7.4 Directors' and Officers' Indemnification.

(a) From and after the Closing, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of
the Blockers and each of the Barteca Entities not to, amend, repeal or
otherwise modify the indemnification provisions of any Governing Documents of
any Blocker or any Barteca Entity as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of
individuals who, on or prior to the Closing, were directors, officers,
managers, employees or holders of equity interests of such Person (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties").

(b) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall, or shall cause the Blockers
and the Surviving Company to, obtain and fully pay for irrevocable "tail"
insurance policies naming all DandO Indemnified Parties as direct beneficiaries
with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Closing Date from an
insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the Barteca
Entities' current insurance carrier with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance in an amount and scope at least as favorable as the
Barteca Entities' existing policies with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Closing Date (such "tail" insurance policies, the
"DandO Policies"); provided, that Purchaser, the Blockers and the Surviving
Company shall not be required to pay for such DandO Policies in an annual amount
in excess of 300% of the annual premium for the twelve (12) month period
beginning on the Closing Date; provided, further, that if the annual premium
of any such DandO Policy exceeds such amount, Purchaser shall be obligated to
obtain, or cause the Blockers and the Surviving Company to obtain, a policy
with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such maximum
amount. Purchaser shall not, and shall cause the Blockers and the Barteca
Entities not to, cancel or change any such DandO Policies in any respect.

(c) In the event Purchaser, any Blocker, any Barteca Entity or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity in such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then and in either such case,
Purchaser shall make proper provision so that the successors and assigns of
Purchaser, the applicable Blocker or the applicable Barteca Entities, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section 7.4. The
provisions of this Section 7.4 shall survive indefinitely the consummation of
the Closing.

7.5 Post-Closing Record Retention and Access. From and after the Closing,
Purchaser shall provide the Sellers' Representative and its authorized
Representatives with reasonable access (for the purpose of examining and
copying), during normal business hours, to any books and records and other
materials in the possession of the Barteca Entities relating to periods prior
to the Closing Date in connection with general business purposes, whether or
not relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the preparation of financial statements for
periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date, and the management and
handling of any Action, whether or not such Action is a matter with respect to
which indemnification may be sought hereunder), in compliance with the rules
and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other
Governmental Authority. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by the
Sellers' Representative, Purchaser shall not, and shall cause each of the
Blockers and the Barteca Entities not to, for a period of seven (7) years
following the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of any books
and records and other materials of the Barteca Entities, or any portions
thereof, relating to periods prior to the Closing Date without first offering
to surrender to the Sellers' Representative such books and records and
materials or such portions thereof. Any information or documents accessed by the Sellers' Representative pursuant to
this Section 7.5 shall be subject to Section 7.9. This Section 7.5 shall not
apply with respect to Tax Return or other Tax matters (which shall be governed
exclusively by Section 7.6(a)).

7.6 Other Tax Provisions.

(a) Additional Cooperation on Tax Matters. Each Party shall cooperate fully,
as and to the extent reasonably requested by any other Party, in connection
with (i) the preparation and filing of any Tax Return of or with respect to
the Barteca Entities and the Blockers, (ii) the preparation for and
prosecution or defense of any Tax Action with respect to any of the Barteca
Entities and the Blockers and (iii) determining any liability for Taxes of or
with respect to the Barteca Entities and the Blockers. Such cooperation shall
include (A) the retention and (upon the other Party's request) the provision
of records and information which are reasonably relevant to any such Tax
Return or Tax Action or any tax planning and relevant records concerning the
ownership and Tax basis of property and other relevant information, in each
case which such Party or its Affiliates may possess, and (B) making employees
available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and
explanation of any material provided hereunder. Each Party agrees to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Barteca
Entities and the Blockers relating to any Tax period beginning before the
Closing Date until expiration of the statute of limitations of the respective
Tax periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with
any Tax Authority. Each Party agrees, upon request, to use their commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain or execute any certificate or other document from
any Governmental Authority or any other Person (including powers of attorney)
as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
imposed on or with respect to the Barteca Entities and the Blockers
(including, but not limited to, any Transfer Taxes).

(b) Preparation of Tax Returns. Purchaser shall prepare and file, or cause to
be prepared and filed, all Tax Returns of the Barteca Entities and the
Blockers for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period that are due after
the Closing Date (taking into account extensions validly obtained). With
respect to any such Tax Return that is a Pass-Through Tax Return or for which
the Blocker Sellers or the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker
Units) would reasonably be expected to have an indemnification obligation
hereunder (including an obligation pursuant to Section 7.6(f) or Section 7.7),
Purchaser shall (i) prepare such Tax-Return in accordance with past practice
of the applicable Barteca Entity or Blocker (unless otherwise required by
applicable Law) and (ii) in the case of any Tax Return with respect to income
Taxes, no later than thirty (30) days prior to filing any such Tax Return, and
in the case of any Tax Return with respect to non-income Taxes, no later than
ten (10) days prior to filing any such Tax Return, Purchaser shall provide to
the Sellers' Representative drafts of such Tax Return and shall, prior to
filing thereof, make any changes thereto reasonably requested in writing by
the Sellers' Representative within ten (10) days of receipt thereof, to the
extent such changes are permitted by applicable Law; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.6(b), Purchaser
shall, in its sole discretion, be permitted to determine whether to make an
election under Section 754 of the Code on any Pass-Through Tax Return with
respect to a Tax period of a Barteca Entity ending on and including the
Closing Date; provided, further, that Purchaser shall not be required to file
any Tax Return, or take any position thereon, and clause (i) shall therefore
not apply, to the extent that Purchaser or the applicable Barteca Entity or
Blocker reasonably determine, with the written advice of independent Tax
counsel, that there is not at least "substantial authority," within the
meaning of Section 6662(d)(2)(B)(i) of the Code (or any corresponding or
similar provision of state, local or non-U.S. Law), for a particular position. If Purchaser is not authorized under
applicable Law to execute and file any Tax Return prepared by Purchaser
pursuant to this Section 7.6(b), Sellers' Representative shall execute and
file (or cause to be executed and filed) such Tax Return (as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 7.6(b)) with the appropriate Tax
Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of
this Section 7.6(b), to the extent any Tax liability would be recovered under
the RandW Policy (and not from the Blocker Sellers or the Unitholders), it shall
not be taken into account as an obligation of the Blocker Sellers and the
Unitholders in determining whether the Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders
have any indemnification obligation hereunder.

(c) Audits of Tax Returns. Each Party agrees to provide written notice to the
other Parties within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of any written notice by
the first party that involves the assertion of any Tax Action or similar
matter relating to any Tax Return of a Barteca Entity or Blocker for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. Such notice shall specify in reasonable
detail the basis for such Tax Action or similar matter and shall include a
copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence received from a Tax
Authority. The Sellers' Representative shall have the responsibility for, and
the right to control, any Tax Actions with respect to Pass-Through Tax Returns
of the Barteca Entities and the Blockers relating solely to any Tax period
ending on or before the Closing Date, including any disposition or settlement
of such Tax Action to the extent such action would reasonably be expected to
adversely impact the Unitholders (other than the Blockers or the Blocker
Sellers); provided, however, that (A) the Sellers' Representative shall keep
Purchaser reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax Action; (B)
Purchaser shall have the right, directly or through its designated
Representatives, to review in advance and comment upon all submissions made in
the course of such Tax Action (including any administrative appeals thereof),
(C) Purchaser's prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) shall be required for any settlement, resolution or
abandonment of such Tax Action (or any portion thereof) by the Sellers'
Representative that could adversely impact the Tax liability of Purchaser, any
of the Blockers or any of the Barteca Entities in any Tax period and (D) the
Sellers' Representative shall not, and shall not cause any Barteca Entity to,
elect to apply any provision of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 (or any
similar provision of state or local Law) for a taxable year beginning before
January 1, 2018. Except as specifically provided in this Section 7.6(c),
Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control any other Tax Action of or
with respect to the Barteca Entities and the Blockers; provided, however, that
to the extent any such Tax Action relates to a Tax Return of a Barteca Entity
or Blocker for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period (other than any
Tax Action that the Sellers' Representative has the right to control pursuant
to the prior sentence) and would reasonably be expected to adversely impact
the Tax liability of the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units)
or the Blocker Sellers in any Tax period: (1) Purchaser shall keep the
Sellers' Representative reasonably informed regarding the status of such Tax
Action, (2) the Sellers' Representative shall have the right, directly or
through its designated representatives, to review in advance and comment upon
all submissions made in the course of such Tax Action (including any
administrative appeals thereof) and (3) the Sellers' Representative's prior
written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
shall be required for any settlement, resolution or abandonment of such Tax
Action (or any portion thereof) by Purchaser.

(d) Tax Refunds. (i) GA Interholdco shall be entitled to any refunds (or
credits received in lieu of such refunds) received for Taxes paid for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the GA Blocker (the "GA Blocker Tax Refund"), (ii) each
RCP Blocker Stockholder, in accordance with the percentages set forth opposite
such RCP Blocker Stockholder's name on Schedule 1.1, shall be entitled to any refunds (or credits received in lieu of such refunds)
received for Taxes paid for any Pre-Closing Tax Period of the RCP Blocker (the
"RCP Blocker Tax Refund" and together with the GA Blocker Tax Refund, the
"Blocker Tax Refunds") and (iii) the Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders
(other than any holder of Blocker Units) shall be entitled to any refunds (or
credits received in lieu of such refunds) received for Taxes paid for any Pre-
Closing Tax Period of the Barteca Entities (including, for the avoidance of
doubt, any refunds of employment, payroll and similar Taxes paid or withheld
by the Barteca Entities in respect of employees or other service providers of,
the Barteca Entities prior to the Closing) (each, a "Barteca Tax Refund"), in
each case along with any interest paid by the relevant Tax Authority with
respect thereto; provided that Blocker Tax Refunds and Barteca Tax Refunds
shall exclude any Tax refund (or credit in lieu of such refund) (A) resulting
from the carryback of a net operating loss from a Tax period (or portion
thereof) ending after the Closing Date to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (B) with
respect to Taxes which are economically borne by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Barteca Entities) or (C) to the
extent such Tax refund (or credit in lieu of such refund) was included in the
final calculation of the Actual Working Capital. Purchaser shall be entitled
to any refunds (or credits received in lieu of such refunds) received for
taxes paid by any of the Barteca Entities or the Blockers other than the
Blocker Tax Refunds and the Barteca Tax Refunds. Any Party (or any of its
Affiliates) that receives a refund (or credit received in lieu of such refund)
to which another Party is entitled under this Section 7.6(d) shall pay the
amount of such refund (or credit received in lieu of such refund), net of (1)
any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with obtaining
such refund or credit, and (2) in the case of a Barteca Tax Refund resulting
from a Tax Action that is described in clause (iii) of the proviso in the
definition of Pre-Closing Taxes, any amounts paid or payable by the Company
that are described in clause (iii) of the proviso in the definition of Pre-
Closing Taxes, to the Party entitled thereto within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt thereof. At the request of the Sellers' Representative,
Purchaser and its Affiliates shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any such Blocker Tax Refunds and/or Barteca Tax Refunds.

(e) No Amendments or Restatements. Purchaser and its Affiliates (including
after the Closing, the Barteca Entities and the Blockers) shall not file, or
cause to be filed, any restatement or amendment of, modification to, or claim
for refund relating to, or enter into any voluntary disclosure agreement
relating to, any Tax Return of the Barteca Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period without the prior written consent of the Sellers' Representative (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the extent any such
action could reasonably be expected to adversely impact the Tax liability of
the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units) or the Blocker
Sellers with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each case except to the
extent otherwise required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section
1313(a) of the Code. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
Purchaser and its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Barteca
Entities and the Blockers) shall treat the GA Blocker Note as indebtedness of
the GA Blocker for U.S. federal and applicable state and local income Tax
purposes and shall not take any position to the contrary on any Tax Return or
in connection with any Tax Action, in each case except to the extent otherwise
required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

(f) Straddle Periods. In the case of a Straddle Period, the Taxes allocable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined based on a deemed closing of
the books at the end of the Closing Date in the case of income, profits,
sales, employment and other Taxes readily apportionable between periods
(provided that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an
annual basis, such as the deduction for amortization or depreciation, shall be apportioned on a daily basis notwithstanding that such exemptions, allowances
or deductions may under applicable Law be determined solely at the end of the
applicable Tax period) and, in the case of all other Taxes, in proportion to
the number of days in the Tax period on and before the Closing Date; provided
that in the case of Taxes in the form of penalties or interest (other than
interest solely reflecting time value of deferral), all such Taxes shall be
treated as attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date to the extent attributable solely to an action by any Barteca
Entity, or by any of the Blocker Sellers or the Unitholders (other than any
holder of Blocker Units) with respect to any Barteca Entity, in each case
prior to the Closing, whether such items are incurred, accrued, assessed or
similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

(g) Disputes. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Section 7.6 shall
be resolved by the Arbiter. The fees and expenses of the Arbiter shall be
borne equally by the Sellers' Representative and Purchaser. If any dispute
with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date for filing
such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the Party
responsible for preparing such Tax Return deems correct, but the content of
such Tax Return shall not prejudice, control or otherwise resolve the dispute
hereunder.

(h) Tax Sharing Agreements. The Barteca Entities and the Blockers shall cause
any Tax sharing, Tax allocation, Tax indemnity or similar agreements or
arrangements (excluding any such agreement or arrangement entered into in the
ordinary course of business the primary purpose of which does not relate to
Taxes) to which any of the Barteca Entities or the Blockers is a party or
subject to be terminated on or prior to the Closing Date. After the Closing
Date, none of the Barteca Entities or the Blockers shall be bound thereby or
have any obligations or liability thereunder (whether related to any period
before or after the Closing).

7.7 Transfer Taxes. All sales (including bulk sales), use, documentary,
registration, real estate, conveyance, excise, license, stamp duty or transfer
taxes and recording charges and similar taxes, duties, fees or charges imposed
as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively,
the "Transfer Taxes"), together with any interest, penalties or additions to
such Transfer Taxes, shall be borne equally by Purchaser, on the one hand, and
the Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders, on the other hand. The Sellers'
Representative and Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate in timely making all
filings, returns, reports and forms as necessary or appropriate to comply with
the provisions of all applicable Laws in connection with the payment of such
Transfer Taxes, and shall cooperate in good faith to minimize, to the fullest
extent possible under such Laws, the amount of any such Transfer Taxes payable
in connection therewith.

7.8 Certain Employee and Employee Benefits Matters.

(a) For at least one (1) year following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or
shall cause its Affiliates (including the Surviving Company) to, provide each
employee of each Barteca Entity who continues to be employed by a Barteca
Entity, Purchaser, the Surviving Company or any of their respective Affiliates
following the Closing Date (each, a "Continuing Employee") with (i) an annual
base salary or hourly wage rate and cash incentive compensation opportunity
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) employee
benefits (excluding severance and equity arrangements) that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than those provided to such Continuing Employee as
of the Closing Date. (b) Purchaser agrees that, from and after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall
and shall cause the Surviving Company, each Barteca Entity and each of their
respective Affiliates to provide each Continuing Employee with credit for
service with a Barteca Entity earned prior to the Closing Date (i) for
eligibility and vesting purposes and (ii) for purposes of vacation accrual and
severance benefit determinations, in each case, under any benefit or
compensation plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement that may be
established or maintained by Purchaser, the Surviving Company, any Barteca
Entity or any of their respective Affiliates on or after the Closing Date and
to the extent that such plans, programs, policies, agreements or arrangements
provide benefits to such Continuing Employees following such date (the "New
Plans"); provided that the foregoing service credit shall not be required to
apply (i) to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits with respect to the same period of service or (ii) for purposes of
any defined benefit pension accrual under any New Plan. In addition, Purchaser
and the Surviving Company shall (A) cause to be waived all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements and similar
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any New Plans to the extent waived or satisfied by an
employee or his or her dependents under any Plan as of the Closing Date and
(B) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-of-pocket expenses paid
on or before the Closing Date by any employee (or covered dependent thereof)
of any Barteca Entity to be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the
corresponding deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions
after the Closing Date under any applicable New Plan in the year of initial
participation. Purchaser agrees that Purchaser, the Surviving Company and the
Barteca Entities (following the Closing) (i) shall be solely responsible for
satisfying the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code
for all individuals who are "MandA qualified beneficiaries" (as such term is
defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9) in respect of the Barteca
Entities (including the individuals set forth on Schedule 10.2(a)(v) and any
other Related Person who, as of the date hereof, participates in any Plan that
is a medical plan, who shall be deemed to be such MandA qualified beneficiaries,
it being acknowledged and agreed that nothing in Section 6.10 shall prohibit
any Related Person who participates in any such Plan from electing any such
continuation coverage) and (ii) shall not take any action that could
reasonably be expected to cause any employee of the Barteca Entities to cease
to be eligible for, or otherwise fail to qualify for, such continuation
coverage.

(c) Nothing contained in this Section 7.8, express or implied, shall (i)
constitute an amendment to or any other modification of any Plan or any
employee benefit plan maintained by Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (each, a "Purchaser Plan") or (subject to Purchaser's compliance
with the other provisions of this Section 7.8) constitute a limitation on
rights to amend, modify, merge or terminate after the Closing Date any Plan or
Purchaser Plan, (ii) other than with respect to any Party, give any current or
former employee, director or consultant of the Barteca Entities and their
Affiliates or Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof),
or any labor organization, union, works council, employee association, trade
union, other similar employee representative body, any third-party beneficiary
or other rights or (iii) obligate Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular employee benefit plan, program,
agreement or arrangement or (B) retain the employment or services of any
current or former employee, director or consultant of the Barteca Entities or
their Affiliates or Subsidiaries.

7.9 Confidentiality. Each of the Blocker Sellers and the Sellers'
Representative acknowledges and agrees that, by reason of its ownership of the
Barteca Entities and the Blockers, as applicable, it may have acquired
Confidential Information, the use or disclosure of which could cause Purchaser
and its controlled Affiliates (including the Blockers and the Barteca substantial loss and damages that may not be readily calculated and for which
no remedy at law may be adequate. Accordingly, each of the Blocker Sellers and
the Sellers' Representative agrees that, until the date that is two (2) years
after the Closing Date, none of the Blocker Sellers, the Sellers'
Representative or any of their respective controlled Affiliates (the "Covered
Persons") shall, at any time, except as expressly required or permitted by
this Agreement, directly or indirectly, disclose or publish any Confidential
Information, except for any disclosure with respect to which any Covered
Person is requested or required by applicable Law or legal process or the
rules of any national securities exchange on which such Covered Person's
securities are traded; provided that (a) prior to disclosing any such
Confidential Information, (i) Purchaser shall have the reasonable opportunity
to seek an appropriate protective order or other remedy and (ii) the Covered
Person shall consult and cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchaser's sole cost
and expense, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law with respect to
taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such requirement and (b) if (i)
such a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or if Purchaser waives
compliance with the terms of this Section 7.9, and (ii) such Covered Person is
nonetheless, in the opinion of counsel, required by applicable Law to disclose
Confidential Information, such Covered Person shall (A) disclose only that
portion of the Confidential Information that they are advised by counsel is
legally required, (B) give advance notice to Purchaser of the information to
be disclosed as far in advance as is practical and (C) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment
shall be accorded to such Confidential Information; provided, further, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7.9, nothing herein
shall prevent the Covered Persons (including any managed private equity funds)
from making customary disclosures concerning the terms of their investment in
the Company, the terms of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby and other customary information to their respective investors and
potential investors and those of their Representatives who have a need to know
such information in connection with any such disclosures to investors and
potential investors and who, in each case, are subject to customary
confidentiality obligations. As used in this Agreement, "Confidential
Information" means any confidential and proprietary information of the Barteca
Entities, including information that has not been disclosed to the public or
to the trade with respect to any Barteca Entity's present or future business,
operations, services, products, research, inventions, discoveries, drawings,
designs, plans, processes, models, technical information, facilities, methods,
trade secrets, copyrights, software, source code, systems, patents,
procedures, manuals, specifications, any other intellectual property,
confidential reports, financial information (including the revenues, costs or
profits associated with any of the Barteca Entities' products or services),
business plans, lease structures, projections, prospects, opportunities or
strategies, acquisitions or mergers, advertising or promotions, personnel
matters, legal matters, any other confidential and proprietary information.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include
information that (x) is or becomes generally known to the public through no
fault of a Covered Person or its Representatives, (y) is or becomes available
to a Covered Person or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a
source other than Purchaser, any Barteca Entity, any Blocker or any of their
respective Representatives; provided that such source was not known by such
Covered Person to be bound by any confidentiality obligation with respect to
such information or (z) was or is independently developed by such Covered
Person without use of or reference to any Confidential Information. Purchaser
acknowledges that certain Confidential Information may enhance the Covered
Persons' knowledge and understanding of the industry of Purchaser and the
Barteca Entities in a way that cannot be separated from such Covered Person's
other knowledge and Purchaser agrees that, without limiting the obligations of
the Covered Persons under this Section 7.9, this Section 7.9 shall not
restrict any Covered Person's use of such overall knowledge and understanding of such industry for its own internal purposes,
including the purchase, sale, consideration of, and decisions related to other
investments. Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the Covered Persons
are or may be engaged in the business of evaluating, making and managing
investments in businesses and acquiring businesses and it is possible that one
or more of those businesses are or may in the future be competitive with
Purchaser or the Barteca Entities or their respective Affiliates in some way.
The obligations of the Covered Persons in this Section 7.9 will not be
construed in any way to restrict such Covered Persons from investing in or
acquiring any such businesses. Nothing contained herein shall limit any
Covered Person's ability to disclose information in accordance with the terms
of this Agreement.

7.10 Consents. Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub acknowledges that certain
consents to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required
from parties to contracts, leases, licenses (including the Liquor Licenses) or
other agreements to which any Barteca Entity is a party (including the
Contracts set forth on Schedule 2.4 and Schedule 2.14) and such consents may
not be obtained. Without limiting any of Purchaser's rights under, or any
obligations of the Company, the RCP Parties, the GA Parties or the Unitholders
under, Section 8.2(a), Section 8.2(b), Section 9.1(b) or Section 10.2(a), each
of Purchaser and Merger Sub agrees and acknowledges that none of the Company,
RCP Parties, GA Parties or Unitholders will have any liability whatsoever to
Purchaser or Merger Sub (or the Surviving Company following the Closing) (and
Purchaser and Merger Sub (or the Surviving Company following the Closing) will
not be entitled to assert any claims) solely to the extent arising out of or
relating to the failure to obtain any consents that may have been or may be
required, pursuant to the terms of any Contract set forth on Schedule 2.4 or
Schedule 6.2, to be obtained prior to the Closing.

7.11 Additional Covenants. The Parties shall comply with the covenants set
forth on Schedule 7.12.

(b) by Purchaser providing written notice to the Sellers' Representative, if
there has been a breach of the representations and warranties or covenants and
agreements by the Company, the Blockers or the Blocker Sellers set forth in
this Agreement, which would result in the failure of the conditions set forth
in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) to be satisfied (so long as Purchaser (i) has
provided the Sellers' Representative with written notice of such breach and
the breach has continued without cure until the earlier of (A) twenty (20)
days following the date of such notice of breach and (B) the Termination Date)
and (ii) is not in breach of any of its representations and warranties or
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement which would result in the

there has been a breach of the representations and warranties or covenants and
agreements by Purchaser or Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement, which would
result in the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(a) or 8.1(b)
to be satisfied (so long as (i) the Sellers' Representative has provided
Purchaser with written notice of such breach and the breach has continued
without cure until the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days following the date of
such notice of breach and (B) the Termination Date); provided that the failure
by Purchaser to make the payments set forth in Section 1.11 as and when
required hereunder shall not be subject to cure hereunder unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the Sellers' Representative, and (ii) the Company, the
Blockers or the Blocker Sellers are not in breach of their representations and
warranties or covenants and agreements in this agreement which would result in
the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or 8.2(b));

notice to the other, if the Closing has not occurred by 5:00 p.m. on July 20,
2018 (the "Termination Date"); provided that (i) Purchaser shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if
Purchaser's or Merger Sub's breach of this Agreement has prevented the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby at or prior to such time
and (ii) the Sellers' Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(d) if the Company's, any of the

effect, and no Party shall have any liability to any other Party or its
members, stockholders, managers or directors or officers in respect thereof;

including with respect to a Third-Party Claim, by delivering written notice
thereof (a "Claim Notice") in accordance with Section 11.3 to the Party from
which indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 10.2 (the "Indemnifying
Person"). Each Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of
the claim, provide an estimate of the amount of Losses claimed in connection
with such claim (to the extent then reasonably estimable) and specify the
provisions of this Agreement giving rise to such claim.

(ii) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Person of a Claim Notice in respect of a
Claim brought by a Person that is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party (a
"Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to (A) assume
and have sole control over the defense and investigation of such Third-Party
Claim at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last sentence of this
Section 10.2(d)(ii)) and with counsel of its own choosing if it gives notice
of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of such Claim Notice by the Indemnified Person and (B)
negotiate a settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of an Order
with respect to, such Claim; provided that, if (1) such settlement, compromise
or consent does not include a full and unconditional waiver and release by
such Third Party of all applicable Indemnified Persons for all Losses with
respect to such Third-Party Claim, (2) such settlement, compromise or consent
imposes a Lien on any of the assets of any such Indemnified Person or (3) such
settlement, compromise or consent results or would reasonably be expected to
result in a material restriction or condition that would apply to or affect
any such Indemnified Person, or the conduct of any such Indemnified Person's
business, or would have a material adverse effect on the reputation of such
Indemnified Person or any of its Affiliates, such settlement, compromise or
consent shall be permitted only with the prior written consent of such
Indemnified Person (whether or not such Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such Third-
Party Claim), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. If the Indemnifying Person elects to assume control of the defense
and investigation of any such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Person
shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) such defense and
investigation with counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnifying Person at
such Indemnified Person's sole cost and expense; provided, however, that, if
in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the Indemnified Person, there exists a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified
Person that cannot be waived, the Indemnifying Person shall, subject to the
limitations set forth in this Article 10, be liable for the reasonable fees
and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Person.

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 10.2(d)(ii), the
Indemnifying Person shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense or
investigation of any Third-Party Claim that (A) seeks as the sole remedy an
injunction or other equitable relief against an Indemnified Person, (B)
involves an allegation that an Indemnified Person committed a criminal act or
(C) would reasonably be expected to result in Losses to all applicable
Indemnified Persons which, taken with other then-existing Losses for which
such Indemnifying Person is obligated to provide indemnification under this
Article 10, would exceed by more than 50% the then-remaining limit of
liability of such Indemnified Person under Section 10.2(c) (including by
virtue of disbursements from the Indemnification Escrow Fund). If, within
thirty (30) days after delivery by an Indemnified Person of any Claim Notice
with respect to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person (1) (I) notifies
such Indemnified Person in writing that the Indemnifying Person does not elect
to defend and investigate such Third-Party Claim or (II) fails to deliver to
the Indemnified Person a written election to assume the defense and
investigation of such Third-Party Claim or (2) is not entitled to assume the
defense or investigation of such Third-Party Claim, then (x) such Indemnified
Person may, at its option (upon advance written notice of at least three (3)
Business Days), defend, investigate, settle or compromise, or consent to an
entry of an Order with respect to, such Third-Party Claim; provided that any
such settlement, compromise or consent shall be permitted only with the
written consent of the Indemnifying Person (whether or not the Indemnifying
Person is an actual or potential party to such Third-Party Claim), which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and (y)
the Indemnifying Person may participate in (but not control) any such defense
and investigation at its sole cost and expense.

(iv) No later than three (3) Business Days after (A) the issuance of any final
Order (and the expiration of the time in which to appeal therefrom), (B) a
settlement shall have been consummated between the Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Person or (C) the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person
shall have entered into any Contract, in each case, determining the amount of
any indemnification payment owed to an Indemnified Person pursuant to this
Article 10, the applicable Indemnifying Person shall pay the amount payable to
such Indemnified Person in accordance with and subject to the limitations set
forth in this Article 10, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
an account designated in writing by such Indemnified Person; provided that, if
the Indemnifying Person is a Seller Indemnifying Person, such payment shall be
made solely pursuant to Section 10.2(h)(i) (other than with respect to any
indemnification obligation of a Seller Indemnifying Person under (1) Section
10.2(a)(ii)(B), (2) Section 10.2(a)(iv) and (3) Section 10.2(a)(v).

(v) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.2(d) to the contrary, this
Section 10.2(d) shall not apply for purposes of any Third-Party Claim that is
a Tax Action, which shall be governed by Section 7.6(c). (e) Mitigation; Alternative Recoveries.

(i) Except with respect to Taxes, each Party shall use its commercially
reasonably efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it may claim
indemnification under Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b); provided, however,
that Purchaser shall not be required to seek any recovery under the RandW Policy
in respect of any such Losses.

(ii) Any Losses indemnifiable under Section 10.2(a) or Section 10.2(b) shall
be (i) net of any amount actually recovered (whether by way of payment,
discount, credit, off-set, counterclaim or otherwise) by the Indemnified
Person with respect to such Losses under Alternative Arrangements, and (ii)
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such Losses constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement. Each of the
Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to, use
commercially reasonable efforts to seek full recovery under all Alternative
Arrangements covering any such Losses to the same extent as they would if such
Losses were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an
insurance or other recovery is made by the Unitholders (other than any holder
of Blocker Interests) or Blocker Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchaser, on
the other hand, with respect to any Losses for which any such Person has been
indemnified hereunder (other than, in the case of Purchaser, recovery under
the RandW Policy), then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery
(if and to the extent such amount of recovery would have reduced the amount to
which such Person would have been entitled to pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 10.2(e)(ii)) shall be made promptly to the applicable
indemnifying Party.

(f) Materiality Scrape. For purposes of this Section 10.2 only, (i) a breach
(or failure to be true and correct) of a representation or warranty in this
Agreement as of the date hereof or as of the Closing as if made anew as of the
Closing, shall be deemed to exist either if such representation or warranty
(A) is actually breached or actually fails to be true and correct as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing as if made anew as of the Closing or (B)
would have been breached or would have failed to be true and correct as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing as if made anew as of the Closing if such
representation or warranty had not contained any limitation or qualification
as to "in all material respects," "material" or "Material Adverse Effect" set
forth in such representation or warranty, and (ii) the amount of Losses in
respect of any such breach or failure, including any deemed breach or failure
pursuant to the foregoing clause (a), shall be determined without regard to
any such limitation or qualification as to "in all material respects,"
"material" or "Material Adverse Effect" set forth in such representation or
warranty.

(g) Adjustments to Purchase Price. The Parties agree that any indemnification
payments pursuant to this Section 10.2 shall be treated as an adjustment to
the applicable purchase price for Tax purposes to the maximum extent permitted
by applicable Law.

(h) Escrow; Escrow Releases.

(i) The Indemnification Escrow Fund (A) shall be the exclusive source of
funding for any indemnification obligation of a Seller Indemnifying Person
under Section 10.2(a) (other than (A) Section 10.2(a)(ii)(B), (B) Section
10.2(a)(iv) and (C) Section 10.2(a)(v)) and (B) may be a nonexclusive source
of funding for any indemnification obligation of a Seller Indemnifying Person
under Section 10.2(a)(ii)(B) or Section 10.2(a)(iv). (ii) No later than five (5) Business Days following first (1st) anniversary of
the Closing Date, Purchaser and the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the
Escrow Agent to pay to the Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, the Initial Release Amount. As used in this Agreement, the
"Initial Release Amount" means an amount equal to the difference of (A) the
Indemnification Escrow Fund as of the date of release, minus (B) the sum of
(1) all amounts, if any, that, as of the first (1st) anniversary of the
Closing Date, represent claimed Losses under then-pending indemnification
claims subject to Claim Notices ("Outstanding Claims"), plus (2) any amount
due to Purchaser from the Indemnification Escrow Fund pursuant to
indemnification claims that have been finally resolved in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement but which the Escrow Agent has not yet
released from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to Purchaser. As promptly as
reasonably practicable after receipt of the Initial Release Amount, the Paying
Agent shall disburse the Initial Release Amount to the Blocker Sellers and the
Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units) in accordance with the
Distribution Waterfall. With respect to any Outstanding Claim, the Parties
agree that, as and when any such Outstanding Claim is resolved, Purchaser and
the Sellers' Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay to the
Paying Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, the applicable
Resolved Amount. As used in this Agreement, "Resolved Amount" means, with
respect to any Outstanding Claim, an amount equal to the difference of (A) the
amount claimed by Purchaser with respect to such Outstanding Claim, minus (B)
all amounts released from the Indemnification Escrow Fund to Purchaser with
respect to such Outstanding Claim.

10.3 Exclusive Remedy; Release; Fraud.

(a) Without limiting any rights of Purchaser or its Affiliates under the RandW
Policy, from and after the Closing, the provisions of Section 1.12, Article
10, Article 11 (including the provisions of Section 11.9 with respect to any
breach or threatened breach of any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement, in any other document contemplated hereby, or in any certificate
delivered hereunder or thereunder, that contemplates performance after the
Closing), any Completed LoT, the Paying Agent Agreement and the Escrow
Agreement (such provisions, collectively, the "Remedy Provisions") shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy for any Action (whether in contract or in tort
or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in
equity) that may be based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution, performance or subject matter of this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Losses alleged to be
suffered by any Party as a result of the actions or failure to act by any
Party in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, and without limiting any of
the Parties rights under the Remedy Provisions, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law (including under Environmental Laws), effective
only from and after the Closing, Purchaser waives any and all rights, claims
and causes of action it may have against any of the RCP Parties, the GA
Parties and the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units) and each
of their respective former, current or future Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, partners, members, equityholders, managers, agents, advisors,
successors or permitted assigns, excluding, in each case, any Person who
continues to be an officer, employee, agent or advisor of the Barteca Entities
after the Closing relating to the operation of the Barteca Entities or their
respective businesses, or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or
any other document contemplated hereby, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, in each case, whether or not arising under, or based upon, any Law
(including any right, whether arising at law or in equity, to seek
indemnification, contribution, cost recovery, damages, or any other recourse
or remedy). Furthermore, without limiting the generality of this Section from and after the Closing, (i) Purchaser shall not be entitled to rescind
this Agreement or treat this Agreement as terminated by reason of any breach
of this Agreement, and (ii) Purchaser hereby waives any and all rights of
rescission it may have in respect of any such matter. Purchaser, the RCP
Parties, the GA Parties and the Unitholders acknowledge and agree, on their
own behalf and on behalf of each of their respective Affiliates, as the case
may be, that the agreements contained in this Section 10.3(a) (A) require
performance after the Closing to the maximum extent permitted by applicable
Law and shall survive the Closing for twenty (20) years; and (B) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without the
agreements set forth in this Section 10.3(a), none of the Parties would enter
into this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) nothing in
this Article 10 prohibits, hinders, limits or otherwise restricts any Party's
right to bring an Action for, or any Party's Liability for, Fraud, and (ii)
none of Purchaser, Merger Sub or any of their respective Representatives
disclaim reliance on any representation and warranty expressly made in a
Completed LoT.

ARTICLE 11 

MISCELLANEOUS

11.1 Sellers' Representative.

(a) Rosser Capital Partners Management, L.P. is constituted and appointed as
the Sellers' Representative. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"Sellers' Representative" shall mean the representative, true and lawful
agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact of the Blocker Sellers, the Company, the
Blockers and the Unitholders (the "Represented Parties") for all purposes of
this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, with full power and authority on such
Person's behalf to: (i) consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) pay such Person's expenses (whether incurred on or after the
date hereof) incurred in connection with the negotiation and performance of
this Agreement, (iii) receive, give receipt and disburse any funds received
hereunder on behalf of such Person and to hold back from disbursement any such
funds to the extent it reasonably determines may be necessary, (iv) execute
and deliver any certificates representing the Blocker Interests and/or Company
Units, if any, and execute such further instruments as Purchaser shall
reasonably request, (v) execute and deliver on behalf of such Person all
documents contemplated herein and any amendment or waiver hereto, (vi) take
all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Person in connection
herewith, (vii) negotiate, settle, compromise and otherwise handle all
disputes under this Agreement, including without limitation, disputes pursuant
to Section 1.12, (viii) waive any condition to the obligation of such Person
to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ix) give and
receive notices on behalf of such Person and (x) do each and every act and
exercise any and all rights which such Person is, or the Represented Parties
collectively are, permitted or required to do or exercise under this
Agreement. The Represented Parties, by executing and delivering this
Agreement, approving the terms of this Agreement and/or accepting any of the
consideration payable to them hereunder, irrevocably grant unto the Sellers'
Representative full power and authority to do and perform each and every act
and thing necessary or desirable to be done in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as fully to all intents and
purposes as the Represented Parties might or could do in person. Each of the
Represented Parties (other than the Blockers) agrees that such agency and are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable (except as set forth
in Section 11.1(h)) without the consent of the Sellers' Representative and
shall survive the death, incapacity or bankruptcy of any of the Represented
Parties; provided, that without limitation of the power and authority of the
Sellers' Representative to take any action expressly set forth in this Section
11.1 on behalf of the Represented Parties, the Sellers' Representative shall
not constitute the attorney-in-fact of the GA Parties.

(b) All decisions, actions, consents and instructions of the Sellers'
Representative shall be final and binding upon all of the Represented Parties
and none of Represented Parties shall have any right to object, dissent,
protest or otherwise contest the same, except in the case of fraud or bad
faith by the Sellers' Representative. Neither the Sellers' Representative nor
any agent employed by Sellers' Representative shall incur any liability to any
Represented Party relating to the performance of its duties hereunder except
for actions or omissions by the Sellers' Representative or such agent
constituting fraud or bad faith. The Sellers' Representative shall not have by
reason of this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any
Represented Party, except in respect of amounts actually received on behalf of
any such Blocker Seller or any such Unitholder (other than any holder of
Blocker Units).

(c) The Represented Parties shall cooperate with the Sellers' Representative
and any accountants, attorneys or other agents whom the Sellers'
Representative may retain to assist in carrying out Sellers' Representative's
duties hereunder. The Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders (other than any
holder of Blocker Units) shall reimburse the Sellers' Representative for all
costs and expenses incurred, including professional fees, on a pro rata basis,
based on the amount each such Blocker Seller or each such Unitholder (other
than any holder of Blocker Units) would have borne of such costs and expenses
had such costs and expenses been deducted from the Aggregate Final
Consideration prior to such Aggregate Final Consideration being distributed
pursuant to the Distribution Waterfall.

(d) In the event that the Sellers' Representative becomes unable to perform
the Sellers' Representative's responsibilities or resigns from such position,
the Sellers' Representative shall select another representative to fill such
vacancy and such substituted representative shall (i) be deemed to be the
Sellers' Representative for all purposes of this Agreement and (ii) exercise
the rights and powers of, and be entitled to the indemnity, reimbursement and
other benefits of, the Sellers' Representative hereunder.

(e) The Sellers' Representative shall hold the Sellers' Representative Expense
Fund in trust to cover and reimburse the fees and expenses incurred by the
Sellers' Representative for its obligations in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Sellers' Representative shall
disperse to the Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units) and the
Blocker Sellers the remaining balance of the Sellers' Representative Expense
Fund in accordance with the Distribution Waterfall, as and when determined by
the Sellers' Representative in its sole discretion.

(f) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Barteca Entities and
the Sellers' Representative (and its Affiliates) have retained each of
Kirkland and Ellis LLP, Halloran and Sage LLP, Berdon, Young and Margolis, PC and
FordHarrison LLP ("Sellers' Counsel") to act as their counsel in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby and that Sellers' Counsel has not
acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. The Parties hereby agree that, in the event that a
dispute arises between Purchaser, any of the Blockers, the Company or any of
their respective Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Sellers' Representative
or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand, Sellers' Counsel may represent
the Sellers' Representative or any of its Affiliates in such dispute even
though the interests of the Sellers' Representative or any of its Affiliates
may be directly adverse to Purchaser, any Barteca Entity, any of the Blockers
or any of their respective Affiliates and even though Sellers' Counsel may
have represented any Blocker or any Barteca Entity in a matter substantially
related to such dispute, and each of Purchaser, the Blockers and the Company
hereby waive on behalf of itself and their respective Affiliates, any conflict
of interest in connection with such representation by Sellers' Counsel. Each
of Purchaser and the Company further agrees that, as to all communications
among Sellers' Counsel, any Barteca Entity, and any Blocker Seller or any
Unitholder prior to the Closing that relate in any way to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege, the expectation
of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong
to the Sellers' Representative and its Affiliates, as applicable, and may be
controlled by the Sellers' Representative and its Affiliates and shall not
pass to or be claimed by Purchaser, the Barteca Entities or any of their
respective Affiliates; provided, however, that (i) in the event that, after
the Closing, a dispute arises between Purchaser or any Barteca Entity, on the
one hand, and a third party other than the Sellers' Representative, a RCP
Party, a GA Party or a Unitholder, on the other hand, Purchaser or any Barteca
Entity may assert the attorney-client privilege or other applicable privilege
or protection to prevent disclosure of such communications to such third party
and (ii) in the event that, after the Closing, a dispute arises between
Purchaser or any Barteca Entity, on the one hand, and the Sellers'
Representative, a RCP Party, a GA Party or a Unitholder, on the other hand,
nothing in this Section 11.1(f) shall prohibit Purchaser or any Barteca Entity
from seeking proper discovery of any such communications or the Sellers'
Representative, a RCP Party, a GA Party or a Unitholder from asserting that
such communications are not discoverable to the extent that applicable
attorney-client privileges and working product protections have attached
thereto.

(g) Purchaser and Merger Sub may rely upon any decision, act, consent or
instruction of the Sellers' Representative as being the decision, act, consent
or instruction of each of the Blocker Sellers and the Unitholders (other than
any holder of Blocker Units). Each of Purchaser and Merger Sub is hereby
relieved from any Liability to any Person for any acts done by Purchaser or
Merger Sub in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Sellers' Representative.

(h) Notwithstanding the foregoing, effective from and after the Closing, (i)
the Sellers' Representative shall cease to be the Company's or any Blocker's
representative, true and lawful agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for any
purpose whatsoever and the Sellers' Representative's constitution and
appointment as such pursuant to Section 11.1(a) is hereby revoked and (ii)
none of the Company or any Blocker shall be bound by any action, decision or
omission of the Sellers' Representative, whether occurring prior to, at or
after the Closing.

11.2 Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may not be amended, altered or
modified except by a written instrument executed by Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative; provided that the Company may, with the prior written consent
of Purchaser (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), amend Exhibit I by providing such amendment in writing to the other
Parties (provided that any such amendment (a) is not inconsistent with the
terms of the Company LLC Agreement (including the terms thereof related to
distributions) and (b) is not inconsistent with the proviso of the definition
of Distribution Waterfall). No course of dealing between or among any Persons having any interest in this Agreement shall be
deemed effective to modify, amend or discharge any part of this Agreement or
any rights or obligations of any Person under or by reason of this Agreement.
No failure on the part of any Party to exercise any power, right, privilege or
remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any Party in
exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, shall
operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or remedy, and no single
or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege or remedy shall
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any other power, right,
privilege or remedy. No Party shall be deemed to have waived any Action
arising out of this Agreement, or any provision of this Agreement, or any
power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement, unless the waiver of
such Action, provision, power, right, privilege or remedy is expressly set
forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered on behalf of such
Party, and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have any effect except
in the specific instance in which it is given. No waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute, a waiver of
any other provisions, whether or not similar, nor shall any waiver constitute
a continuing waiver. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, this Section 11.2, Section 11.8, Section 11.13, Section 11.14(b) and
Section 11.16(b) may not be amended, modified, waived or terminated in a
manner adverse in any material respect to any Debt Financing Source without
the prior written consent of such Debt Financing Source.

11.3 Notices. All notices, requests and other communications hereunder must be
in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by hand
(with written confirmation of receipt by other than automatic means, whether
electronic or otherwise), (b) when sent by email (with written confirmation of
transmission) or (c) one (1) Business Day following the day sent by an

11.4 Assignment. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any
rights, benefits or obligations set forth herein may be assigned by any of the
Parties without the prior written consent of Purchaser and the Sellers'
Representative, any attempted assignment without such prior written consent
shall be void; provided that the rights of Purchaser may be assigned to the
Debt Financing Sources for collateral purposes.

11.5 Severability. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement shall
be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or
invalid under applicable Law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provision or the remaining provisions of this Agreement.

11.6 Construction and Interpretation. Where specific language is used to
clarify by example a general statement contained herein, such specific
language shall not be deemed to modify, limit or restrict in any manner the
construction of the general statement to which it relates. The language used
in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to
express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be
applied against any Party. Unless the context of this Agreement otherwise
requires, (a) words of any gender include each other gender, (b) words using
the singular or plural number also include the plural or singular number,
respectively, (c) the terms "hereof," "herein," "hereby" and derivative or
similar words refer to this entire Agreement, (d) the terms "Article,"
"Exhibit," "Schedule" or "Section" refer to the specified Article, Exhibit,
Schedule or Section of this Agreement and (c) the word "including" means
"including without limitation." The word "extent" in the phrase "to the
extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such
phrase shall not mean simply "if." When calculating the period of time before
which, within which or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, (i) the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period shall be excluded and (ii) if the last day of such
period is a not a Business Day, the period in question shall end on the next
succeeding Business Day. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, any

modified or supplemented prior to the Closing Date, unless otherwise
specifically indicated, and any Law defined or referred to herein means such
Law as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented prior to the date
hereof, unless otherwise specifically indicated. References to a person are
also to its successors and permitted assigns. A document or information shall
be deemed to have been "made available" or otherwise delivered or provided to
Purchaser or its Representatives only if, prior to the date hereof, such
document or information has been posted to the Dataroom in a folder thereof to
which Purchaser or its Representatives have downloading and printing access.
All references to time in this Agreement shall be deemed to be New York City
time unless otherwise expressly specified.

11.7 Captions; etc. The captions, headings and table of contents used in this
Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not be deemed to
limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this Agreement, and
all provisions of this Agreement shall be enforced and construed as if no
caption had been used in this Agreement. 11.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except for (a) Section 7.4, which is
intended to be for the benefit of the DandO Indemnified Parties, and (b) after
the Closing, Section 1.6(a), which is intended to be for the benefit of the
Unitholders (other than any holder of Blocker Units), nothing herein expressed
or implied is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or give to any
third party, other than the Parties and their respective permitted successors
and assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement,
except that the provisions of Section 11.2, this Section 11.8, Section 11.13,
Section 11.14(b) and Section 11.16(b) shall also be for the benefit of the
Debt Financing Sources.

11.9 Specific Performance; Damages. Each Party agrees that the other Parties
would suffer irreparable damage in the event that any of the covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement, in any other document contemplated
hereby, or in any certificate delivered hereunder or thereunder, were not
performed in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or were otherwise
breached and money damages or other legal remedies would not be an adequate
remedy for any such damage. Accordingly, the Parties acknowledge and hereby
agree that, at any time prior to the termination of this Agreement, in the
event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, the Parties shall
be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain any such
breaches or threatened breaches and to specifically enforce the terms and
provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or
to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations set forth in this
Agreement, in addition to any other remedy to which a Party may be entitled at
law or in equity (including the Sellers' Representative's or Purchaser's right
to terminate this Agreement if and as permitted pursuant to Section 9.1 and to
seek money damages if and as permitted by Section 9.2). Each Party hereby
agrees not to raise any objections to the availability of the equitable remedy
of specific performance to prevent or restrain breaches or threatened breaches
of this Agreement by such Party. Each Party hereby waives (a) the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any Law to
post a bond or other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.
