CANCELLATION OF COMPANY  SHARES IN THE MERGER   3.1 Merger Consideration;

------------------------------------------------------------------------- Merger. ------ 
(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Newco, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
holders of any outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company
(together with any associated Company Rights (as defined below), the "Company
Shares") or capital stock of Newco:   -2-    (i) Each Company Share,
together with any associated right to  purchase one common share (a "Company
Right"), issued pursuant to the  Rights Agreement, dated as of March 1, 2000,
by and between the Company and  First Union National Bank, as Rights Agent
(the "Company Rights  Agreement"), issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time  (other than (A) Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 3.8 below),  (B)Company Shares owned by Parent, Newco or any direct
or indirect wholly  ---  owned subsidiary of Parent (collectively, "Parent
Companies") and (C)  Company Shares owned by any of the Company\'s direct or
indirect wholly  owned subsidiaries or held in the treasury of the Company
("Treasury  Shares")) shall, by virtue of the Merger, be cancelled and
extinguished and  converted into the right to receive, the Parent Stock
Consideration or the  combination of Parent Stock Consideration and Cash
Consideration, without  any interest thereon, as specified in Section 3.3
hereof (the "Merger  Consideration").   (ii) For purposes hereof, the
following terms have the following  respective meanings:   "Cash
Consideration" means a per Company Share amount in cash equal to  $40.00.  
"Closing Market Price" shall be the volume weighted average of the per  share
sales price (excluding after-market trading) for Parent Stock,  calculated to
two decimal places, for the twenty (20) consecutive trading  days immediately
preceding the date which is two (2) business days before  the Effective Time,
as reported on the National Market System of the  National Association of
Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System  ("Nasdaq"), the foregoing
period of twenty (20) trading days being  hereinafter sometimes referred to
as the "Price Determination Period" (For  example, if December 31, 2001 were
to be the Effective Date, then the Price  Determination Period would be
November 28, 29 and 30 and December 3, 4, 5,  6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17,
18, 19, 20, 21, 24 and 26, 2001).   "Conversion Ratio" means (calculated to
the nearest 0.0001):   (a) 2.2222, if the Closing Market Price is less than
$18.00;   (b) $40.00 / the Closing Market Price, if the Closing Market Price
is equal to or greater than $18.00 and equal to or less than $30.00; or  
(c) 1.3333, if the Closing Market Price is greater than $30.00.  
"Outstanding Shares" means the aggregate number of Company Shares 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, but excluding Company 
Shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(d) which number will not be 
greater than the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding on  the
date of this Agreement (except for shares issuable upon exercise of  stock
options or on conversion of Company Preferred Stock outstanding on  the date
of this Agreement).   -3-    "Parent Rights" means rights to purchase
Junior Participating  Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A of Parent ("Series
A Preferred")  distributed to holders of Parent Stock pursuant to a Rights
Agreement dated  February 26, 2000, as amended, between Parent and Registrar
and Transfer  Company (the "Parent Rights Agreement").   "Parent Stock"
means the common stock, no par value, of Parent and  associated Parent
Rights. For clarification, each reference herein to  Parent Stock shall
include the associated Parent Rights.   "Parent Stock Consideration" means
that number of shares of Parent  Stock equal to one share multiplied by the
Conversion Ratio. In the event  that between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the issued  and outstanding shares of Parent Stock shall
have been affected or changed  into a different number of shares or a
different class of shares as a  result of a stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend, spin-off,  extraordinary dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, subdivision,  combination of shares or other similar
transaction, or there shall have  been a record date declared for any such
matter, the Parent Stock  Consideration shall be proportionately
adjusted.   (b) No fractional shares of Parent Stock shall be issued
pursuant to the Merger. If the Parent Stock Consideration to be issued to a
holder of Company Shares in the Merger is not otherwise a whole number of
shares, such number shall be rounded to the nearest whole number, with a
number equal to .5 being rounded up to the nearest whole number.   (c) Each
share of Parent Stock and any and all shares of Preferred Stock of Parent
outstanding immediately prior to the Merger shall remain issued and
outstanding.   (d) Any shares of Company Stock owned by the Parent Companies
and Treasury Shares shall be cancelled and retired at the Effective Time and
shall cease to exist and no Parent Stock or other consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.   (e) On or after the Effective Time,
holders of certificates representing Company Shares (the "Certificates")
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as
stockholders of the Company, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration for each Company Share held by them.   3.2 Election
Procedure. Each holder of Company Shares (other than holders 
------------------ of Company Shares to be cancelled as set forth in Section
3.1(d)) shall have the right to submit a request specifying either that such
holder\'s Company Shares shall be converted into the Parent Stock
Consideration, Cash Consideration or a combination of Cash Consideration and
Parent Stock Consideration, without interest, in the Merger in accordance
with the following procedure:   (a) Each holder of Parent Stock may specify
in a request made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.2
(herein called an "Election") to either: (i) convert each Company Share owned
by such holder into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration in
the Merger (a "Stock Election"); (ii) convert each Company Share owned by
such holder into   -4-   the right to receive the Cash Consideration in
the Merger (a "Cash Election"); or (iii) convert a portion of the Company
Shares owned by such holder into the right to receive the Cash Consideration
in the Merger, and a portion of the Company Shares owned by each such holder
into the right to receive the Parent Stock Consideration in the Merger (a
"Cash/Stock Election"). A Form of Election (as defined in (b) below) shall be
included with each copy of the Proxy Statement (as defined in Section 4.10)
mailed to shareholders of the Company in connection with the meeting of
shareholders called to consider the approval of this Agreement. Parent and
the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to mail or otherwise
make available the Form of Election to all persons who become holders of
Company Shares during the period between the record date for such shareholder
meeting and the Election Deadline (as defined in Section 3.2(d)).   (b)
Parent shall prepare a form (the "Form of Election"), which shall be in form
and substance acceptable to the Company, pursuant to which each holder
of Company Shares at the close of business on the Election Deadline may make
an Election and which shall be mailed to the Company\'s shareholders in
accordance with Section 3.2(a) so as to permit the Company\'s shareholders to
exercise their right to make an Election prior to the Election Deadline.  
(c) Holders of record of Company Shares who hold such shares as
nominees, trustees, or in other representative capacities may submit multiple
Forms of Election, provided that such representative certifies that each Form
of Election covers all Shares held by such representative for a particular
beneficial owner.   (d) Not later than the filing of the Joint Proxy
Statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") (as defined
below), as contemplated in Section 6.9 hereof, Parent shall appoint a bank
acceptable to the Company as the person to receive Forms of Election and to
act as exchange agent under this Agreement, which bank shall be acceptable to
the Company (the "Exchange Agent"). Any Company shareholder\'s Election shall
have been made properly only if the Exchange Agent shall have received, by
5:00 p.m. local time in the city in which the principal office of such
Exchange Agent is located, on the date of the Election Deadline, a Form of
Election properly completed and signed and accompanied by certificates for
the Company Shares to which such Form of Election relates (or by an
appropriate guarantee of delivery of such certificates, as set forth in such
Form of Election, from a member of any registered national securities
exchange or of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. or a
commercial bank or trust company in the United States provided such
certificates are in fact delivered to the Exchange Agent by the time required
in such guarantee of delivery). Failure to deliver Company Shares covered by
such a guarantee of delivery within the time set forth on such guarantee
shall be deemed to invalidate any otherwise properly made Election. As used
herein, "Election Deadline" means the date announced by Parent (which
date shall be agreed upon by the Company), as the last day on which Forms of
Election will be accepted; provided, that such date shall be a business day
no earlier than ten (10) business days prior to the Effective Time and no
later than the date on which the Effective Time occurs. In the event this
Agreement shall have been terminated prior to the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall immediately return all Election Forms and Certificates
for Company Shares to the appropriate Company shareholders.   -5-    (e)
Any Company shareholder may at any time prior to the Election Deadline change
his Election by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline accompanied by a revised Form of Election properly
completed and signed.   (f) Any Company shareholder may, at any time prior
to the Election Deadline, revoke his Election by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline or by withdrawal prior to
the Election Deadline of his certificates for Parent Stock, or of the
guarantee of delivery of such certificates, previously deposited with the
Exchange Agent. All Elections shall be revoked automatically if the Exchange
Agent is notified in writing by Parent or the Company that this Agreement has
been terminated. Any Company shareholder who shall have deposited
certificates for Company Shares with the Exchange Agent shall have the right
to withdraw such certificates by written notice received by the Exchange
Agent prior to the Election Deadline and thereby revoke his Election as of
the Election Deadline if the Merger shall not have been consummated prior
thereto.   (g) Parent shall have the right to make rules, not inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, governing the validity of the Forms of
Election, the manner and extent to which Elections are to be taken into
account in making the determinations prescribed by Section 3.3, the issuance
and delivery of certificates for Parent Stock into which Company Shares are
converted in the Merger and the payment of cash for Company Shares converted
into the right to receive the Cash Consideration in the Merger.   3.3
Conversion of Outstanding Shares Into Parent Stock Consideration and 
-------------------------------------------------------------------- Cash
Consideration; Proration. The manner in which each Company Share
(except ----------------------------- Company Shares to be cancelled as set
forth in Section 3.1(d)) shall be converted in the Merger into Parent Stock
Consideration, Cash Consideration or a combination of Parent Stock
Consideration and Cash Consideration shall be as set forth in this Section
3.3.   (a) As is more fully set forth below, the number of Company Shares
to be converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration in the Merger
pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed the product of (i) the number of
Outstanding Shares and (ii) the Maximum Cash Percentage. "Maximum Cash
Percentage" shall mean the excess of 58% over the percentage of Outstanding
Shares that are Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 3.8); provided,
however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in order
that the Merger will not fail to satisfy continuity of interest requirements
under applicable federal income tax principles relating to reorganizations
under Section 368(a) of the Code, the Maximum Cash Percentage shall be
reduced to the extent necessary to satisfy such requirements as reasonably
determined by Hunton and Williams, and consequently the number of Outstanding
Shares that will be converted into Parent Stock Consideration will be
increased and the number of Outstanding Shares that will be converted into
the right to receive Cash Consideration will be reduced.   (b) Each Company
Share that the holder has elected to have converted into Parent Stock
Consideration pursuant to a Stock Election or a Cash/Stock Election shall be
converted into Parent Stock Consideration.   -6-    (c) If Cash Elections
and Cash/Stock Elections request the conversion into Cash Consideration of a
number of Company Shares less than the number constituting the Maximum Cash
Percentage, each Company Share for which conversion into Cash Consideration
has been requested shall be converted into the right to receive Cash
Consideration.   (d) If Cash Elections and Cash/Stock Elections request the
conversion into Cash Consideration of a number of Company Shares more than
the number constituting the Maximum Cash Percentage, the Company Shares for
which conversion into Cash Consideration have been requested shall be
converted into the right to receive Cash Consideration and Parent Stock
Consideration in the following manner:   (i) Each Company Share that the
holder has requested be converted  into Cash Consideration pursuant to a
Cash/Stock Election requesting Cash  Consideration for a percentage of all of
the holder\'s Company Shares equal  to or less than the Maximum Cash
Percentage shall be converted into Cash  Consideration.   (ii) In the case
of each Cash/Stock Election not described in the  preceding clause (i) and
each Cash Election, the number of Company Shares  converted into the right to
receive Cash Consideration shall equal the  product of (A) the number of
Company Shares that the Election requests be  converted into Cash
Consideration and (B) a fraction, the numerator of  which will be the number
of Company Shares constituting the Remaining Cash  Percentage and the
denominator of which will be the aggregate number of  Company Shares
requested to be converted into Cash Consideration pursuant  to all Elections
subject to this clause (ii). "Remaining Cash Percentage"  shall mean the
excess of the Maximum Cash Percentage over the percentage of  Outstanding
Shares represented by the aggregate number of Company Shares to  be converted
into Cash Consideration pursuant to the preceding clause (i).   (iii) Each
Company Share covered by an Election described in the  preceding clause (ii)
and not converted into the right to receive Cash  Consideration pursuant to
such clause (ii) shall be converted in the Merger  into Parent Stock
Consideration.   (e) Each Non-Electing Company Share shall be converted in
the Merger into Parent Stock Consideration. "Non-Electing Company Share"
shall mean any Outstanding Share for which an Election is not in effect at
the Election Deadline. If Parent shall determine that any Election is not
properly made with respect to any Company Shares, such Election shall be
deemed to be not in effect, and the Company Shares covered by such Election
shall, for purposes hereof, be deemed to be Non-Electing Company Shares.
Parent and the Exchange Agent shall have no obligation to notify any person
of any defect in any Form of Election submitted to the Exchange Agent.  
(f) Subject to Section 3.3(a), the Exchange Agent shall make all computations
contemplated by this Section 3.3 and all such computations shall
be conclusive and binding on the holders of Company Shares absent manifest
error.   -7-    3.4 Issuance of Parent Stock Consideration. 
--------------------------------------   (a) Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to the Exchange Agent, in trust for the
benefit of the holders of Company Shares, certificates representing an
aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock as nearly as practicable equal to
the number of shares to be converted into Parent Stock as determined in
Section 3.3.   (b) As soon as practicable on the day of the Closing (but
after the Effective Time), each holder of Company Shares converted into
Parent Stock Consideration pursuant to Article III, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent with a properly completed Letter of Transmittal (to the extent
not previously surrendered with a Form of Election ) of one or more
Certificates for such Company Shares for cancellation, shall be entitled to
receive (and the Exchange Agent shall deliver) certificates representing the
number of shares of Parent Stock into which such Company Shares shall have
been converted in the Merger.   (c) No dividends or distributions that have
been declared, if any, will be paid to persons entitled to receive
certificates for shares of Parent Stock until such persons surrender their
Certificates at which time all such dividends and distributions shall be
paid. In no event shall the persons entitled to receive such dividends be
entitled to receive interest on such dividends. If any certificate for such
Parent Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the
Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer taxes or other taxes required by reason of
issuance in a name other than the registered holder of the certificate
surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any party hereto shall be
liable to a holder of Company Shares for any Parent Stock or dividends
thereon delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.   3.5 Payment of Cash Consideration.
Immediately prior to the Effective Time, 
----------------------------- Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent,
in trust for the benefit of the holders of Company Shares, an amount in cash
equal to the Cash Consideration to be paid to holders of Company Shares to be
converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration as determined in
Section 3.3. As soon as practicable on the day of the Closing (but after the
Effective Time), the Exchange Agent shall distribute to holders of Company
Shares converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration and
determined in accordance with Section 3.3, upon proper surrender to the
Exchange Agent (to the extent not previously surrendered with a Form of
Election) of one or more Certificates for such Company Shares
for cancellation, a bank check for an amount equal to the Cash Consideration
times the number of Company Shares so converted. In no event shall the holder
of any such surrendered certificates be entitled to receive interest on any
of the Cash Consideration to be received in the Merger. If such check is to
be issued in the name of a person other than the person in whose name the
Certificates surrendered for exchange therefor are registered, it shall be a
condition of the exchange that the person requesting such exchange shall pay
to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
issuance of such   -8-   check to a person other than the registered
holder of the certificates surrendered, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Exchange Agent nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of Company Shares for any amount
paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar law.   3.6 Letters of Transmittal. Parent will instruct
the Exchange Agent to mail  ---------------------- to each holder of record
of Certificates who has not previously surrendered such holder\'s
Certificates with a validly executed Form of Election as soon as reasonably
practical after the Effective Time, (i) a Letter of Transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such
holder\'s Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as shall be agreed upon by the Company prior to the
Effective Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration (the "Letter of
Transmittal").   3.7 Missing Certificates.  --------------------   (a) If
any holder of Company Shares convertible into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration is unable to deliver the certificate which represents such
shares, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to such holder the Merger
Consideration to which the holder is entitled for such shares
upon presentation of the following:   (i) evidence to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that any  such certificate has been lost, wrongfully
taken or destroyed;   (ii) such security or indemnity as may be reasonably
requested  by the Parent to indemnify and hold harmless Parent and the
Exchange Agent;  and   (iii) evidence satisfactory to Parent that such
person is the  owner of the shares theretofore represented by each
certificate claimed to be  lost, wrongfully taken or destroyed and that the
holder is the person who  would be entitled to present such certificate for
payment pursuant to this  Agreement.   (b) Parent shall receive any
remaining Cash Consideration and Parent Stock Consideration on deposit with
the Exchange Agent on the date which is one year after the Effective Date and
any shareholder of the Company who does not hold Dissenting Shares who has
not surrendered his certificate(s) to the Exchange Agent prior to such time
shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration without interest upon
the surrender of such certificate(s) to Parent, subject to applicable escheat
or abandoned property laws.   3.8 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the  ----------------- contrary, Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has demanded payment for such shares in accordance
with Sections 1571 to 1580 of the PBCL, if such Sections provide for
dissenters\' rights for such Company Shares in the Merger ("Dissenting
Shares"),   -9-   shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as provided in Section 3.1, unless and until such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his or her right to dissent
and demand payment under the PBCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect or withdraws or loses his or her right to demand
payment, then such Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they
had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, if any, to which such holder is entitled, without
interest or dividends thereon, and such Company Shares shall no longer be
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for payment of Dissenting Shares and, prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall have the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent
of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle,
any such demands.   3.9 No Further Rights or Transfers; Cancellation of
Treasury Shares. Except 
--------------------------------------------------------------- for the
surrender of the certificate(s) representing the Company Shares in exchange
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each Share
or the perfection of dissenters\' rights with respect to the
Dissenting Shares, at and after the Effective Time, each holder of Company
Shares shall cease to have any rights as a shareholder of the Company, and no
transfer of Company Shares shall thereafter be made on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. Each Share held in the Company\'s
treasury immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the
Merger, be canceled and retired and cease to exist without any conversion
thereof.   3.10 Stock Options. At the Effective Time, each option or other
right to  ------------- purchase shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
stock options (a "Company Option"), whether granted by the Company under the
1999 Stock Option Plan (the "Company Option Plan") or any other plan or
agreement, which is outstanding at the Effective Time, whether or not
exercisable, shall be converted into options and become rights with respect
to Parent Stock ("Parent Options"), and the Company Option Plan or any such
other plan or agreement which is outstanding at the Effective Time shall be
terminated, and Parent shall assume each Option, in accordance with the terms
of the Option Plan and stock option agreement by which it is evidenced,
except that from and after the Effective Time, (i) Parent and its
Compensation Committee shall be substituted for the Company and the Committee
of the Company\'s Board of Directors (including, if applicable, the entire
Board of Directors of the Company) administering such Option Plan, (ii) each
Option assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Stock,
(iii) the number of shares of Parent Stock subject to such Option shall be
equal to the number of Company Shares subject to such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Conversion Ratio,
(iv) the per share exercise price under each such Option shall be adjusted by
dividing the per share exercise price under each such Option by the
Conversion Ratio and rounding up any fraction of a cent to the nearest cent
and (v) all Parent Options issuable pursuant to this Section 3.10 shall be
fully exercisable to the extent set forth in the applicable Company Option or
Company Option Plan or as stipulated by the Company\'s Board of Directors
pursuant to the applicable Company Option Plan. Notwithstanding the
provisions of clause (iii) of the preceding sentence, Parent shall not be
obligated to issue any fraction of a share of Parent Stock upon exercise of a
Parent Option and any fraction of a share   -10-   of Parent Stock that
otherwise would be subject to a Parent Option shall represent the right to
receive a cash payment upon exercise of such Parent Option equal to the
product of such fraction and the difference between the market value of one
share of Parent Stock at the time of exercise and the per share exercise
price of such Option. The market value of one share of Parent Stock at the
time of exercise of a Parent Option shall be the closing price of such common
stock on the Nasdaq (as reported by The Wall Street Journal or, if 
----------------------- not reported thereby, any other authoritative source
selected by Parent) on the last trading day preceding the date of exercise.
Each of the Company and Parent agrees to take all necessary steps to
effectuate the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.10, including using its
reasonable efforts to obtain from each holder of an Option any consent or
contract that may be deemed necessary or advisable in order to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 3.10   3.11 Certain Company
Actions. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company 
----------------------- shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Company Shares (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Shares) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
Article III of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), with respect to the Company to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act, such steps to be
taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued
by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.   3.12 Withholding.
The Exchange Agent or Parent shall be entitled to deduct  ----------- and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Company Shares such amounts as the Exchange Agent,
Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the Code or any
provisions of state, local or foreign tax law. Any amounts so withheld shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Company Shares in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.   ARTICLE IV. -- REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE

terms of all Company Benefit Plans that are intended to be "qualified" within

(including, without limitation, any liability to or under any such plan or
under any indemnity agreement to which the Company or any Company ERISA
Affiliate is a party), which liability, excluding liability for benefit
claims and funding obligations, each payable in the ordinary course, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. No
claim, action or litigation has been made, commenced or, to the knowledge of

(other than for benefits in the ordinary course) that could reasonably be

"rabbi trust" or similar arrangement, or (B) any benefit under any Company
Benefit Plan being established or increased, or becoming accelerated, vested
or payable.   (h) Except as described on Schedule 4.10, neither the Company
nor any entity that was at any time during the six-year period ending on the
date of this Agreement a Company   -19-   ERISA Affiliate has ever
maintained, had an obligation to contribute to, contributed to, or had any
liability with respect to any plan that (A) is or was a pension plan (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) that is or was subject to Title IV of
ERISA, Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or (B) that is or was
a multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 414(f) of the Code or Sections
3(37) or 4001(a)(31) of ERISA). With respect to each Company Benefit Plan
subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA, (i) each
such Company Benefit Plan uses a funding method permissible under the Code
and ERISA and the actuarial assumptions used in connection therewith are
reasonable individually and in the aggregate, (ii) no such Company Benefit

unfunded benefit liabilities" as defined in Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA is

filing of a notice of intent to terminate such Company Benefit Plan has been
made, and the PBGC has not initiated any proceeding to terminate any such
Company Benefit Plan. To the knowledge of the Company, no event has occurred
and there exists no condition or set of circumstances which presents a
material risk that any Company Benefit Plan has or is likely to experience a

offer to sell directly or indirectly any shares of Parent Common Stock or any
options rights or other securities convertible into shares of Parent Common

Effective Time (unless the Company shall otherwise agree in writing and
except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement), Parent will, and will

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and except as otherwise
permitted in this Agreement, as set forth in Schedule 6.2 or as set forth in

standards of the Nasdaq, including, without limitation, (A)  entering into an
agreement to effect, or effecting, a Change in Control  with respect to
Parent, (B) altering through merger, liquidation,  reorganization,

any representation  warranty or covenant hereunder.   (b) In addition,
during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Effective
Time:   -39-    (i) Parent shall not amend the Financing Letter in any 
material respect and shall use its best efforts to do or cause to be done 
all things necessary or appropriate on its part in order to fulfill the 
conditions precedent set forth in the Financing Letter and to consummate  the
transactions contemplated by such Financing Letter; or   (ii) Neither Parent
nor any Subsidiary, nor any  executive officer or director of Parent or any
Subsidiary, nor any  shareholder of Parent who may be deemed to be an
"affiliate" (as that term  is defined for purposes of Rules 145 and 405
promulgated by the SEC under  the Securities Act) of Parent shall purchase or
sell on Nasdaq, or submit a  bid to purchase or an offer to sell on Nasdaq,
directly or indirectly, any  shares of Parent Common Stock or any options,
rights or other securities  convertible into shares of Parent Common Stock
during the Price  Determination Period.   6.3 No Solicitation of
Transactions.  -------------------------------   (a) The Company agrees
that, as of the date of this Agreement, it has, and has caused each officer,
director or employee of, or any investment banker, attorney or other advisor
or representative of the Company or any subsidiary (the "Company
Representatives"), to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any Third Party (as
defined below) conducted heretofore with respect to any Competing Transaction
(as defined below). The Company shall not, nor shall it permit any of its
Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any Company Representatives
to (i) solicit or initiate, encourage, or facilitate, directly or indirectly,
any inquiries relating to, or the submission of, any proposal or offer,
whether in writing or otherwise, from any person other than Parent, Newco or
any affiliates thereof (a "Third Party") to acquire beneficial ownership
(as defined under Rule 13(d) of the Exchange Act) of all or more than 5% of
the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 5% or
more of any class of equity securities of the Company pursuant to a
merger, consolidation or other business combination, sale of shares of stock,
sale of assets, tender offer, exchange offer or similar transaction or series
of related transactions, which is structured to permit such Third Party to
acquire beneficial ownership of more than 5% of the assets of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 5% or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company (a "Competing Transaction"); (ii) participate in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any person any
information or data with respect to or access to the properties of, or take
any other action to knowingly facilitate the making of any proposal that
constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Competing
Transaction; or waive the provisions of any "standstill" or similar agreement
or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any Competing Transaction,
approve or recommend or resolve to approve or recommend any Competing
Transaction or enter into any agreement requiring it to abandon, terminate or
fail to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.   Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if the Company receives
a bona fide, unsolicited, written proposal or offer for a Competing
Transaction by a Third Party, which the Board of Directors determines in good
faith (after consulting the Board of Directors\' independent financial
advisor) (A) will result in terms which are more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Company Shares than the Merger and the other
transactions   -40-   contemplated by this Agreement and, after
consultation with counsel, determines that failure to take such action may
result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable laws; and (B) is
reasonably capable of being consummated (provided that the Company, including
the Board of Directors, and any of its advisors shall be permitted to contact
such Third Party and its advisors solely for the purpose of clarifying the
proposal and any material contingencies and the capability of consummation)
and (C) is subject to a confidentiality agreement with such Third Party on
terms no less favorable to the Company, in all material respects, than the
confidentiality agreement with Parent (each if amended or restated a
"Superior Competing Transaction"), then the Company may, in response to an
unsolicited request therefor and subject to compliance with Section 6.2(b),
furnish information with respect to the Company and its subsidiaries to and
participate in discussions and negotiations directly or through its
representatives with, such Third Party, provided that the Company shall have
delivered to Parent prior written notice that it intends to take
such action.   The Board of Directors of the Company shall be permitted
to withhold, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent, its
recommendation to the holders of the Company Shares, but only if (i) such
Third Party submits an unsolicited Competing Transaction that the Board of
Directors believes, in its good faith judgment, is reasonably likely to
result in a Superior Competing Transaction and after consultation with
counsel, determines that failure to take such action may result in a breach
of fiduciary duties under applicable law and (ii) the Company shall have
delivered to Parent prior written notice that it intends to take such action,
including therein the identity of such Third Party and the terms and
conditions of such Superior Competing Transaction. The Company, its officers,
directors, advisors, and representatives shall immediately cease all
activities, discussions and negotiations, if any, with any person conducted
prior to the date hereof. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent
the Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Exchange Act.   (b) The Company shall promptly advise
Parent orally and in writing of (i) any Competing Transaction or any inquiry
with respect to or which could reasonably be expected to lead to any
Competing Transaction received by any officer or director of the Company or,
to the knowledge of the Company, any financial advisor, attorney or other
advisor or representative of the Company; (ii) the identity of the Third
Party submitting such Competing Transactions or making such inquiry, and
(iii) the material terms and conditions of such Competing Transaction. The
Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status
and details of any such Competing Transaction (including amendments and
proposed amendments) proposal or inquiry in a timely manner.   6.4
Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and conditions herein 
------------------ provided, each of the parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using its reasonable efforts to
obtain all necessary or appropriate waivers, consents and approvals, to
effect all necessary registrations, filings and submissions (including, but
not limited to, (i) filings under the HSR Act and any other submissions
requested by the PPUC, VSCC, FCC, Federal Trade Commission or Department of
Justice and (ii) such filings, consents,   -41-   approvals, orders
registrations and declarations as may be required under the laws of any
foreign country in which the Company or any of its subsidiaries conducts any
business or owns any assets) and to lift any injunction or other legal bar to
the Merger (and, in such case, to proceed with the Merger as expeditiously as
possible), subject, however, to the requisite votes of the shareholders of
any or all of the Company, Newco and Parent.   (a) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to use its reasonable efforts
or take any action pursuant to this Section 6.4 if in the good faith opinion
of the Board of Directors in accordance with Section 6.3(a) after
consultation with its counsel such actions might be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable law.   6.5
Access to Information. Upon reasonable notice, each party shall (and 
--------------------- shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) afford to
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives of such party ("Representatives"), in order to evaluate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, reasonable access, during normal
business hours and upon reasonable notice throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its properties, books and records and, during such period,
shall (and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to) furnish or make available
reasonably promptly to such Representatives all information concerning its
business, properties and personnel as may reasonably be requested. Each party
agrees that it will not, and will cause its Representatives not to, use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 6.5 for any purpose unrelated
to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
confidentiality agreements, dated May 2, 2001 and June 20, 2001, respectively
(the "Confidentiality Agreements"), by and between the Company and Parent
shall apply with respect to information furnished by each party, its
subsidiaries and its Representatives to the other hereunder.   6.6
Publicity. The parties will consult with each other and will mutually 
--------- agree upon any press releases or public announcements pertaining to
the Merger and shall not issue any such press releases or make any such
public announcements prior to such consultation and agreement, except as may
be required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any agreement
with any national securities exchange or automated quotation system, in which
case the party proposing to issue such press release or make such public
announcement shall consult in good faith with the other party before issuing
any such press releases or making any such public announcements.   6.7
Indemnification of Directors and Officers. 
-----------------------------------------   (a) In the event of any
threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative, including, without
limitation, any such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation
in which any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date
hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company
(the "Indemnified Parties") is, or is threatened to be, made a party based in
whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to
(i) the fact that he is or was a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or
agent of the Company or any subsidiary of   -42-   the Company, or is or
was serving at the request of the Company or any subsidiary of the Company as
a director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (ii) the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising
before or after the Effective Time, the parties hereto agree to cooperate and
use their commercially reasonable efforts to defend against and respond
thereto. It is understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and
hold harmless, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall, indemnify and hold
harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened
or actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in
the event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, demand,
proceeding or investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the
Effective Time), (A) the Company, and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving Corporation shall,
promptly pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the full extent
permitted by law, subject to the provision by such Indemnified Party of an
undertaking to reimburse the amounts so advanced in the event of a final non-
appealable determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Party is not entitled to such amounts, (B) the Indemnified
Parties may retain one counsel satisfactory to them (except in case of a
conflict of interest among two or more Indemnified Parties, in which case
more than one counsel may be retained), and the Company, and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and
the Surviving Corporation shall, pay all reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within 30 days after statements
therefor are received and (C) the Company and the Surviving Corporation will,
and Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to, use their commercially
reasonable efforts to assist in the defense of any such matter; provided that
neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further, that the Surviving
Corporation shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when
and if, but only to the extent that, a court of competent jurisdiction shall
ultimately determine, and such determination shall have become final and non-
appealable, that indemnification of such Indemnified Party in the manner
contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable law. Any Indemnified Party
wishing to claim indemnification under this Section 6.6, upon learning of any
such claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, shall notify
the Company and, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
thereof, provided, that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Company and the Surviving Corporation except to the extent
such failure to notify materially prejudices such party.   (b) Parent and
Newco agree that all rights to indemnification existing in favor of, and all
exculpations and limitations of the personal liability of, the directors,
officers, employees and agents of the Company and the subsidiaries of the
Company in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in
effect as of the date hereof with respect to matters occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time, including the Merger, shall continue in full force and
effect for a period of not less than six years from the Effective Time;
provided, however, that all rights to   -43-   indemnification in respect
of any claims (each, a "Claim") asserted or made within such period shall
continue until the disposition of such Claim. For a period of six years after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, cause to be maintained in effect the existing
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
policies with an amount of coverage not less than 100% of the amount of
existing coverage, or policies that are no less favorable to the
Indemnified Parties, and with an amount of coverage not less than 100% of the
amount of existing coverage, than the policies which are currently maintained
by the Company, with respect to claims arising from facts or events which
occurred at or before the Effective Time, so long as such policies are
available for an annual premium which is no more than 200% of the current
annual premium for the existing policies; provided, that if such policies are
not available for an annual premium of no more than 200% of the current
annual premium, then policies in an amount and scope as great as can be
obtained for an annual premium of 200% of the current annual premium shall be
obtained.   (c) This Section 6.7 is intended for the irrevocable benefit
of, and to grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all successors and assigns of Parent, the Company and the
Surviving Corporation. Each of the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
enforce the covenants contained in this Section 6.7.   (d) In the event
that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person or entity and shall not be
the continuing or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys a majority of its properties and assets to any person or
entity, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors, assigns and transferees of the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7.   (e) To
the extent permitted by law, all rights of indemnification for the benefit of
any Indemnified Party shall be mandatory rather than permissive.   6.8
Employees.  ---------   (a) Following the Effective Time, (i) Parent shall
cause Newco and its successors: (A) to satisfy each of the agreements and
arrangements (the "Employment Obligations") described in subsection (c) below
with respect to the employees (the "Contract Employees") subject to such
agreements and arrangements, (B) use its commercially reasonable efforts to
retain each present full-time employee of the Company at such employee\'s
current position with such current responsibilities(or, if offered to, and
accepted by, an employee, a position for which the employee is qualified with
Newco or Parent at a salary commensurate with the position), (C) pay
compensation to each person who was employed as of the Effective Time and who
continues to be employed by Newco or Parent on and after the Effective Time,
that is at least equal to the aggregate compensation that such person was
receiving from the Company prior to the Effective Time (unless there is a
material change in the duties and responsibilities of such employee), (ii) in
the event that Parent causes Parent or Newco to continue to employ officers
or employees of the Company as of the Effective Time, Newco or Parent or
their successors shall employ such persons on the Effective Time who are not
Contract Employees as "at will" employees, (iii) officers and employees of
the Company who continue   -44-   employment with Newco or Parent or
their successors after the Effective Time and who are Contract Employees will
be employed pursuant to the terms and conditions of their respective
Employment Obligations, and (iv) in the event Newco or Parent or their
successors do not employ, or terminate the employment (other than as a result
of unsatisfactory performance of their respective duties or for cause) of any
officers or employees of the Company as of the Effective Time who are not
Contract Employees, Parent shall cause Parent or Newco or their successors to
pay the following severance benefits to such employees: a minimum of 2
weeks\' salary, with an additional one week for each year of service, with
a maximum of 26 weeks\' salary.   (b) Except as set forth on Schedule
6.8(b), for a period of two  --------------- (2) years following the
Effective Time, Parent agrees to provide employee benefit plans, programs,
arrangements and policies for the benefit of employees and retired employees
of the Company and its subsidiaries that in the aggregate are no less
favorable to such employees and retired employees than the Company Plans. In
the case of benefit plans and programs under which benefits are paid or
determined by reference to the value of Company Shares, Parent agrees
that such benefits shall be paid or determined by reference to the value of
shares of common stock of Parent in an equitable manner. All service credited
to each employee and retired employee by the Company through the Effective
Time shall be recognized by Parent for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under the Parent Benefit Plans. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent shall
not treat any Company employee as a "new" employee or retired employee for
purposes of any pre-existing condition exclusions, waiting periods, evidence
of insurability requirements or similar provision under any health or other
welfare plan, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to make
appropriate arrangements with its insurance carrier(s), to the extent
applicable, to ensure such result.   (c) Parent and the Surviving
Corporation hereby agree to honor (without modification) and assume the
employment agreements, executive termination agreements and individual
benefit arrangements listed on Schedule  -------- 6.8(c)(except to the
extent that such agreements have been waived prior to the ------ Effective
Time), all as in effect at the Effective Time.   6.9 Registration Statement;
Joint Proxy Statement.  ---------------------------------------------   (a)
As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, (i) Parent
and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a Joint Proxy Statement,
and (ii) Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-4 (together with all amendments thereto, the "Registration
Statement") in which the Joint Proxy Statement shall be included as a
prospectus in connection with the registration under the Securities Act
of the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued to the shareholders of
the Company pursuant to the Merger. Parent and the Company shall each use
all commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to
become effective as promptly as practicable, and, prior to the effective date
of the Registration Statement, Parent shall take all or any action required
under any applicable federal or state securities laws in connection with the
issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. In
connection with the preparation of the Registration Statement and Joint Proxy
Statement, the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company
as Parent may reasonably request, and Parent shall furnish all information
concerning   -45-   Parent as the Company may reasonably request. As
promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement shall have become
effective, each of Parent and the Company shall mail the Joint Proxy
Statement to its respective shareholders.   (b) Subject to Section 6.3, the
Joint Proxy Statement shall include the unanimous recommendation of the Board
of Directors of the Company to the shareholders of the Company in favor of
Company Shareholder Approval; notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company may withhold, withdraw,
modify or amend its recommendation if in the good faith opinion of the Board
of Directors, arrived at in accordance with the provisions of Section 6.3(a),
after consultation with counsel, such recommendation might be inconsistent
with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s shareholders under applicable
law; and any such withholding, withdrawal, modification or amendment shall
not constitute a breach of this Agreement.   (c) The Joint Proxy Statement
shall include the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of
Parent to the shareholders of Parent in favor of Parent Shareholder
Approval.   (d) Except as may be required by law, no amendment or supplement
to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement will be made by
Parent or the Company without the approval of the other party, which will not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Parent and the Company each will advise
the other, promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when
the Registration Statement has become effective or any supplement or
amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop order, the suspension of
the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable in connection with the
Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, any request by the SEC for
amendment of the Joint Proxy Statement or the Registration Statement or
comments thereon or requests for additional information by the SEC.   (e)
Parent shall promptly prepare and submit to the Nasdaq a listing application
covering the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, and shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, prior to the Effective Time of
the Merger, approval for the listing of such Parent Common Stock, subject to
official notice of issuance, and the Company shall cooperate with Parent with
respect to such listing.   6.10 Shareholders\' Approvals. 
-----------------------   (a) The Company, acting through its Board of
Directors, shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
PBCL, any other applicable law and its Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws,
promptly and duly call, give notice of, and convene and hold as soon as
practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement becomes
effective the meeting of the Company\'s shareholders (the "Company
Shareholders Meeting") for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval.   (b) Parent, acting through its Board of Directors, shall,

practicable following the date upon which the Registration Statement
becomes effective the meeting of Parent\'s shareholders (the "Parent
Shareholders Meeting", together with any Company Shareholders Meeting, the
"Shareholders Meetings") for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder
Approval.   (c) Parent and the Company shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to solicit from their respective shareholders proxies in favor of
such approvals, and shall take all other action necessary or advisable to
secure the vote or consent of shareholders required by the PBCL, VSCA or the
Nasdaq, as applicable, to obtain such approvals, in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement unless, in the good faith opinion of the
Company\'s Board of Directors, arrived at in accordance with the provisions
of Section 6.3(a), after consultation with its counsel, obtaining such
approvals might be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company\'s
shareholders under applicable law.   6.11 Reorganization Treatment. Each of
Parent, Newco and the Company shall  ------------------------ use its
reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code for federal
income Tax purposes, including, without limitation, providing reasonable
representations requested by counsel in connection with the tax opinions to
be provided by counsel pursuant to Sections 7.1(h). Unless otherwise required
by law, each party shall (i) report the Merger on all Tax Returns and other
filings as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code
and (ii) not take any position or action that is inconsistent with the
characterization of the Merger as such a reorganization in any audit,
administrative proceeding, litigation or otherwise.   ARTICLE VII. --
