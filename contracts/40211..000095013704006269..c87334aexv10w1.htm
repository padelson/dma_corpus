Section 2.6; provided, that the Purchase Price shall not be adjusted unless
the decision of the Arbitrating Accounting Firm would result in an adjustment

least Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) (such that, if the Purchase Price,
as determined by the Arbitrating Accounting Firm, is not at least Fifty
Thousand Dollars ($50,000) different from the Purchase Price shown on the
Closing Balance Sheet submitted by GTS, then the Purchase Price as determined
based on the Closing Balance Sheet submitted by GTS shall be the final and
binding "Purchase Price" for purposes of this Section 2.6. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if Purchasers deliver a written notice that Purchasers intend
to dispute the Closing Balance Sheet delivered by Sellers, any amount not
in dispute shall be paid as contemplated by Section 2.6(a). If Purchasers
deliver written notice that Purchasers do not intend to dispute the Closing
Balance Sheet delivered by Sellers, then such Closing Balance Sheet shall be
final and binding upon the parties upon delivery of such notice, and if
Purchasers do not notify Sellers of a dispute prior to the termination of the
30 day period specified above in Section 2.6(b), then the Closing Balance
Sheet as delivered by Sellers shall be final and binding upon the parties

Accounting Firm shall be borne equally by Purchasers and Sellers.

Immediately after execution of this Agreement and prior to and after the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its commercially reasonable efforts (at its own cost and expense, except as specifically provided in this Section 5.1(d)) to obtain, and Purchasers shall consult and cooperate with Sellers    ##### 

  

    

in Sellers obtaining, all consents and waivers from third parties to
the extent such consents or waivers are required in respect of any Contracts
with Sellers, including in respect of any Equipment Leases and Financing
Agreements, in connection with entering into this Agreement or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "Required
Consents"); provided, that, except as specifically provided in this Section
5.1(d), neither party hereto shall be required to pay or commit to pay any
amount to (or incur any obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any such
Required Consent may be required. Purchasers acknowledge that Required
Consents may be required from parties to Contracts listed on Schedule 3.4,
including parties to Equipment Leases and Financing Agreements, and that all
such Required Consents have not been obtained and may not be obtained. Other
than in connection with a breach of this Section 5.1(d) or as provided in the

Consent is required under a Contract listed on Schedule 3.4 but is
not obtained prior to the Closing or if an attempted assignment of a Contract

"Unassigned Contract"), then after the Closing, except for the Recourse Debt
as is provided in clause (v) below, the applicable Seller shall continue to
use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, and Purchasers shall
continue to consult with and cooperate with Sellers in obtaining, such
Required Consent or otherwise procure an effective assignment of such
Unassigned Contract. With respect to Unassigned Contracts (other than the
Equipment Leases, the Financing Agreements and the Recourse Debt), pending
the obtaining of such Required Consent or the procurement of such assignment,
the applicable Seller shall implement an arrangement reasonably satisfactory
to the applicable Purchaser to provide such Purchaser with the rights and
benefits of such Unassigned Contract (including an arrangement to provide the
applicable Purchaser with the amounts collected under such Unassigned
Contract) so long as such Purchaser, at its sole cost and expense, accepts
the burdens and performs the obligations under such Unassigned Contract as a
subcontractor of the applicable Seller. If, with respect to any such
Unassigned Contract, including the Equipment Leases (and the interests in
Equipment related thereto) and the Financing Agreements, the applicable
Required Consent is obtained or an effective assignment
reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Purchaser can otherwise be made
following the Closing, the applicable Seller shall as soon as reasonably
practicable assign to the applicable Purchaser all of its right, title and
interest in and to such Unassigned Contract, and the applicable Purchaser
shall assume and perform all liabilities and the obligations arising
thereunder after the date of such Required Consent, at which time such
Unassigned Contract (and the interests in Equipment related thereto) shall be
deemed a Transferred Asset, without the payment of further consideration
(except for the amounts set forth in Sections 2.5 and 2.7, if applicable) and
the obligations so assumed thereunder shall be deemed Assumed
Obligations.   

 (ii) Equipment Leases. Immediately after execution of this Agreement and prior to and after the Closing, each Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use its    ##### 

  

    

commercially reasonable efforts (at its own cost and expense) to obtain, and
Purchasers shall consult and cooperate with Sellers in Sellers obtaining, all

the Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any of the foregoing, shall
be as set forth in Article 8, Article 9 and Article 10\. To the extent that
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties have any Losses for which they may assert
any other right to indemnification, contribution or recovery from Sellers or
GFC (whether under this Agreement or under any common law or any statute,
including any Environmental Law, or otherwise), Purchasers hereby waive,
release and agree not to assert such other right, and Purchasers agree to
cause each of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties to waive, release and
agree not to assert such right.   

 (d) The sole and exclusive liability and responsibility of Purchasers to the Seller Indemnified Parties under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, other than the Transition Services Agreement and the Equipment Lease Subservicing Agreement (including for any breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty or for any breach of any covenant or obligation), and the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to any of the foregoing, shall be as set forth in Article 8, Article 9 and Article 10\.

 9.5 Claims. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after knowledge of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement that does not involve a third party claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding of the type described in Section 9.6, becomes within Purchasers knowledge or Sellers knowledge, as the case may be, the Indemnified Person shall give written notice to the Indemnifying Person of such claim, which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such claim and the estimated amount (if then susceptible to estimation) that the Indemnified Person at the time plans to seek hereunder from the Indemnifying Person, together with such reasonably available information (if not already available to the Indemnifying Person) as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person to determine that the limitations in Section 9.4 have been satisfied or do not apply; provided, that failure of the Indemnified Person to give such notice of any such claim shall not release, waive or otherwise affect the obligations under this Article 9 of the Indemnifying Person with respect thereto except to the extent that it is materially prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice.   

 9.6 Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified Person shall give written notice (the "Initial Notice") as promptly as is reasonably practicable, but in any event no later than ten Business Days after receiving notice thereof, to the Indemnifying Person of the written assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto in respect of which indemnity is to be sought under this Agreement (which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such claim and the estimated    ##### 

  

    

amount (if then susceptible to estimation) that the Indemnified Person
at that time plans to seek hereunder from the Indemnifying Person, together
with such reasonably available information (if not already available to
the Indemnifying Person) as may be necessary for the Indemnifying Person
to determine that the limitations in Section 9.4 have been satisfied or do
not apply); provided, that failure of the Indemnified Person to give such
notice of any such claim or commencement shall not release, waive or
otherwise affect the obligations under this Article 9 of the Indemnifying
Person with respect thereto except to the extent that it is materially
prejudiced by the failure or delay in giving such notice. The Indemnifying
Person may, at its own expense, (a) participate in the defense of any such
claim, suit, action or proceeding and (b) upon notice to the Indemnified
Person within ten Business Days after the receipt of the Initial Notice from
the Indemnified Person of the claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the
defense thereof with counsel of its own choice reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Person, and in the event of such assumption, shall have the
exclusive right, subject to compliance by the Indemnifying Person with
clauses (i) and (iii) of Section 9.7, to settle or compromise such claim,
suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Persons do not so elect to
assume such defense in accordance with the terms of this Section 9.6, the
Indemnified Person may defend such claim, suit, action or proceeding in such
manner as the Indemnified Person may deem appropriate, including settling
such claim or action or proceeding (after giving notice of the same to each
of the Indemnifying Persons) on such terms as the Indemnified Person may deem
appropriate, and the Indemnifying Persons shall assist and cooperate fully
with such defense as reasonably requested by the Indemnified Person and shall
promptly indemnify the Indemnified Person in accordance with the provisions
of Section 9.2 or 9.3, as applicable. If the Indemnifying Person so assumes
such defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty)
to participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel separate from the
counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person; provided, that the expense of
separate counsel so employed shall be borne by the Indemnified Person unless
there exists actual or potential conflicting interests between the
Indemnifying Persons and the Indemnified Person. Whether or not
the Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such claim, suit,
action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof.   

 9.7 Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or caused to be made by the Indemnified Person (unless the Indemnifying Person has the exclusive right to settle or compromise under Section 9.6) or the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, of any such claim, suit, action or proceeding of the kind referred to in Section 9.6 shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the amount of such settlement or compromise; provided that (i) no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as a result of any settlement or compromise without its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, (ii) if the Indemnifying Person has assumed the defense of a claim, suit, action or proceeding pursuant to Section 9.6, the Indemnified Person shall not compromise or settle such claim, suit, action or proceeding without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii) such settlement shall not contain any finding or admission of any violation of Law or any fault on the part of the Indemnified Person, and shall not have any effect on any other claims that may be made by the Indemnified Person against the third party bringing the claim, suit, action or proceeding.    ##### 

  

  

 9.8 Intentionally Left Blank.   

 9.9 Knowledge. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary other than Section 9.12, no party shall have (a) any liability for a breach of or inaccuracy in any representation or warranty by such party, if the party seeking indemnification actually knew (within the definition of Purchasers knowledge or Sellers knowledge, as applicable) at or before the Closing of such and the extent of such breach or inaccuracy or (b) any liability after the Closing for any breach of or failure to perform any covenant or obligation of such party if the party seeking indemnification knew (within the definition of Purchasers knowledge or Sellers knowledge, as applicable) at or before the Closing of such breach or failure.   

 9.10 Net Losses; Subrogation; Mitigation.   

 (a) Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the amount of any Losses incurred or suffered by an Indemnified Person shall be calculated after giving effect to (i) any insurance proceeds received by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such Losses, but only if the insurance premium relating to such proceeds has not been paid for by the Indemnified Person, (ii) any Tax Benefit realized by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) arising from the facts or circumstances giving rise to such Losses and from the payment of any amounts to the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) on account of any Losses and (iii) any other recoveries directly relating to such Loss obtained by the Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) from any other third party, less all Losses related to the pursuing and receipt of such recoveries and any related recoveries. Each Indemnified Person shall exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such proceeds, benefits and recoveries; provided, that no party shall be required to use such efforts if they would be detrimental in any material respect to such party. If any such net proceeds, benefits or recoveries are received by an Indemnified Person (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to any Losses after an Indemnifying Person has made a payment to the Indemnified Person with respect thereto, the Indemnified Person (or such Affiliate) shall pay to the Indemnifying Person the amount of such net proceeds, benefits or recoveries (up to the amount of the Indemnifying Persons payment).   

 (b) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Person in respect of any Losses, the Indemnifying Person shall, to the extent of such payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates) against any insurance company or any other third party from which the Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates) has contractual indemnity rights, in respect of the Losses to which such payment relates. Such Indemnified Person (and its Affiliates) and Indemnifying Person shall execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence or further perfect such subrogation rights.   

 (c) Purchasers, Sellers and GFC shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses, whether by asserting claims against a third party or by otherwise qualifying for a benefit that would reduce or eliminate an indemnified matter; provided, that no party shall be required to use such efforts if they would be detrimental in any material respect to such party.   

 9.11 Purchase Price Adjustments. Any amounts payable under Section 9.2 or Section 9.3 shall be treated by Purchasers and Sellers as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.    ##### 

  

  

 9.12 Special Rule for Fraud. Notwithstanding anything in this Article 9 or elsewhere in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty by any party to this Agreement that constitutes fraud or intentional deception, the representation or warranty that has been breached will survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (regardless of any investigation made by any party to this Agreement or on its behalf) and will continue in full force and effect for perpetuity, and any Losses from any such breach will not be subject to the indemnification basket, cap or other limitations contained in this Article 9.   

 9.13 Bulk Sales Act. CIT Canada shall not require GTF to comply with the requirements of the _Bulk Sales Act_ (Ontario). GTF and GFC warrant and agree to pay and discharge when due all claims of creditors asserted against CIT Canada by reason of such non-compliance to the extent that such liabilities are not specifically assumed by CIT Canada as part of the Canadian Assumed Obligations. GTF and GFC hereby jointly and severally agree to indemnify and hold CIT Canada harmless from, against and in respect of any loss, liability, cost or expense, including reasonable attorneys fees, suffered or incurred by CIT Canada by reason of the failure of GTF to pay or discharge any such claim.   

 9.14 GST Gross-up. The Indemnifying Person agrees that any indemnification payments under this Article 9 shall be increased by the amount of any applicable goods and services or Quebec sales tax, if any, deemed to be included in such payment; it being understood that this provision is not intended to allow the Indemnified Person to recover more than once for any such tax.   

ARTICLE 10.    

TAX MATTERS    

 10.1 Cooperation on Tax Matters.   

 (a) After Closing, upon reasonable written notice, Purchasers and Sellers shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance (to the extent within the control of such party) relating to the Transferred Assets (including access to and copies of books and records and, in the case of ad valorem Taxes, supporting information regarding the appraisal methods used by Sellers to report the value of the Equipment for personal property tax purposes) as is reasonably requested for: the filing of all Tax Returns; the making of any election related to Taxes; the preparation for any Tax audit by any Governmental Authority; and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or proceeding related to any Tax Return. Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate with each other in the conduct of any audit or other proceeding relating to (i) Taxes involving the Transferred Assets or (ii) the allocation of the Purchase Price. Sellers shall be liable for and shall hold Purchasers harmless from all Taxes levied, imposed or assessed with respect to any audit or other proceeding of or related to Taxes by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Transferred Assets and attributable to a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date. Purchasers and Sellers shall (i) retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Transferred Assets relating to any Taxable Period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Purchasers or Sellers, any    ##### 

  

    

extensions thereof) of the respective Taxable Periods, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Government Authority
and (ii) give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, Sellers, as the case may be, shall allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records.   

 (b) Purchasers and Sellers, upon reasonable request by the other party, shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person, and shall use good faith efforts to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed (including with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).   

 (c) Sellers shall provide Purchasers with copies of any tax abatement, tax deferral, tax credit or other similar tax incentive agreement or document between Sellers and any Governmental Authority with respect to ad valorem Taxes on the Transferred Assets and Sellers shall cooperate with Purchasers and the Governmental Authority to insure that, where possible, a Purchaser is substituted for a Seller as the recipient and the beneficiary of any such tax abatement, tax deferral, tax credit or similar tax incentive.   

 (d) Each Seller will provide to Purchasers at or prior to the Closing: (i) copies of all bona fide re-sale certificates; (ii) copies of all documentation to support all bona fide re-sale certificates; (iii) copies of any applicable sales/use tax documentation specifically required in California, Illinois, New Jersey and Ohio in connection with the transfer of tangible personal property; with respect to all Equipment Leases and the corresponding Equipment Lease Transactions.   

 10.2 Allocation of Purchase Price. Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Purchasers shall deliver to Sellers a schedule allocating the Purchase Price and Assumed Obligations among the Transferred Assets in accordance with section 1060 of the Code and the regulations thereunder (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation Schedule shall include a breakdown by Governmental Authority and shall in all other material respects contain sufficient detail to enable Purchasers and Sellers to determine Taxes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers have 30 days from the date of receipt of the Allocation Schedule to notify Purchasers in writing that Sellers dispute one or more items reflected on the Allocation Schedule as having no reasonable basis for the allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule, which notice shall include a detailed explanation of the basis for the dispute. If Sellers do not provide such notice to the Purchasers, Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted the Allocation Schedule as submitted by Purchasers. If Sellers do provide such notice, Sellers and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such dispute. If Sellers and Purchasers fail to resolve any such dispute within 30 days of Purchasers receipt of Sellers notice, the Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be engaged for resolution of the dispute with respect to the allocation of the Purchase Price and Assumed Obligations to the extent such allocation is in dispute. The determination of the Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on all parties. The parties agree not to take any position inconsistent with the Allocation Schedule for Tax reporting purposes. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accounting Firm in connection with the resolution of any dispute shall be paid equally by Purchasers and Sellers.    ##### 

  

  

 10.3 Apportioned Obligations. Liability for personal property taxes and similar ad valorem obligations levied with respect to the Transferred Assets for a taxable period which includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (collectively, the "Apportioned Obligations") shall be apportioned between Purchasers and Sellers based on the number of days of such taxable period included in the period ending on the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Tax Period") and the number of days of such taxable period included in the period after the Pre-Closing Tax Period (the "Post-Closing Tax Period"). Sellers shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Apportioned Obligations that is attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Purchasers shall be liable for the proportionate amount of such Apportioned Obligations that is attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period.   

 10.4 Transfer Taxes. All excise, goods and services, sales (including bulk sales), use, value added, registration, recording, documentary, conveyancing, property, and transfer taxes incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, at the Closing, (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") shall be borne equally (50/50) by Purchasers and Sellers. Notwithstanding the immediate prior sentence, Purchasers shall, at the Closing, pay to GTF all goods and services tax, harmonized sales tax, and Quebec sales tax imposed on CIT Canada and required to be collected by GTF under applicable Canadian federal or provincial law in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For greater certainty, Seller shall pay and Purchasers shall have no responsibility for Taxes on the net income of Seller or franchise taxes, or capital gains or other gains or profits realized by Sellers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Purchasers and Sellers shall cooperate in providing each other with any appropriate resale exemption certifications and other similar documentations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sellers shall be allocated 100% of all California Transfer Taxes (including any audit adjustments of such Taxes) that may arise from the transfer of (1) Transferred Assets that constitute California sale leasebacks and (2) leases with elections to pay California sales or use Tax measured by the purchase price rather than taxed on the lease stream. Also, for purposes of this provision, Transfer Taxes shall be allocated after taking into account any benefit to a party associated with Illinois sales or use Tax credits that may arise as a result of this Transaction.   

 10.5 Assignment. Sellers shall assign to Purchasers any rights Sellers may have to claim an offset or a credit for sales, use or similar Taxes with respect to the continuation of the Equipment Leases that may be used under applicable Law by Purchasers, but only to the extent that Sellers would not otherwise be entitled to claim such offsets or credits, except where the Obligor under the Equipment Lease is entitled to receive the credit or offset.   

ARTICLE 11.    

MISCELLANEOUS

ARTICLE 12.    

GUARANTY    

 GFC hereby unconditionally, absolutely, continuingly and irrevocably guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, to Purchasers and the Purchaser Indemnified Parties the full and timely payment, if any, and performance by each Seller of all of their covenants, agreements, obligations and liabilities arising under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now or hereafter existing, or due or to become due, including all indemnification obligations (collectively, the "Obligations"). If any of the Obligations shall not be paid or performed according to their terms, GFC shall immediately pay, perform, or cause the performance of the same, this Guaranty being a guaranty of full payment and performance and not of collectibility. This Guaranty is an absolute, unconditional, and continuing guaranty and is in no way conditioned upon any requirement that Purchasers first attempt to collect payment or seek performances of any of the Obligations from either or both Sellers or any other obligor or guarantor, or resort to any other security or other means of obtaining payment or performance of any of the Obligations or upon any other condition or contingency whatsoever. GFCs obligations under this Article 12 shall in no way be impaired, affected, reduced or released by reason of the voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale, or other disposition of all or substantially all the assets of either or both Sellers or the marshalling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy, assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement, composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings or any other inability to pay or perform affecting, either or both Sellers or any of their respective assets.    ##### 

  

  

 Purchasers shall have the right, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of GFC and without relieving GFC of any liability hereunder, to deal with either or both Sellers, in such manner as Purchasers, in their sole and absolute discretion, deems fit and proper, and to this end GFC hereby gives to Purchasers the full authority in its discretion to do any and all of the following things, without notice to, or obtaining the consent of, GFC: (a) grant waivers, extensions, renewals or other indulgences under any Transaction Document or any other document relating to the Obligations; (b) waive the payment or performance of any of the Obligations; (c) modify or amend any of the terms or provisions contained in any Transaction Document or any other document relating to the Obligations; (d) vary, exchange, release or discharge, wholly or partially, or delay in or abstain from perfecting or enforcing any security for or guaranty of the Obligations by any other person; (e) accept partial payment or performance of any of the Obligations; or (f) compromise or make any settlement or other arrangement with either or both Sellers or any other guarantor of the Obligations.   

 GFC hereby consents to all of the terms and provisions of each Transaction Document, as the same may be from time to time amended or modified in accordance with their terms. GFC hereby irrevocably waives: (a) notice of acceptance of this Guaranty; (b) notice of any amendment or any change in the terms of the Transaction Documents or any other documents relating to the Obligations; (c) notice of any breach, violation or default under or in connection with any Transaction Document or any other documents relating to the Obligations or any other present or future agreement relating directly or indirectly thereto; (d) demand for performance or observance of and enforcement of any provisions of, or any pursuit or exhaustion of, any rights or remedies against the either of both Sellers or any other guarantor or obligor who becomes liable in any manner for any of the Obligations, and any requirements of diligence or promptness on the part of Purchasers in connection therewith; (e) diligence, presentment, protest, notice of dishonor and notice of default in the payment of any amount at any time payable by the either of both Sellers under or in connection with the Transaction Documents or any other documents relating to the Obligations; and (f) all defenses based on suretyship or impairment of collateral and any defenses that either or both Sellers may assert on the Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of warranty, fraud, statute of frauds, bankruptcy, lack of legal capacity, statute of limitations, creditor liability and accord and satisfaction.   

 GFC further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as guarantor only, to pay forthwith upon demand, all reasonable costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements) incurred or expended in connection with the enforcement of this guaranty, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this guaranty if such interest is awarded by a court of competent jurisdiction.   

 GFCs successors and assigns shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Guaranty. For a period of five years from the Closing, GFC shall not consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person; provided, that nothing contained in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent GFC from consolidating with, merging with or into, or selling all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any Person so long as (a) such Person assumes the obligations of GFC under this Agreement by operation of law in connection with such transaction or (b) if such Person does not assume the obligations of GFC under this Agreement by operation of law in connection with such transaction, such Person    ##### 

  

    

expressly assumes the obligations of GFC under this Agreement and expressly
agrees to be bound by all other provisions applicable to GFC under this
Agreement.    #####
