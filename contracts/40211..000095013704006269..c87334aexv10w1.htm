no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person
as a result of any settlement or compromise without its prior written consent,

written consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, and (iii)&nbsp;such settlement shall not contain
any finding or admission of any violation of Law or any fault on the part of
the Indemnified Person, and shall not have any effect on any other claims that
may be made by the Indemnified Person against the third party bringing the
claim, suit, action or proceeding.

The Allocation Schedule shall include a breakdown by Governmental Authority and
shall in all other material respects contain sufficient detail to enable
Purchasers and Sellers to determine Taxes applicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Sellers have 30&nbsp;days from the date of receipt
of the Allocation Schedule to notify Purchasers in writing that Sellers dispute
one or more items reflected on the Allocation Schedule as having no reasonable
basis for the allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule, which notice
shall include a detailed explanation of the basis for the dispute. If Sellers
do not provide such notice to the Purchasers, Sellers shall be deemed to have
accepted the Allocation Schedule as submitted by Purchasers. If Sellers do
provide such notice, Sellers and Purchasers shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such dispute. If Sellers and Purchasers fail to resolve any such
dispute within 30&nbsp;days of Purchasers&#146; receipt of Sellers&#146; notice, the
Arbitrating Accounting Firm shall be engaged for resolution of the dispute with

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">GUARANTY



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GFC hereby unconditionally, absolutely, continuingly and irrevocably
guarantees, as a primary obligor and not merely as a surety, to Purchasers and
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties the full and timely payment, if any, and
performance by each Seller of all of their covenants, agreements, obligations
and liabilities arising under or pursuant to this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents, whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, now
or hereafter existing, or due or to become due, including all indemnification
obligations (collectively, the &#147;Obligations&#148;). If any of the Obligations shall
not be paid or performed according to their terms, GFC shall immediately pay,
perform, or cause the performance of the same, this Guaranty being a guaranty
of full payment and performance and not of collectibility. This Guaranty is an
absolute, unconditional, and continuing guaranty and is in no way conditioned
upon any requirement that Purchasers first attempt to collect payment or seek
performances of any of the Obligations from either or both Sellers or any other
obligor or guarantor, or resort to any other security or other means of
obtaining payment or performance of any of the Obligations or upon any other
condition or contingency whatsoever. GFC&#146;s obligations under this Article&nbsp;12
shall in no way be impaired, affected, reduced or released by reason of the
voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, sale, or other disposition
of all or substantially all the assets of either or both Sellers or the
marshalling of assets and liabilities, receivership, insolvency, bankruptcy,
assignment for the benefit of creditors, reorganization, arrangement,
composition with creditors or readjustment of, or other similar proceedings or
any other inability to pay or perform affecting, either or both Sellers or any
of their respective assets.

absolute discretion, deems fit and proper, and to this end GFC hereby gives to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GFC hereby consents to all of the terms and provisions of each Transaction
Document, as the same may be from time to time amended or modified in
accordance with their terms. GFC hereby irrevocably waives: (a)&nbsp;notice of
acceptance of this Guaranty; (b)&nbsp;notice of any amendment or any change in the
terms of the Transaction Documents or any other documents relating to the
Obligations; (c)&nbsp;notice of any breach, violation or default under or in
connection with any Transaction Document or any other documents relating to the
Obligations or any other present or future agreement relating directly or
indirectly thereto; (d)&nbsp;demand for performance or observance of and enforcement
of any provisions of, or any pursuit or exhaustion of, any rights or remedies
against the either of both Sellers or any other guarantor or obligor who
becomes liable in any manner for any of the Obligations, and any requirements
of diligence or promptness on the part of Purchasers in connection therewith;
(e)&nbsp;diligence, presentment, protest, notice of dishonor and notice of default
in the payment of any amount at any time payable by the either of both Sellers
under or in connection with the Transaction Documents or any other documents
relating to the Obligations; and (f)&nbsp;all defenses based on suretyship or
impairment of collateral and any defenses that either or both Sellers may
assert on the Obligations, including failure of consideration, breach of
warranty, fraud, statute of frauds, bankruptcy, lack of legal capacity, statute
of limitations, creditor liability and accord and satisfaction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GFC further agrees, as the principal obligor and not as guarantor only, to
pay forthwith upon demand, all reasonable costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and disbursements) incurred or expended in
connection with the enforcement of this guaranty, together with interest on
amounts recoverable under this guaranty if such interest is awarded by a court
of competent jurisdiction.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GFC&#146;s successors and assigns shall be bound by the terms and conditions of
this Guaranty. For a period of five years from the Closing, GFC shall not
consolidate with, merge with or into, or sell all or substantially all of its
properties or assets to any Person; provided, that nothing contained in this
paragraph shall be deemed to prevent GFC from consolidating with, merging with
or into, or selling all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person so long as (a)&nbsp;such Person assumes the obligations of GFC under this
Agreement by operation of law in connection with such transaction or (b)&nbsp;if
such Person does not assume the obligations of GFC under this Agreement by
operation of law in connection with such transaction, such Person
