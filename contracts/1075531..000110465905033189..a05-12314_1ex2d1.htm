entitled to review and/or to have an accountant appointed by the Seller to
audit the Closing Balance Sheet. Any objections on the Closing Balance Sheet
resulting from the review and/or audit shall be notified in writing ("
**Seller s Disagreement Notice**") to the Purchaser and the Company within
one month from such submittance of the Closing Balance Sheet. The Sellers

review and/or audit, the Company shall provide and the Purchaser shall allow

thereof or take extracts there from and further (ii) with such information as
the Seller and its accountant shall reasonable require. The information so
made available to the Seller and its accountant shall be subject to a duty of
confidentiality except for disclosures necessary for resolving any Disputed
Item or otherwise required by applicable law or stock exchange rules.

  



  

3.4.2 Where no Sellers Disagreement Notice has been submitted against the

Balance Sheet, the Closing Balance Sheet and the Equity reflected therein
shall for the purpose hereof be agreed between and be binding on the Parties.

  



  

3.4.3 Where Sellers Disagreement Notice has been submitted, the Parties
shall try to resolve the Disputed Items. Should they fail to do so within one
month from the Sellers Disagreement Notice (" **Disagreement Date** "), then
any and all such Disputed Items (for the purpose of this Article the " **Open
Issues** ") and the scope of the assignment to settle such Open Issues, shall
be agreed and submitted to and settled by an accountant of an independent
reputable firm of accountants (" **Independent Accountant** ") to be
jointly appointed by the Parties within twenty (20) Business Days of the
Disagreement Date or, if the Parties fail to agree on such appointment and
assignment within that period, by the Chairman of the Netherlands Institute
of Registered Accountants ("NIVRA"). The Parties shall within twenty (20)
Business Days after such appointment submit the Closing Balance Sheet, the
Open Issues and statements of their respective positions in writing to the
Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall determine the
further procedural rules at his discretion.

  



  

3.4.4 The Parties undertake to procure that the Independent Accountant shall
then finally resolve the Open Issues by way of a written binding advice ("
_bindend advies"_ ) in accordance with this Agreement and that the
Independent Accountant shall notify the Parties of his decision, inter alia
certifying the effect of his determination on the Equity as set forth in the
Closing Balance Sheet and the resulting final amount of the Equity which he
has established as at the Closing Date, as promptly as possible and in any
event no later than forty (40) Business Days after his appointment. The fees
and

  



  

4   

     
   

  



  

expenses arising out of the engagement of the Independent Accountant shall be
borne by the Seller and the Purchaser, each for fifty (50)%.

  



  

3.4.5 The failure of either the Seller or the Purchaser to timely submit to
the Independent Accountant a written statement of its position or to
otherwise fail to respond to any request of the Independent Accountant for
information shall not preclude or delay the Independent Accountants
determination of the Open Issues on the basis of the information which will
have been submitted.

  



  

3.4.6 The Company shall, subject to reasonable notice, give all information
and assistance to the Independent Accountant requested by the Independent
Accountant for the preparation of his binding advice. Simultaneously with
providing such information to the Independent Accountant, the Company shall
provide the Seller and the Purchaser with the same information. All other
information provided by either the Seller or the Purchaser to the Independent
Accountant shall simultaneously be provided by either the Seller or the
Purchaser, as the case may be, to the Purchaser, the Company and the Seller.

  



  

3.4.7 For the avoidance of doubt, Parties agree that the Company may include
or exclude items in the Closing Balance Sheet in accordance with the
Accounting Principles even if these items are or could be deemed a breach of
any of the Warranties, it being understood that to the extent such item(s)
lead to an adjustment of the Consideration pursuant to this Article 3, such
item(s) cannot be claimed for under the Warranties.

  



  

3.4.8 The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles. For the purpose of this Article 3.4.8 Accounting
Principles shall mean the in the following order of priority (i)

with GAAP and (ii) GAAP at the Closing Date. The Seller and the Purchaser
furthermore agree that the investment in the domain name Booking.com (Euro
500,000) shall not be amortized at Closing and shall be valued at historical
costs in the Closing Balance Sheet. The Seller acknowledges that the Closing
Balance Sheet shall be prepared solely for the purposes of determining the
Equity with a view to calculating the adjustment to the Consideration (if
any), and that the statutory accounts or balance sheet(s) of the Group as per
the Closing Date may deviate from the Closing Balance Sheet.

  



  

3.5 _Payment of shortfall or excess_. By no later than three (3)
Business Days after the Equity has been established either by the Parties or
the Independent Accountant pursuant to Article 3.4 the Purchaser shall pay
the amount of the excess referred to in Article 3.3 to the Seller, or, as
the case may be, the Seller shall pay the amount of the shortfall referred to
in Article 3.3, if any, to the Purchaser by transferring such amount to a
bank account to be notified by the Party entitled to the payment.

8   

     
   

  



  

5.4 _Qualifications._ Where any statement in the Warranties or any
confirmation or certificate given by the Warrantor hereunder or pursuant
hereto is qualified by the expression " _so far as the Warrantor is aware_ "

expression, that statement shall be deemed to include an additional statement
that it has been made after due and careful enquiry.

  



  

5.5 _Information from Group._ The Warrantor hereby agrees with the Purchaser
to waive any rights which it may have in respect of any misrepresentation or
inaccuracy in, or omission from, any information or advice supplied or given

# ** _ARTICLE 6  REMEDIES_**

of the Warranties (" **Breach** ") the Warrantor shall reimburse and hold
harmless (" _schadeloos stellen"_ ) either the Purchaser or the pertinent
member of the Group (at the option of the Purchaser) for all Damages suffered
by the Purchaser or the relevant member of the Group as a result of such
Breach, without prejudice to other statutory rights of the Purchaser. In
addition, in the event of a default (" _tekortkoming_ ") in the compliance
(" _nakoming_ ") by Seller of any other obligations under this Agreement ("
**Default** "), the Seller shall reimburse and hold harmless (" _schadeloos
stellen"_ ) either the Purchaser or the pertinent member of the Group (at the
option of the Purchaser) for all Damages suffered by the Purchaser or the
relevant member of the Group as a result of such Default, without prejudice
to other statutory rights of the Purchaser.

  



  

6.2 _Breaches of Seller s and Purchasers Warranties._ In the event of a
breach of any of the Sellers Warranties or the Purchasers Warranties,
the Party in breach shall reimburse and hold harmless (" _schadeloos

6.3 _Claim on behalf of Group._ It is expressly understood that if and to the
extent an event gives rise to a Claim under more than one Warranty,
the Purchaser shall be entitled to file a Claim under any such breached
Warranty as it may deem fit, on its own behalf and/or on behalf of

  



  

9   

     
   

  



  

the relevant member of the Group as third party beneficiary of the right to
be reimbursed and held harmless pursuant to this Article 6, provided,
however, that it cannot claim reimbursement of the same Damages twice. Also,
for the avoidance of doubt it, is expressly confirmed and understood that
where this Article 6 refers to "Damages suffered by the Purchaser or relevant
member of the Group", such damages shall not be deemed to have been doubly
incurred by both the Purchaser and the relevant member of the Group, which
means that any Damages suffered for which the relevant member of the Group is
reimbursed cannot be claimed twice by the Purchaser, and vice versa.

  



  

6.4 _Survival Period_. Subject to Article 6.6, all Warranties shall survive
the Closing Date for 15 months provided, however, that:

  



  

(i) the Warranties set forth in Section 14 ( _taxation_ ) of the Warranty
Schedule shall survive the Closing Date until the relevant statute of
limitations with respect to Taxes, including the term during which additional
assessments can be levied (" _navorderingstermijn_ or _naheffingstermijn_ ",
as referred to in Articles 16 and 20 of the " _Algemene wet inzake
Rijksbelastingen_ "), shall have expired;

  



  

(ii) the Warranties set forth in Section 1 and 2 ( _organisation and
capitalisation_ ) of the Warranty Schedule shall be unlimited in time; and

  



  

All such Warranties shall expire on such dates, except for Claims asserted by
the Purchaser prior to such dates.

  



  

6.5 _Threshold_.

  



  

(a) The Purchaser shall not be entitled to seek indemnification for any Claim
unless the amount of Damages relating to such Claim exceeds Euro 40,000
(forty thousand Euros).

  



  

(b) The Purchaser agrees not to enforce any Claim until the aggregate amount
of all indemnifiable Claims exceeds Euro 300,000 (three hundred thousand
Euros) and then the Purchaser shall be entitled to recover all Claims from
the first Euro.

  



  

6.6 _Qualifications to Limitations._ If in any case a Claim has arisen by (i)
reason of fraud or wilful concealment or dishonesty or deliberate non-
disclosure on the part of the Warrantor prior to or on the Closing Date or
(ii) any signatory on its behalf being claimed not to have had legal
authority or capacity to enter into the Agreement or any agreement ancillary
thereto, then in any such case none of the limitations set forth in Articles
6.4 (survival), 6.5 (thresholds) and 6.8 (limitation of liability) shall
apply. Furthermore, in the event a Claim has arisen by reason of fraud ("
_bedrog_ ") on the part of Norden, Koolen and/or Van Ree or any of them, the
latter three individuals will be deemed to have been a Warrantor as per the
Closing for the purposes of this

  



  

10   

     
   

  



  

Agreement together with the Seller on a joint and several basis ("
_hoofdelijk_ "), and for the avoidance of any doubt then the limitations set

liability) shall not apply to Norden, Koolen and Van Ree.

  



  

6.7 _Additional Indemnity._ In addition, and without prejudice to Article
6.1, the Seller shall indemnify and hold the Purchaser and the Group harmless
from any and all Damages arising out of or in connection with:

  



  

(a) any and all liability of the Group for Taxes attributable to periods
ending on or before the Closing Date to the extent not reserved against in
the Closing Balance Sheet, including any and all Taxes ensuing from or
related to (i) the management and consultancy agreements on the basis of
which Messrs Norden, Docter and Koolen provide services to the Group; (ii)
hiring of employees from employment agencies; and (iii) hiring self-employed
personnel, either directly or through closely held companies;

  



  

(b) any and all liability of the Group Companies for Taxes that arise after
Closing as a result of an act, omission or transaction by a Person other than
the Group Companies and which liability for Tax falls upon the Group
Companies as a result of its having been in the same group for Tax purposes
("fiscal unity" in Dutch " _fiscale eenheid_ ")) as that Person at any time

(c) any and all liability of the Group Companies for Taxes resulting as a
consequence of the termination as per Closing of the fiscal unity between the

6.6, the aggregate liability of the Warrantor under this Agreement shall be
limited to Euro 10,900,000 (ten million nine hundred thousand Euros).

6.9.1 The Warrantor shall not be liable in respect of any Claim in respect of

after Closing unless introduced to comply with any requirement of law which
was not being properly complied with by the Group on or prior to Closing.

  



  

6.9.2 The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of any Claim to the
extent that such Claim relates to any losses which have been recovered by the
Group pursuant to a policy of insurance in force or would have been recovered
if the Group had maintained in full force and effect insurance cover of a
reasonable scope having regard to the nature of the Groups business from
time to time.

  



  

6.9.3 The Warrantors shall not be liable in respect of a Claim to the extent
that specific provision or reserve in respect of the matter giving rise to
the Claim shall have been made in the Closing Balance Sheet. If any Claim is
made, the Purchaser shall use its reasonable endeavours to procure that the
Warrantor and its representatives and advisers are given reasonable access to
the books and records and the working papers underlying the Closing Balance
Sheet for the purposes of ascertaining whether any, and if so what, amount is
applicable to the Claim for the purposes of this Article 6.9.3.

  



  

6.9.4 The Warrantor shall not be liable in respect of any Claim if and to the
extent that the loss occasioned in relation thereto has been recovered under
any other Claim.

  



  

6.9.5 Parties acknowledge that article 6:102 of the DCC (" _eigen schuld_ ")
will be applicable to the calculation of the Damages.

  



  

6.9.6 In determining the amount of any Claim the following shall be taken
into account: (i) any Tax refund received by any of the Group Companies and
(ii) any reduction in Tax realized by any of the Group Companies (to the
extent that such refund or reduction is attributable to the facts giving rise
to the Claim), as well as (iii) any tax payable by the Purchaser upon
contribution to or payment to a Group Company of payments for Damages
received.

  



  

12   

     
   

  



  

6.10 _Claim Procedure._

  



  

(a) The Purchaser shall give the Warrantor written notice ("
**Indemnification Notice** ") of any facts and the circumstances giving rise
to a Claim under this Agreement within 30 days of the Purchasers becoming
aware of the facts and circumstances giving rise to such Claims. However,
failure of the Purchaser to give such notice within such 30-day period shall
not relieve the Warrantor of its liability with respect to such Claim except
to the extent that Purchasers failure to give notice within such period
causes damages to the Warrantor.

  



  

(b) If the Claim relates to a Claim or the commencement of an action or
proceeding by a Third Party against any member of the Group and/or the
Purchaser, then the Warrantor shall have, upon request within sixty (60) days
after receipt of the Indemnification Notice (but not in any event after the
settlement or compromise of such claim), the right to defend, at their own
expense and by their own counsel, any such matter involving the asserted
liability of the relevant member of the Group and/or the Purchaser; provided,
however, that if the relevant member of the Group and/or the Purchaser
determines that there is a reasonable probability that a Claim may materially
and adversely affect it, it shall at its own discretion have the right to
defend (with the participation of the Warrantor, if the Warrantor so elects),
compromise or settle such Claim or suit, provided however the Warrantor has
been timely involved in the settlement negotiations.

  



  

(c) If the Claim does not relate to a Claim or the commencement of an action
or proceeding by a Third Party, the Warrantor shall have thirty (30) Business
Days after receipt of the Indemnification Notice during which it shall have
the right to object to the subject matter and the amount of the claim set
forth in the Indemnification Notice by delivering written notice thereof to
the Purchaser. If the Warrantor does not so object within such thirty-day
period, it shall be conclusively deemed to have agreed that it is obligated
to indemnify Purchaser for the matters set forth in the Indemnification
Notice. If the Warrantor sends notice to the Purchaser objecting to the
matters set forth in the Indemnification Notice, the Warrantor and the
Purchaser shall use their best efforts to settle the Claim. If the Warrantor
and the Purchaser are unable to settle the Claim, the matter shall be
resolved in the manner set forth in Article 12 of this Agreement.

  



  

(d) If the Purchaser makes any Claim or gives notice of any Claim the
Purchaser shall, and shall procure that the Company shall, on a confidential
basis solely for the purpose of enabling the Warrantor to assess the Claim or
potential Claim (a) provide relevant documents to the Warrantor and (b) (if
relevant to the claim) request the

  



  

13   

     
   

  



  

auditors (past and present) of the Company to make available their audit
working papers in respect of audits of the Companys accounts for any
relevant accounting period in connection with such Claim or potential Claim
to the Warrantor.

  



  

(e) All Claims will first be settled from the Escrowed Consideration.

  



  

6.11 _Other Indemnification Provisions._ The remedies provided in this Article
6 shall not be exclusive of or limit any other remedies that may be available
at law.

  



  

# ** _ARTICLE 7 - RESTRICTIONS ON SELLER AND CERTAIN RELATED PARTIES_**

  

# 

  

7.1 _Restrictions._ The Seller undertakes that, except with the prior written
consent of the Purchaser:

  



  

## (a) for the period of three years after Closing it will not, within any
country in which the Group has carried on business during the year preceding
Closing either on its own account or in conjunction with or on behalf of any
person, firm or company carry on or be engaged, concerned or interested,
directly or indirectly, whether as shareholder, director, employee, partner,
agent or otherwise carry on the Business (other than as a holder of not more
than 5 per cent of the issued shares or debentures of any company listed on a
stock exchange);

  

## 

  

## (b) for the period of three years after Closing it will not either on its
own account or in conjunction with or on behalf of any other person, firm or

Group the custom of any person, firm, company or organisation who shall at
any time within the year preceding Closing have been a customer, identified
prospective customer, representative, agent, or correspondent of the Group or
in the habit of dealing with the Group; or enter into any contract for sale
and purchase or accept business from any such person, firm, company or
organisation in a business area in which the Group operates;

  

## 

  

## (c) for the period of three years after Closing it will not either on its
own account or in conjunction with or on behalf of any other person, firm or
company employ, solicit, entice away or attempt to employ, solicit or entice
away from the Group any person who at Closing is, or at the date of, or
within the year preceding such employment, solicitation, enticement or
attempt shall have been a manager, consultant or employee of the Group
whether or not such person would commit a breach of contract by reason of
leaving such employment;

  

## 

  

## (d) it will not at any time hereafter make use of or disclose or divulge
to any person (other than to directors or employees of the Group whose
province it is to know the same)

  



  

14   

     
   

  



  

## and will keep confidential any information (other than any information
properly available to the public or disclosed or divulged pursuant to an
order of a court of competent jurisdiction) relating to the Group, the
identity of their customers and suppliers, their products, finance,
contractual arrangements, business or methods of business;

  

## 

  

## (e) if, in connection with the business or affairs of the Group, it shall
have obtained trade secrets or other confidential information belonging to a
Third Party under an agreement purporting to bind the Group which contained
restrictions on disclosure it will not at any time infringe such
restrictions; or

  

## 

  

## (f) it will not at any time hereafter in relation to any trade, business
or company use a name, mark or any word confusingly similar thereto in such a
way as to be capable of or likely to be confused with any trademark of the
Group and it shall use its best endeavours to procure that no such trademark
shall be used by any person, firm or company with which it is connected.

  

## 

  

7.2 _Certain related parties._ The Seller procures that the Key Managers and
the Management Shareholders shall be bound by and observe the provisions
of this Article 7 as if they were parties covenanting with the Purchaser
in the same terms.

  



  

7.3 _Continued Effectiveness._ While the restrictions contained in this
Article 7 are considered by the Parties to be reasonable in all the
circumstances, it is recognized that restrictions of the nature in question
may fail for technical reasons and accordingly it is hereby agreed and
declared that if any of such restrictions shall be adjudged to be void as
going beyond what is reasonable in all the circumstances for the protection
of the interests of the Purchaser, but would be valid if part of the wording
thereof were deleted or the periods thereof reduced or the range of
activities or area dealt with thereby reduced in scope the said restriction
shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to make it valid and
effective.

  



  

15   

     
   

  



  

# ** _ARTICLE 8 - RESTRICTION ON ANNOUNCEMENTS_**

  

# 

  

Each of the Parties hereto undertakes that prior to Closing and thereafter it
will not (save as required by law) make any announcement in connection with
this Agreement, unless the other Party hereto shall have given its written
consent to such announcement (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld
and may be given either generally or in a specific case or cases and may be
subject to conditions).

  



  

# ** _ARTICLE 9 - CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION_**

  

# 

  

9.1 _Non-disclosure._ The Parties undertake that they shall treat as strictly
confidential all Confidential Information received or obtained by them or
their employees, agents or advisers as a result of entering into
or performing this Agreement including information relating to the provisions
of this Agreement, the negotiations leading up to this Agreement, the
subject matter of this Agreement or the business or affairs of each of the
Parties or any member of their group and subject to the provisions of Article
9.2 that they will not at any time hereafter make use of or disclose or
divulge to any person any such Confidential Information and shall use their
best endeavours to prevent the publication or disclosure of any such
information.

  



  

9.2 _Exceptions._ The restrictions contained in Article 9.1 shall not apply so
as to prevent the Parties from making any disclosure required by law or by
any securities exchange or supervisory or regulatory or governmental body
pursuant to rules to which the relevant Party is subject or from making
any disclosure to any professional adviser for the purposes of obtaining
advice (provided always that the provisions of this Article shall apply to
and the Parties shall procure that they apply to, and are observed in
relation to, the use or disclosure by such professional adviser of the
information provided to him) nor shall the restrictions apply in respect of
any information which comes into the public domain otherwise than by a breach
of this Article by the Parties.

  



  

# ** _ARTICLE 10 - MISCELLANEOUS_**

  

# 

  

10.1 _Parties  Costs._ Each Party to this Agreement shall pay its own costs
and disbursements of and incidental to this Agreement and the sale and
purchase of the Shares, provided that all costs associated with the Notarial
Transfer Deed shall be borne by the Purchaser. The Group shall not pay any
fees or other costs of outside advisors in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

10.2 _Waiver._ No failure or delay by the Purchaser in exercising any right,
power or remedy under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of the same preclude any further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or

  



  

16   

     
   

  



  

remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, no waiver by the Purchaser of any
breach by the Seller of any provision hereof shall be deemed to be a waiver
of any subsequent breach of that or any other provision hereof.

  



  

10.3 _Assignment._ The Warrantor and the Purchaser may not assign this
Agreement (" _contractsoverneming"_ ) or assign or encumber its rights
thereunder, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld save that, with respect to the
Purchaser such consent shall not be required provided (i) that the Purchaser
shall assign this Agreement to an Affiliate and (ii) in the event that such
Affiliate is no longer an Affiliate, this Agreement shall be re-assigned to
the Purchaser.

  



  

10.4 _Entire Agreement._ This Agreement (together with any documents referred
to herein or executed contemporaneously or at Closing by the Parties in
connection herewith) constitutes the whole agreement between the Parties
and supersedes any previous agreements or arrangements between them relating
to the subject matter of this Agreement and it is expressly declared that
no variations of this Agreement shall be effective unless made in writing
and executed by the Parties.

  



  

10.5 _Continuity of obligations._ All the provisions of this Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect notwithstanding Closing (except insofar
as they set out obligations that have been fully performed at Closing).

  



  

10.6 _Severability._ If any provision or part of a provision of this
Agreement shall be, or be found by any authority or court of
competent jurisdiction to be, invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity
or unenforceability shall not affect the other provisions or parts of
such provisions of this Agreement, all of which shall remain in full force
and effect.

  



  

10.7 _Other Rights and Remedies._ Any right of termination conferred upon
the Purchaser hereby shall be in addition to and without prejudice to all
other rights and remedies available to it (and, without prejudice to the
generality of the foregoing, shall not extinguish any right to damages to
which the Purchaser may be entitled in respect of the breach of this
Agreement) and no exercise or failure to exercise such a right of termination
shall constitute a waiver by the Purchaser of any such other right or remedy.

  



  

10.8 _Release._ At Closing the Seller shall have released the Group from any
and all obligations and liabilities of the Group vis-a-vis the Seller.

  



  

10.9 _Further acts._ Upon and after Closing the Seller shall do and execute
or cause to be done and executed all such further acts, deeds, documents and
things as may be necessary to give effect to the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

17   

     
   

  



  

10.10 _Interpretation._ This Agreement shall constitute an allocation of
risks between the parties. The Parties deem the security they may derive from
the provisions of this Agreement essential.

  



  

10.11 _Third Party Beneficiary Rights._ Unless this Agreement explicitly
provides otherwise, it contains no stipulations for the benefit of a Third
Party which could be invoked by a Third Party against a Party, except for
each member of the Group, which are considered as a Third Party beneficiary
of the right to be reimbursed and held harmless and to file cross claims ("
_in vrijwaring oproeping_ ") in the event of a Claim in accordance with
Article 6\. However, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
modified or supplemented without the consent of the members of the Group.

  



  

10.12 _Civil Law Notary_. The Parties are aware of the fact that the Civil
Law Notary works with Baker and McKenzie, the firm that advises the Purchaser
in this transaction. With reference to the Code of Conduct (" _Verordening
beroeps- en gedragsregels"_ ) established by the Royal Notarial Professional
Organisation (" _Koninklijke Notari ele Beroepsorganisatie"_), the Parties
hereby explicitly agree (i) that the Civil Law Notary shall execute any
notarial deed(s) related to this Agreement and (ii) that the Purchaser is
assisted and represented by Baker and McKenzie in relation to this Agreement
and any agreements that may be concluded, or disputes that may arise, in
connection therewith.

  



  

10.13 _Taxes_.

  



  

10.13.1 If, after the sale, the Seller owes any corporate income or other tax
with respect to, or in connection with, legal entities that are part of the
Group Companies, resulting in a benefit for the relevant company, e.g., as a
result of the application of Article 15(a)(i) of the Dutch Corporate Income
Tax Act 1969, the latter will reimburse the Seller for the amount of the
benefit thus obtained if and as soon as said benefit arises. The Purchaser
will ensure that this reimbursement will take place as described above.

  



  

10.13.2 The Group Companies which up to the Closing Date belong to the "Blue
Sky Investments B.V. fiscal unity", will pay to the Seller the amount of
corporate income tax relating to such Group Companies for any period up to
Closing as follows. Within two weeks from the Closing Date, the Seller will
request from the tax authorities a provisional assessment (" _voorlopige
aanslag_ ") for the financial year 2005, in which assessment the result of
and tax payable by the Group Companies for the period up to Closing is
included. Based on this assessment, the amount of corporate income tax
relating to the Group Companies for any period up to Closing that has not
been previously paid to Seller will be paid directly to the tax authorities
by the relevant Group Companies. If this payment is less than the payable to
the Seller set forth on the Closing Balance Sheet (on account of corporate
income tax owed by the Group Companies to the Seller) the difference will
immediately be

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

paid by the relevant Group Companies to the Seller, after which the full
payable to the Seller on account of corporate income tax will be deemed to
have been paid.

  



  

10.14 _Waiver of Rights_. To the extent permitted by law, the Parties hereby
waive their rights under Articles 6:228 through 6:230 and 6:265
through 6:272, respectively, of the Civil Code to rescind (" _ontbinden"_ )
or nullify (" _vernietigen"_ ) on the ground of mistake (" _dwaling"_ ).

  



  

10.15 _Spouse approval_. Koolen declares that he has obtained from his spouse
the requisite approvals as referred to in Article 1:88 sub-Article
1, beginning and under Article c, of the DCC. A true copy of the
relevant statement from which such approval is evident, is attached hereto as
**_Schedule 10.15_**.

  



  

10.16 _Keep well_. Each of Norden, Koolen and Van Ree procure that during the
survival periods as set forth in Article 6.4 the Seller will remain in
existence and in good standing.

  



  

10.17 _Domain names_.  Subsequent to Closing, if requested by the Purchaser,
the Seller will procure and transfer any relevant domain names of Bookings
Americas.
