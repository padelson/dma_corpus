to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined. Whenever the context
may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and

be followed by the phrase "without limitation." The words "herein," "hereof" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import refer to this Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules) in its entirety and not to any part hereof unless the
context shall otherwise require. As used herein, the term "to the Company's

to it as amended and supplemented from time to time (and, in the case of a
statute or regulation, to any successor provisions). Any reference in this
Agreement to a "day" or number of "days" (without the explicit qualification of
"business") shall be interpreted as a reference to a calendar day or number of
calendar days. If any action or notice is to be taken or given on or by a
particular calendar day, and such calendar day is not a business day, then such
action or notice shall be deferred until, or may be taken or given on, the next
business day. As applied to Parent and its Subsidiaries, the phrases "as soon as
reasonably practicable," "as promptly as practicable" and similar phrases shall
mean "reasonably promptly under the circumstances, in light of the other burdens
on the time and attention of the directors, officers, employees and agents of
Parent and the relative benefits to Parent of this Agreement and such other
burdens."

form of Exhibit 2.1(a).

2.3      Conversion of Securities.

         (a) Conversion of Company Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Liberty
Media, the Company or the holders of any of their securities:

                  (i) Each share of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than such shares to be canceled in accordance
with Section 2.3(a)(iii) and subject to Sections 2.4(f) and 2.4(j)) shall be
converted into and represent the right to receive, and shall be exchangeable for
(i) 0.104 of a share (the "Stock Exchange Ratio") of Class A Liberty Media Group
Stock (the "Stock Consideration") and (ii) $2.75 in cash (the "Cash
Consideration").

                  (ii) All shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock issued
pursuant to this Section 2.3(a) will be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable. All shares of Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and retired, and, subject to Section 2.4(j), each holder of a
certificate representing any such shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant
to this Section 2.3(a), including any cash in lieu of a fractional share payable
pursuant to Section 2.4(f) (and any dividends or other distributions payable
pursuant to Section 2.4(g)), with respect thereto upon the surrender of such
certificate in accordance with Section 2.4, without interest.

                  (iii) Each share of Company Common Stock that immediately
prior to the Effective Time is held by the Company as a treasury share shall be
canceled and retired without payment of any consideration therefor and without
any conversion thereof into the Merger Consideration.

         (b) Treatment of Company Stock Options.

                  The Company shall take all actions necessary (including those
actions contemplated by Section 3.5 hereof) under the Company Stock Plans and
all agreements pursuant to which Company Stock Options were issued to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Section 2.3(b), to provide that such Company
Stock Options may be exercised pursuant to a "cashless" option exercise
procedure mutually acceptable to the Company and Liberty Media and to comply
with the covenant set forth in Section 7.4(j). At the Effective Time, all
outstanding options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under a Company
Stock Plan or any other contract, all of which are listed in Section 2.3(b)of
the Company Disclosure Schedule ("Company Stock Options"), whether or not then
immediately exercisable or "in the money," shall, without any further action on
the part of any holder thereof, be accelerated and become exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, each Company
Stock Option which remains unexercised (a "Carryover Option") shall be treated
as follows:

                                       11
<PAGE>   16
                  (i) Each Carryover Option granted pursuant to the
International Post Limited 1993 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "1993 Plan"), the
Video Services Corporation 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "1997 Plan") and
the Stock Option Agreement, dated as of February 15, 1994, between International
Post Limited (formerly International Post Group, Inc.), a Delaware corporation,
and Jeffrey J. Kaplan (the "Kaplan Agreement") shall be deemed, following the
Effective Time, to constitute an option to acquire that number of shares of
Class A Liberty Media Group Stock equal to (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock for which such Carryover Option was exercisable immediately prior
to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) 0.208. The per share exercise price of
each such Carryover Option shall be equal to the quotient obtained by dividing
(A) the product of (1) the per share exercise price of such Carryover Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (2) the number of shares
of Company Common Stock subject to such Carryover Option by (B) the number of
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock subject to such Carryover Option
immediately following the Effective Time.

                  (ii) All Carryover Options, except for Carryover Options
granted pursuant to the 1993 Plan or the Kaplan Agreement, shall terminate
immediately following the Effective Time with no consideration being paid
therefor, and shall thereafter no longer be exercisable for securities or other
assets or properties of the Company, the Surviving Entity Parent, Liberty Media
or any other Person.

                  All other terms and conditions of the Carryover Options shall
remain in effect, except as otherwise expressly provided herein. Promptly
following the execution of this Agreement, Liberty Media and the Company shall
agree upon the terms of a notice to be delivered to each holder of Company Stock
Options describing the treatment of Carryover Options as set forth above and
soliciting their consent to such treatment. The Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to obtain the consent of each holder of Company Stock Options to
such treatment prior to the Closing. Liberty Media represents and warrants that
all shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock issued upon the exercise of any
Carryover Option will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Parent
and Liberty Media shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
issuance of shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock issuable upon exercise
of any Carryover Options granted pursuant to the 1993 Plan to have been
registered, at or as promptly as reasonably practicable following the Effective
Time, pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or other
comparable form) under the Securities Act, and Parent and Liberty Media shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such
registration statement thereafter for so long as any Carryover Options remain
exercisable.

         (c) Conversion of Merger Sub Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Liberty
Media, the Company or the holders of any of their securities, each share of
capital stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into one share of the common stock, par value $.01 per share,
of the Surviving Entity.


                                       12

2.4      Exchange of Certificates.

         (a) Appointment of Exchange Agent; Exchange Pool. On or before the
Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall enter into an agreement (the
"Exchange Agent Agreement") with Boston Equiserve Trust Company, N.A. or, at
Parent's option, another exchange agent selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Company (the "Exchange Agent"), authorizing such Person to act
as exchange agent hereunder. At the Effective Time, Liberty Media shall deposit
with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of those Persons who immediately prior
to the Effective Time were the holders of Company Common Stock, cash in an
amount necessary to pay the Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 2.3(a).
Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of those Persons who immediately prior to the
Effective Time were the holders of Company Common Stock, certificates
representing a sufficient number of shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common
Stock required to effect the delivery of the Stock Consideration pursuant to
Section 2.3(a) (the cash and the certificates representing Class A Liberty Media
Group Common Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Section
2.4(a) and comprising the Merger Consideration being hereinafter referred to as
the "Exchange Pool"). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the
Exchange Pool in one or more bank accounts or in high-quality, short-term
investments, as directed by Liberty Media, on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments will be paid to Liberty Media. The
Exchange Pool shall not be used for any purpose except as provided in this
Agreement.

         (b) Letter of Transmittal. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the
"Certificates") whose shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration: (i) a notice of the effectiveness of the Merger and (ii) a letter
of transmittal (which shall state that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent) with instructions for use in effecting the
surrender and exchange of the Certificates. Such notice, letter of transmittal
and instructions shall contain such provisions and be in such form as Parent,
Liberty Media and the Company reasonably specify.

         (c) Exchange Procedure. Promptly following the surrender, in accordance
with such instructions, of a Certificate to the Exchange Agent (or such other
agent or agents as may be appointed by the Exchange Agent or Parent pursuant to
the Exchange Agent Agreement), together with such letter of transmittal (duly
executed) and any other documents required by such instructions or letter of
transmittal, the Exchange Agent shall, subject to Section 2.4(d), cause to be
distributed to the Person in whose name such Certificate shall have been issued
(i) a certificate registered in the name of such Person representing the number
of whole shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock constituting the Stock
Consideration issuable with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by the surrendered Certificate, (ii) payment by check of
the Cash Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by the surrendered Certificate, and (iii) and
payment made by check of any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares of Class
A Liberty Media Group Stock pursuant to Section 2.4(f). Each Certificate so
surrendered shall be canceled. No interest


                                       13
<PAGE>   18
will be paid to holders of Certificates with respect to any cash payable to such
holders pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.

         (d) Unregistered Transfers of Company Common Stock. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, certificates representing the Stock
Consideration may be issued to, and the Cash Consideration and any cash in lieu
of fractional shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock may be delivered to,
the transferee if the Certificate representing such Company Common Stock
surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with Section 2.4(c) is properly
endorsed for transfer or is accompanied by appropriate and properly endorsed
stock powers and is otherwise in proper form to effect such transfer, if the
Person requesting such transfer pays to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
taxes payable by reason of such transfer or establishes to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such taxes have been paid or are not required to be paid
and if such Person establishes to the satisfaction of Parent that such transfer
would not violate applicable Federal or state securities laws.

         (e) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. Subject to the DGCL, if any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed satisfactory to Parent and complying with any other
reasonable requirements imposed by Parent, the Exchange Agent will cause to be
delivered to such Person in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration (including any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Common Stock to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.4(f)) in respect thereof as determined in
accordance with this Article II. Parent may, in its discretion, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to give Parent a bond in
such reasonable sum as it may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against Parent or the Surviving Entity with respect to the Certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

         (f) No Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Class A Liberty Media
Group Stock shall be issued in the Merger. In lieu of any such fractional
shares, each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise have
been entitled to a fraction of a share of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock upon
surrender of Certificates for exchange pursuant to this Section 2.4 will be paid
an amount in cash (without interest) equal to such holder's proportionate
interest in the proceeds from the sale or sales in the open market by the
Exchange Agent, on behalf of all such holders, of the aggregate fractional
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock which, but for this Section 2.4(f),
would be issuable in the Merger. As soon as practicable following the Effective
Time, the Exchange Agent shall determine the excess of (i) the number of full
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock delivered to the Exchange Agent by
Parent over (ii) the aggregate number of full shares of Class A Liberty Media
Group Stock to be distributed to former holders of Company Common Stock (such
excess being herein called the "Excess Shares"). The Exchange Agent, as agent
for the former holders of Company Common Stock, shall sell the Excess Shares at
the prevailing prices on the NYSE as soon as practicable after the Closing. The
sales of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent shall be executed on the NYSE
through one or more member firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round lots
to the extent practicable. All commissions, transfer taxes and other
out-of-pocket transaction costs, if any, including the expenses and
compensation, if any, of the Exchange Agent, incurred in connection with such
sale of Excess Shares, shall be deducted from the proceeds otherwise


                                       14
<PAGE>   19
distributable to the holders of Company Common Stock. Until the proceeds of such
sale have been distributed to the former holders of Company Common Stock, the
Exchange Agent will hold such proceeds in trust for such former holders (the
"Fractional Fund"). As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount
of cash to be paid to former holders of Company Common Stock in lieu of any
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall make available in accordance with
this Agreement such amounts to such former holders.

         (g) No Dividends Before Surrender of Certificates. No dividends or
other distributions declared or made after the Effective Time with respect to
Class A Liberty Media Group Stock with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock represented thereby, until the
holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such Certificate as
provided herein. Following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be
paid to the record holder of the certificates representing whole shares of Class
A Liberty Media Group Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (i)
at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions,
if any, with a record date after the Effective Time and payable with respect to
such whole shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock between the Effective
Time and the time of such surrender, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date,
the amount of dividends or other distributions, if any, with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to surrender and with a payment date subsequent to
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Class A Liberty Media
Group Stock.

         (h) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock. The Merger
Consideration (together with cash paid in lieu of fractional shares) delivered
upon the surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock,
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Entity of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to Section 2.4(i),
if, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article
II.

         (i) Termination of Exchange Pool and Fractional Fund; Abandoned
Property Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Pool and the Fractional Fund (and any
dividends or other distributions with respect to such portion of the Exchange
Pool) which remains unclaimed by the former stockholders of the Company for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of
Parent, and any former stockholders of the Company shall, after such delivery,
look only to Parent for payment of their claim for the applicable Merger
Consideration including any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Class A Liberty
Media Group Stock (and any such dividends or other distributions). Neither
Parent, Liberty Media nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Class A Liberty Media Group Stock for any
Merger Consideration, for any dividends or distributions with respect thereto or
for any cash in lieu of fractional shares, which may be delivered to any public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

         (j) Appraisal Shares. Notwithstanding Sections 2.3(a)(i) and 2.4(f),
each share of Company Common Stock held of record immediately prior to the
Effective Time by a


                                       15
<PAGE>   20
stockholder of the Company that has not failed to perfect and has not
effectively withdrawn, surrendered, or lost appraisal rights under Section 262
of the DGCL as to such share (to the extent, if any, that such appraisal rights
are available under Section 262 of the DGCL) shall not be converted into and
represent the right to receive and shall not be exchangeable for the Merger
Consideration (including any payments of cash in lieu of fractional shares) as
provided in this Article II, and such stockholder shall not be entitled to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II (including any
payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares), and such stockholder shall be
entitled only to such appraisal rights as to such share, provided, however, that
if and when any such stockholder shall have failed to perfect such appraisal
rights or shall have effectively withdrawn, surrendered, or lost such appraisal
rights as to such share in accordance with the DGCL, then such share of Company
Common Stock shall be converted into and represent the right to receive and
shall be exchangeable for (to the fullest extent permitted under the DGCL, as of
the Effective Time) the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article II
(including any payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares), and such
stockholder shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in
this Article II (including any payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares and
any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 2.4(g)) in exchange for
and upon the surrender of the Certificate evidencing such share in accordance
with this Agreement.

2.5 Changes in Class A Liberty Media Group Stock. If, prior to the Effective
Time, the Class A Liberty Media Group Stock shall be recapitalized, redeemed or
reclassified or Parent shall effect any stock dividend, stock split, or reverse
stock split of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock or shall otherwise effect any
transaction that changes the shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock into
any other securities (including securities of another corporation), or shall
make any other dividend or distribution on the shares of Class A Liberty Media
Group Stock (other than normal quarterly cash dividends as the same may be
adjusted from time to time), then the Stock Exchange Ratio, the terms of the
foregoing exchanges and the terms of the conversion of any Carryover Options as
provided in Section 2.3(b) will, as appropriate, be adjusted to reflect such
split, combination, transaction, dividend or other distribution or change.

2.6 Capital Contribution to Liberty Media. As soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent and Liberty
Media shall cause the Post-Merger Restructuring Transactions described in
Exhibit 2.6, as the same may be modified or amended by mutual agreement of the
parties, to be consummated.

                                   ARTICLE III
                                 CERTAIN ACTIONS

3.1 Stockholder Meeting. The Company and its Board of Directors (the "Company
Board") shall take all action necessary in accordance with applicable law, the
requirements of the American Stock Exchange and the Company's Restated
Certificate of Incorporation (the "Company Charter") and Bylaws (the "Company
Bylaws") to duly call and hold, as soon as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, a meeting of the Company's stockholders (the "Special Meeting") for the
purpose of considering and voting upon the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger contemplated hereby (the "Merger Proposal"). The only
matters the Company shall propose to be acted on by the Company's stockholders
at the Special Meeting shall be the Merger Proposal and related matters
incidental to the consummation of the Merger


                                       16
<PAGE>   21
and, if so determined by the Company and with the consent of Liberty Media
(which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), such other matters as are
customarily presented to stockholders at an annual meeting. Subject to Section
7.5(c), the Company Board will recommend that the Company's stockholders vote in
favor of approval of the Merger Proposal and include such recommendation in the
Proxy Statement, and the Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of such approval and to secure
the vote of stockholders of the Company required by the DGCL, the Company
Charter and the Company Bylaws to effect the Merger. The Company shall not
require any vote greater than a majority of the votes entitled to be cast by the
holders of the issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock for
approval of the Merger Proposal.

3.2 Registration Statement and Other Commission Filings. As soon as reasonably
practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Parent, Liberty Media and the
Company shall cooperate in the preparation of, and the Company shall file
confidentially with the Commission, a preliminary proxy statement in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to each of Parent, Liberty Media and the
Company, and, following resolution of comments, if any, of the Commission on the
preliminary proxy statement, Liberty Media and Parent shall prepare and Parent
shall file with the Commission a registration statement on Form S-4 (the
"Registration Statement"), containing a form of prospectus that includes such
proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, if applicable) registering under
the Securities Act the issuance of the shares of Class A Liberty Media Group
Stock issuable upon conversion of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger.
Each of Parent, Liberty Media and the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to respond to any comments of the Commission and to have the
Registration Statement declared effective as promptly as practicable after such
filing and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the proxy statement as filed with the Commission and as thereafter amended or
supplemented to be cleared by the Commission and mailed to the Company's
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Registration Statement becomes
effective (such proxy statement in the definitive form mailed to the Company's
stockholders, as thereafter amended or supplemented, being referred to as the
"Proxy Statement"). The Company, Liberty Media and Parent will notify each other
party promptly of the receipt of any comments from the Commission or its staff
or any other government officials and of any request by the Commission or its
staff for amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement, the Proxy
Statement or any other filing or for additional information, and will supply the
other parties with copies of all correspondence between it and any of its
representatives, on the one hand, and the Commission or its staff or any other
government officials on the other hand, with respect to the Registration
Statement, the Proxy Statement, the Merger or any filing with the Commission
relating thereto. Whenever any party hereto becomes aware of any event that is
required to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement,
the Registration Statement or any other filing with the Commission in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, such party shall
promptly inform the other parties of such occurrence and cooperate in the prompt
filing with the Commission or its staff or any other governmental officials,
and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company, of such amendment or supplement,
which shall comply in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The Company, Parent and Liberty Media shall
each promptly provide the others (or their respective counsel) copies of all
filings made by such party with any Governmental Entity in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.


                                       17
<PAGE>   22
3.3 Identification of Rule 145 Affiliates. Within 30 days after the execution of
this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent and Liberty Media a letter
identifying all Persons who the Company knows are or who the Company has reason
to believe may be, as of the date of the Special Meeting, "affiliates" of the
Company for purposes of Rule 145 under the Securities Act. The Company will
supplement such letter, if applicable, with the name and address of any other
Person subsequently identified by either Parent or the Company, as the case may
be, as a Person who may be deemed to be such an affiliate; provided, however,
that no such Person identified by the Company shall remain on such list of
affiliates if the Company shall receive from Parent, on or before the date of
the Special Meeting, an opinion of outside counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to the effect that such Person is not such an affiliate. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each Person who is identified as
an "affiliate" in the letter referred to above (as so supplemented) to deliver
to Parent, on or prior to the Closing Date, a written agreement, in
substantially the form annexed hereto as Exhibit 3.3 (each a "Rule 145
Agreement"). Parent shall not be required to maintain the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or any other registration statement under the Securities
Act for the purposes of resale of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock received by
such "affiliates" in the Merger.

3.4 Reasonable Efforts.

         (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including
Section 7.4 hereof) and applicable law, and (with respect to Parent) subject to
the last proviso of the following sentence, each of the parties hereto shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions
and to do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably necessary, proper or
advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as soon as reasonably practicable (or, with respect to ministerial
actions required of Parent or its directors, officers, employees or agents,
promptly), including such actions or things as any other party hereto may
reasonably request in order to cause any of the conditions to such party's
obligation to consummate such transactions specified in Article VIII to be fully
satisfied. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto shall (and each shall cause its directors, officers and Subsidiaries, and
use its reasonable efforts to cause its Affiliates, employees, agents,
attorneys, accountants and representatives, to) consult and fully cooperate with
and provide reasonable assistance to each other in (A) the preparation and
filing with the Commission of the Registration Statement, the preliminary proxy
statement referred to in Section 3.2, the Proxy Statement and any necessary
amendments or supplements to any of the foregoing; (B) seeking to have such
Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission as soon as
reasonably practicable after filing; (C) taking such actions as may reasonably
be required under applicable state securities or blue sky laws in connection
with the issuance of the Stock Consideration; (D) using commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all required consents, approvals, waivers, licenses, permits,
authorizations, registrations, qualifications, or other permission or action by,
and to give all required notices to and to make all required filings with and
applications and submissions to, any Governmental Entity or other Person, in
each case required in order to cause any of the conditions to each other party's
obligation to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated hereby to
be fully satisfied; (E) filing all pre-merger notification and report forms
required under the Hart-Scott Act and responding to any requests for additional
information made by any Governmental Entity pursuant to the Hart-Scott Act; (F)
using commercially reasonable efforts (which in the case of


                                       18
<PAGE>   23
Parent do not require the commencement of litigation) to cause the lifting of
any permanent or preliminary injunction or restraining order or other similar
order issued or entered by any court or other Governmental Entity (an
"Injunction") of any type referred to in Section 8.2(d), 8.3(d) or 8.4(d); (G)
providing all such information about such party, its Subsidiaries and its
officers, directors, partners and Affiliates, and making all applications and
filings, as may be necessary or reasonably requested in connection with any of
the foregoing; and (H) in general, using commercially reasonable efforts to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby; provided,
however, that in making any such filing and in order to obtain any consent,
approval, waiver, license, permit, authorization, registration, qualification,
or other permission or action or the lifting of any Injunction referred to in
this sentence, (x) the Company, Liberty Media, Parent and their respective
Affiliates shall not be required to (and without the prior written consent of
Liberty Media and Parent, the Company and its Affiliates shall not): (i) pay any
consideration; (ii) surrender, modify or amend in any substantive respect any
License or Contract (including this Agreement), (iii) hold separately (in trust
or otherwise), divest itself of, or otherwise rearrange the composition of, any
of its assets, (iv) agree to any limitations on any such Person's freedom of
action with respect to future acquisitions of assets or with respect to any
existing or future business or activities or on the enjoyment of the full rights
of ownership, possession and use of any asset now owned or hereafter acquired by
any such Person, or (v) agree to any of the foregoing or any other conditions or
requirements of any Governmental Entity or other Person that are materially
adverse or burdensome; (y) Parent shall not be required to take any action
pursuant to the foregoing if the taking of such action is reasonably likely to
result in the imposition of a condition or restriction of the type referred to
in Section 8.3(e); and (z) Liberty Media and the Company recognize that Parent
may allocate resources in whatever manner it reasonably deems appropriate; and
provided, further, that Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to
take any such action, or any other action pursuant to this Section 3.4, except
to the extent that such action is required by statute, rule or regulation to be
taken by or in the name of Parent or such Subsidiary (as opposed to by or in the
name of Liberty Media or the Company or a Subsidiary thereof) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, in such event, Parent (or
such Subsidiary of Parent) shall be required only to make filings and statements
of fact and shall not under any circumstances be required to commit or be
committed to take or refrain from taking any action or be subject to any
restriction that relates to any business, asset, liability, operation or
employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries. Prior to making any application
to or filing with any Governmental Entity or other Person in connection with
this Agreement, each party shall provide the other party with drafts thereof and
afford the other party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such drafts.

         (b) The Company will take all reasonable steps to (i) exempt the Merger
from the requirements of any applicable state takeover law and (ii) assist in
any challenge by Parent or Liberty Media to the validity or applicability to the
Merger of any state takeover law.

         (c) Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to affect the ability of
Parent at any time to effect the distribution, if any, to holders of Class A
Liberty Media Group Stock and Class B Liberty Media Group Stock of all or any
portion of, or any interest in, the assets comprising the Liberty Media Group,
the redemption, if any, of all or any portion of the Class A Liberty Media Group
Stock and Class B Liberty Media Group Stock or any similar transaction. If at
any time prior to the consummation of the Merger, Parent has effected a
distribution to holders of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock and Class B Liberty
Media Group Stock of all of its interest


                                       19
<PAGE>   24
in the assets comprising the Liberty Media Group at such time (the "Liberty
Interest"), a redemption of all of the Class A Liberty Media Group Stock and
Class B Liberty Media Group Stock in exchange for the Liberty Interest (any such
action, a "Liberty Event") or a similar transaction, the parties agree that
Parent shall automatically be fully released and discharged from all of its
obligations hereunder and the Company and Liberty Media will amend this
Agreement as appropriate to provide that (i) the Company will be acquired by
Liberty Media or such other publicly-traded corporation that at such time holds,
directly or indirectly, the Liberty Interest (the "New Parent") by means of the
merger of a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of New Parent into the Company, with
the Company as the surviving entity in such merger (an "Alternative Merger"),
(ii) in lieu of the Stock Consideration issuable pursuant to this Agreement in
the Merger, the stockholders of the Company will be entitled to receive, per
share of Company Common Stock cancelled in the Alternative Merger, that number
of shares or fraction of a share (subject to Section 2.4(f)) of the class and
series of common stock of New Parent received by holders of shares of Class A
Liberty Media Group Stock in the Liberty Event equal to (x) 0.104 (subject to
the adjustments set forth in Section 2.5) multiplied by (y) the number of
shares, or fraction of a share, of such class or series of common stock of New
Parent distributed in respect of, or delivered in redemption of (as applicable),
one share of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock in connection with the Liberty
Event (the "Alternative Consideration"), and (iii) each Carryover Option will
become exercisable for that number of shares or fraction of a share of the class
and series of common stock of New Parent received by holders of shares of Class
A Liberty Media Group Stock in the Liberty Event equal to (x) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock for which such Carryover Option was exercisable
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the product of (A)
0.208 (subject to the adjustments set forth in Section 2.5) multiplied by (B)
the number of shares, or fraction of a share, of such class or series of common
stock of New Parent distributed in respect of, or delivered in redemption of (as
applicable), one share of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock in connection with
the Liberty Event (and (1) the per share exercise price of each such Carryover
Option will likewise be appropriately adjusted and (2) each Carryover Option,
other than Carryover Options granted pursuant to the 1993 Plan or the Kaplan
Agreement, will terminate immediately following the effective time of the
Alternative Merger). Liberty Media and the Company will negotiate in good faith
such other revisions to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as are
appropriate to provide for the Alternative Merger as set forth in the preceding
sentence.

         (d) Promptly following the occurrence of a Liberty Event, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the opinion of an
investment bank of nationally recognized standing to the effect that the
Alternative Consideration to be received by the stockholders of the Company in
the Alternative Merger is equivalent in value to the Stock Consideration that
would have been received by the stockholders of the Company in the Merger had
such Liberty Event not occurred (an "Equivalency Opinion"). Receipt of an
Equivalency Opinion will be a condition to the Company's obligation to
consummate the Alternative Merger, subject to the remaining provisions of this
Section 3.4(d). At any time on or after the tenth day following the satisfaction
or waiver of all conditions to the closing of the Alternative Merger except for
the receipt of an Equivalency Opinion and except for conditions to be satisfied
on the Closing Date, New Parent may, but shall not be required to, elect to
acquire the Company for cash (a "Cash Election"). If New Parent makes a Cash
Election (i) the Company will be acquired by New Parent by means of the merger
of a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of New Parent into the Company, with the
Company as the surviving entity in such merger (a "Cash


                                       20
<PAGE>   25
Merger"), (ii) receipt of an Equivalency Opinion will not be a condition to the
Company's obligation to consummate a Cash Merger, (iii) in lieu of the Stock
Consideration issuable pursuant to this Agreement in the Merger or the
Alternative Consideration, the stockholders of the Company will be entitled to
receive, per share of Company Common Stock cancelled in the Cash Merger, $2.75
in cash as additional Cash Consideration, and (iv) each Carryover Option will
become exercisable for an amount of cash equal to (x) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock for which such Carryover Option was exercisable immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) $5.50 (and (1) the per share
exercise price of each such Carryover Option will likewise be appropriately
adjusted and (2) each Carryover Option, other than Carryover Options granted
pursuant to the 1993 Plan or the Kaplan Agreement, will terminate immediately
following the effective time of the Cash Merger). New Parent and the Company
will negotiate in good faith such other revisions to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement as are appropriate to provide for a Cash Merger as set forth in
the preceding sentence.

3.5 Company Stock Option and Other Plans. Promptly following the mailing of the
Proxy Statement, the Company shall cause a notice (which shall include, without
limitation, the information contained in Section 2.3(b) hereof) to be sent to
each holder of Company Stock Options, whether vested or unvested, in such form
as is reasonably agreed upon by the Company, Parent and Liberty Media.

3.6 Expenses. Except as otherwise may be provided in this Agreement, whether or
not the Merger is consummated, as between the Company, on one hand, and Liberty
Media, on the other hand, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the
party incurring such cost or expense, except that the costs and expenses
incurred in connection with printing and mailing the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement (and any amendment or supplement thereto) and any
prospectus included in the Registration Statement (and any amendment or
supplement thereto) and the costs of filing under the Hart-Scott Act shall be
borne one-half by Liberty Media and one-half by the Company. The filing fee
payable to the Commission in connection with the filing of the Registration
Statement shall be paid by Liberty Media. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this
Agreement is terminated by a party (the "non-breaching party") as a result of a
material willful breach by the other party (the "breaching party") of its
covenants or agreements contained herein or the representations and warranties
made by it herein, in addition to all other rights and remedies that may be
available to the non-breaching party, the breaching party shall reimburse the
non-breaching party for all reasonably documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

         practice, or other agreement, obligation, commitment or concession of
         any nature to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is a
         party, by which the Company, any Subsidiary of the Company or any of
         their respective assets or properties is bound or affected or pursuant
         to which the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company is entitled to
         any rights or benefits (including the Licenses) (collectively,
         "Contracts");

                  (2) assuming the approval of the Merger Proposal by the

         Subsidiaries or over their respective properties or businesses;

other than, in the case of clause (1) above, any such violations or failures to
obtain any Contract Consents or to make any Contract Notices that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

         (b) No event has occurred and no condition exists that, upon notice or
the passage of time (or both), would constitute a Violation under any of the
items listed in clauses (1), (2) or (3)


                                       25
<PAGE>   30

Adverse Effect.

4.7 Reports.

         (a) The Company has made available to Parent and Liberty Media true and
complete copies (including all amendments thereto) of its (i) Annual Reports on
Form 10-K for all fiscal years since January 1, 1996, as filed with the

will furnish to Parent and Liberty Media copies of any reports and registration

reasonable amount of time prior to the filing thereof. As of their respective
dates, the Company SEC Reports (or the Interim SEC Reports, as the case may be)
complied or will comply, as the case may be, in all material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
applicable to such reports and registration statements. As of their respective
dates, the Company SEC Reports (or the Interim SEC Reports, as the case may be)
did not and will not, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were, or will be, made, not misleading.

         (b) The audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited interim
financial statements of the Company included in the Company SEC Reports (or to
be included in the Interim SEC Reports, as the case may be) comply as to form in
all material respects with applicable accounting requirements of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and with the published rules and
regulations of the Commission with respect thereto. The financial statements and
the condensed financial statements, as applicable, included in the Company SEC

have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis (except
as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (ii) present fairly, in
all material respects, the financial position of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the results of their operations and
cash flows for the periods then ended subject, in the case of the unaudited
interim financial statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and any other
adjustments described therein and the fact that certain information and notes
have been condensed or omitted in accordance with the Exchange Act, and (iii)
are in all material respects in agreement with the books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries.

         (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries keep proper accounting records in
which all material assets and liabilities, and all material transactions, of the
Company and its Subsidiaries are recorded in conformity with applicable
accounting principles. No part of the Company's or

under the control of a Person who is not an employee of the Company or such
Subsidiary (other than the Company's independent auditors and outside legal
counsel).

4.8 Absence of Certain Developments. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports filed with the Commission prior to the date hereof or in Section 4.8 of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, and except for the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, since June 30, 1999 the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their business only in the ordinary and usual course in accordance
with past practice, and:

         (a) there have not occurred any events, changes or conditions
(including the incurrence of any liabilities of any nature, whether or not
accrued, contingent or otherwise) that have had, or are reasonably likely in the
future to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect; and

         (b) neither the Company nor any Subsidiary of the Company has taken any
action that would have been prohibited under Section 7.4 hereof had the
prohibitions imposed by such section been in effect at such time.

4.9 Compliance with Law.

         (a) Except as set forth in Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in violation of any
laws, ordinances, governmental rules or regulations to which it is subject,
including, without limitation, laws or regulations relating to the environment
or to occupational health and safety. No expenditures material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole are or will be required in order to cause
the current operations or properties of such entities to comply with any such
laws, ordinances, governmental rules or regulations and except as set forth in
Section 4.9 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received notice of violation of any law, ordinance,
governmental rule or regulation and except as set forth in Section 4.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no investigation or review by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is pending or, to
the best of the Company's knowledge, threatened, nor has any Governmental Entity
indicated an intention to conduct any such investigation or review.

         (b) Neither the Company or any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the
Company's knowledge, any of the officers, directors, employees, agents or other
representatives of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other business
entity or enterprise with which the Company or any Subsidiary is or has been
affiliated or associated, has, directly or indirectly, made or authorized any
payment, contribution or gift of money, property, or services, whether or not in
contravention of applicable law, (i) as a kickback or bribe to any Person or
(ii) to any political organization, or the holder of or any aspirant to any
elective or appointive public office except for personal political contributions
not involving the direct or indirect use of funds of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries.

         (c) The Company and its Subsidiaries hold, and Section 4.9 of the
Company Disclosure Schedule lists, all licenses, permits, rights of way,
easements, franchises, ordinances,


                                       27
<PAGE>   32
certificates, variances, exemptions, concessions, leases, instruments, orders
and approvals, governmental authorizations, domestic or foreign, necessary to
the ownership of their property or to the conduct of their respective
businesses, which if violated or not obtained might have a Material Adverse
Effect (collectively, the "Licenses"). Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary
has finally been denied any application for any such Licenses. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, the Company and its Subsidiaries, (i) have all
Licenses from Governmental Entities required for the operation of the facilities
being operated on the date hereof by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) have duly and currently filed all reports and other information required to
be filed by any other Governmental Entity in connection with such Licenses and
(iii) are not in violation of any of such Licenses, other than the lack of
Licenses, delays in filing reports or possible violations that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and, insofar as can reasonably be foreseen by the
Company, in the future are not reasonably likely to have, a Material Adverse
Effect.

         (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not made any misstatements of
fact, or omitted to disclose any fact, to any Governmental Entity, or taken or
failed to take any action, which misstatements or omissions, actions or failures
to act, individually or in the aggregate, subject or would subject any Licenses
held by the Company to revocation or failure to renew, except where such
revocation or failure to renew, individually or in the aggregate, does not and
would not be reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect.

4.10 Litigation. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports or in Section
4.10 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no legal action, suit,
arbitration or other legal, administrative or other governmental investigation,
inquiry or proceeding (whether federal, state, local or foreign) pending or, to
the best of the Company's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company or any of their respective properties, assets
or businesses which, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. To the best of

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                       ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS

7.1 Access to Information Concerning Properties and Records. Upon reasonable
notice, the Company shall (and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to) afford
to the officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized
representatives of Parent and Liberty Media reasonable access during normal
business hours to all its properties, personnel, books and records and furnish
promptly to such Persons such financial and operating data and other information
concerning its business, properties, personnel and affairs as such Persons shall
from time to time reasonably request and instruct the officers, directors,
employees, counsel and financial advisors of the Company to discuss the business
operations, affairs and assets of the Company and otherwise fully cooperate with
the other party in its investigation of the business of the Company. Parent and
Liberty Media agree that they will not, and will cause their respective
officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other authorized representatives
not to, use any information obtained pursuant to this Section 7.1 for any
purpose unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No
investigation pursuant to this Section 7.1 will affect any representation or
warranty given by the Company to Parent or Liberty Media hereunder.

7.2 Confidentiality. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the party
disclosing (or whose Representatives disclosed) the same (a "disclosing party"),
each party (a "receiving party") shall, and shall cause its Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, agents, counsel, financial advisors and
controlling Persons (such Affiliates and other Persons with respect to any party
being collectively referred to as such party's "Representatives") to, (i) keep
all Confidential Information of the disclosing party confidential and not
disclose or reveal any such Confidential Information to any Person other than
those Representatives of the receiving party who are participating in effecting
the transactions contemplated hereby or who otherwise need to know such
Confidential Information, (ii) use such Confidential Information only in
connection with consummating the transactions contemplated hereby and enforcing
the receiving party's rights hereunder, and (iii) not use Confidential
Information in any manner detrimental to the disclosing party. In the event that
a receiving party is requested pursuant to, or required by, applicable law or
regulation or by legal process to disclose any Confidential Information of the
disclosing party, the receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with
prompt notice of such request(s) to enable the disclosing party to seek an
appropriate protective order. A party's obligations hereunder with respect to
Confidential Information that (i) is disclosed to a third party with the
disclosing party's written approval, (ii) is required to be produced under order
of a court of competent jurisdiction or other similar requirements of a
governmental agency, or (iii) is required to be disclosed by applicable law or
regulation, will, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above to the
receiving party's compliance with the preceding sentence, cease to the extent of
the disclosure so consented to or required, except to the extent otherwise
provided by the terms of such consent or covered by a protective order. If a
receiving party uses a degree of care to prevent disclosure of the Confidential
Information that is at least as great as the care it normally takes to preserve
its own information of a similar nature, it shall not be liable for any
disclosure that occurs despite the exercise of that degree of care, and in no
event shall a receiving party be liable for any indirect, punitive, special or
consequential damages unless such disclosure resulted from its willful
misconduct or gross negligence in which event it shall be liable in damages for
the disclosing party's lost profits resulting directly and solely from such
disclosure;

                                       47
<PAGE>   52
provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent will not be liable
under any circumstances for damages other than direct damages (and not lost
profits or indirect, special, punitive or consequential damages) resulting
directly and solely from such wrongful disclosure by Parent. In the event this
Agreement is terminated, each party shall, if so requested by any other party,
promptly return or destroy all of the Confidential Information of such other
party, including all copies, reproductions, summaries, analyses or extracts
thereof or based thereon in the possession of the receiving party or its
Representatives; provided, however, that the receiving party shall not be
required to return or cause to be returned summaries, analyses or extracts
prepared by it or its Representatives, but shall destroy (or cause to be
destroyed) the same upon request of the disclosing party.

                  For purposes of this Section 7.2, "Confidential Information"
of a party means all confidential or proprietary information about such party
that is furnished by it or its Representatives to the other party or the other
party's Representatives, regardless of the manner in which it is furnished.
"Confidential Information" does not include, however, information which (a) has
been or in the future is published or is now or in the future is otherwise in
the public domain through no fault of the receiving party or its
Representatives, (b) was available to the receiving party or its Representatives
on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party, (c)
becomes available to the receiving party or its Representatives on a
non-confidential basis from a Person other than the disclosing party or its
Representatives who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with
the disclosing party or its Representatives, or is not otherwise prohibited from
transmitting the information to the receiving party or its Representatives, or
(d) is independently developed by the receiving party or its Representatives
through Persons who have not had, either directly or indirectly, access to or
knowledge of such information.

7.3 Public Announcements. The Company, Liberty Media and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each
party hereto shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that all press releases and
other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be consistent with such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise
required by applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any securities exchange or the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc., each party shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to consult with, and use commercially reasonable efforts to accommodate the
comments of the other parties before issuing any press release or otherwise
making any public statement with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby.

contemplated by the Company Transaction Documents (copies of which have been

7.5      No Solicitation.

         (a) The Company will notify Parent and Liberty Media immediately, but
in any event within 24 hours, if any proposals, inquiries or expressions of
interest are received by, any


                                       51
<PAGE>   56
information is requested from, or any negotiations or discussions are sought to
be initiated or continued with the Company or its representatives, in each case
in connection with any Extraordinary Transaction (as defined below) or the
possibility or consideration by a third party of making a Extraordinary
Transaction ("Extraordinary Transaction Interest") indicating, in connection
with such notice, the name of the Person indicating such Extraordinary
Transaction Interest, the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers and
the nature of any inquiries or expressions of interest. The Company agrees that
it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect
to any Extraordinary Transaction Interest. The Company agrees that it will take
the necessary steps promptly to inform the Persons referred to in the first
sentence hereof of the obligations undertaken in this Section 7.5. The Company
agrees that it shall keep Parent and Liberty Media informed, on a current basis,
of the status and terms of any Extraordinary Transaction Interest. As used in
this Agreement, "Extraordinary Transaction" shall mean any tender or exchange
offer involving the Company, any proposal for a merger, consolidation or other
business combination involving the Company, any proposal or offer to acquire in
any manner a greater than 15% equity interest in, or a significant portion of
the business or assets of, the Company (other than immaterial or insubstantial
assets or inventory in the ordinary course of business or assets held for sale),
any proposal or offer with respect to any recapitalization or restructuring with
respect to the Company or any proposal or offer with respect to any other
transaction similar to any of the foregoing with respect to the Company other
than pursuant to the transactions to be effected pursuant to this Agreement.

         (b) The Company will not, and will use its best efforts to ensure that
its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants
and other agents do not, directly or indirectly: (i) initiate, solicit or
encourage, or take any action to facilitate (including by the furnishing of
information) the making of, any offer or proposal which constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to any Extraordinary Transaction, (ii) enter into any
agreement with respect to any Extraordinary Transaction, or (iii) in the event
of an unsolicited Extraordinary Transaction for the Company, engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or provide any information or data to, any
Person (other than Parent, Liberty Media, Merger Sub, any of their Affiliates or
Representatives and except for information which has been previously publicly
disseminated by the Company) relating to any Extraordinary Transaction.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, the
Company may furnish information concerning its business, properties or assets to
any Person pursuant to appropriate confidentiality agreements, and may negotiate
and participate in discussions and negotiations with such Person concerning a
Extraordinary Transaction (provided that the Company shall not agree to any
exclusive right to negotiate with the Company) if (x) such entity or group has,
without the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants or other agents having taken any action
prohibited by Section 7.5(b) of this Agreement following the date of this
Agreement, submitted a bona fide written proposal to the Company relating to any
such transaction that the Company Board determines, in good faith, after
receiving written advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation is more favorable to the Company and its stockholders than the
transactions contemplated hereby (taking into account all relevant factors), and
for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed or which, in the
good faith judgment of the Company Board, is reasonably capable of being
obtained by such entity or group and (y) in the good faith opinion

                                       52
<PAGE>   57
of the Company Board, the failure to provide such information or access or to
engage in such discussions or negotiations would cause the Company Board to
breach its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under applicable law
(an Extraordinary Transaction which satisfies clauses (x) and (y) being referred
to herein as a "Superior Proposal"). The Company shall within one business day
following a determination that such Extraordinary Transaction is a Superior
Proposal notify Parent and Liberty Media of the receipt of the same. The Company
shall promptly provide to Parent and Liberty Media any nonpublic information
regarding the Company provided to any other party which was not previously
provided to Parent and Liberty Media. If the Company Board determines in good
faith that the fiduciary duties of the Company Board so require, the Company
Board may (subject to this and the following sentences) inform the Company's
stockholders that it no longer believes that the transactions contemplated
hereby are advisable, and that it no longer recommends approval of the Merger (a
"Subsequent Determination"), but only at a time that is after the fifth business
day following Parent's and Liberty Media's receipt of written notice advising
Parent and Liberty Media that the Company Board has received a Superior Proposal
specifying the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (and
including a copy thereof with all accompanying documentation), identifying the
Person making such Superior Proposal and stating that it intends to make a
Subsequent Determination. If such five-day notice overlaps with the scheduled
Special Meeting, the Company shall adjourn the Special Meeting so as to permit
compliance with such five-day notice period. After providing such notice, the
Company shall provide a reasonable opportunity to Parent and Liberty Media to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement and/or any
of the Company Transaction Documents as would enable the Company Board to
proceed with its recommendation to its stockholders without a Subsequent
Determination. At any time after five business days following notification to
Parent and Liberty Media of the Company's intent to do so and if the Company has
otherwise complied with the terms of this Section 7.5(c), the Company Board may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (iv) of Section 9.1 and enter into
an agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, provided that the Company
shall, concurrently with terminating this Agreement pursuant to such clause, pay
or cause to be paid to Liberty Media the Termination Fee (as defined in Section
9.2 hereof). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, so long as
this Agreement has not previously been terminated in accordance with its terms,
the Company shall submit the Merger Proposal to its stockholders pursuant to
Section 3.1 hereof, whether or not the Company Board makes a Subsequent
Determination; provided that, if the Company Board has made a Subsequent
Determination, it may withdraw its recommendation to stockholders that they vote
in favor of the Merger Proposal.

         (d) Except as set forth in Section 7.5(c), neither the Company Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw or modify, or propose to withdraw
or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent and Liberty Media, the approval or
recommendation by the Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement, the
other Company Transaction Documents, and the transactions contemplated hereby
and (ii) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend, any
Extraordinary Transaction or (iii) enter into any agreement with respect to any
Extraordinary Transaction.

         (e) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or
the Company Board from (i) taking, and disclosing to the Company's stockholders,
a position with respect to a Extraordinary Transaction pursuant to Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii)

                                       53
<PAGE>   58
making any disclosure to the Company's stockholders that the Company Board
determines, in good faith and upon exercise of its reasonable judgment after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the
failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable law.

7.6 Actions by Merger Sub. In its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub
and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to approve and adopt the Merger Proposal and to take all corporate
action necessary on its part to consummate the Merger and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

7.7 Listing. Each party hereto agrees to use its reasonable efforts to cause the
shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock to be issued in the Merger to be
authorized for listing on the NYSE, subject to official notice of issuance, and
to cause the shares of Class A Liberty Media Group Stock issuable upon the
exercise of Carryover Options to be listed on the NYSE.

7.8 Convertible Securities. The Company agrees to take such actions as are
necessary to ensure that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, all rights to
exercise, convert or exchange any Convertible Securities, whether or not issued
under any stock option or similar plans of the Company or any Subsidiary, will
have been exercised by the applicable holders of such Convertible Securities or
the rights of the applicable holders thereof to so exercise, convert or exchange
such Convertible Securities following the Effective Time shall have been
canceled, terminated or otherwise rendered null, void and of no further effect,
except in any such case as otherwise provided for herein with respect to any
Carryover Options. Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall be deemed to affect any of
the obligations of the Company pursuant to Section 7.4 including, without
limitation, clause (g) thereof.

7.9 Voting Agreement. Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Voting Agreement, a copy of the form of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit 7.9, is being executed by the parties identified on the signature
page thereto.

7.10     Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Insurance.

         (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless the present and former officers and
directors of the Company and any individual who is or was serving at the request
of the Company as an officer or director of another entity that is subject to
the registration obligations of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act (each, an
"Indemnified Party" and together, the "Indemnified Parties") (and shall also,
subject to Section 7.10(b), advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent
permitted under the DGCL, provided that the individual to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such individual is not entitled to indemnification), against (i)
all losses, costs, expenses, claims, damages, judgments or liabilities arising
out of, or in connection with, any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation based in whole or in part on the fact that the Indemnified Party
is or was an officer or director of the Company, or is or was serving at the
request of the Company as an officer or director of another entity that is
subject to the registration obligations of Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act,
pertaining to any matter existing or occurring before or at the Effective Time
and whether asserted or claimed before, at or after, the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Liabilities") and (ii)

all Indemnified Liabilities based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or
in part out of, or pertaining to this Agreement, the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in each case to the fullest extent
permitted under the DGCL (notwithstanding the Charter, Bylaws or similar
organizational documents of the Company, the Surviving Entity, Parent or Liberty
Media); provided, however, that such indemnification shall be provided only to
the extent any directors' and officers' liability insurance policy of the
Company or its Subsidiaries does not provide coverage and actual payment
thereunder with respect to the matters that would otherwise be subject to
indemnification hereunder (it being understood that the Surviving Entity shall,
subject to Section 7.10(b), advance expenses on a current basis as provided in
this paragraph (a) notwithstanding such insurance coverage to the extent that
payments thereunder have not yet been made, in which case the Surviving Entity
shall be entitled to repayment of such advances from the proceeds of such
insurance coverage). All rights to indemnification, including provisions
relating to advances of expenses incurred in defense of any action, suit or
proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (each, a
"Claim"), existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Company's Charter or Bylaws or pursuant to other agreements, or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws or similar documents of any of the Company's
Subsidiaries, as in effect as of the date hereof, with respect to matters
occurring through the Effective Time, shall survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of not less than three years from
the Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any Claim asserted, made or commenced within such period shall
continue until the final disposition of such Claim. The Surviving Entity shall
maintain in effect for not less than three years after the Effective Time the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company and the Company's Subsidiaries with respect to matters occurring
prior to or at the Effective Time; provided, however, that (i) the Surviving
Entity may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage containing
terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties
with an insurance company or companies, the claims paying ability of which is
substantially equivalent to the claims paying ability of the insurance company
or companies providing currently such insurance coverage for directors and
officers of the Company, and (ii) the Surviving Entity shall not be required to
pay an annual premium for such insurance in excess of one and one-half times the
last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, but in such case shall
purchase as much coverage as possible for such amount.

         (b) If any Claim relating hereto or to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement is commenced before the Effective Time, the Company, Liberty
Media and the Surviving Entity hereto agree to cooperate and use their
respective reasonable efforts to vigorously defend against and respond thereto.
Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph (a) of
this Section 7.10, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time), shall
promptly notify Liberty Media and the Company or the Surviving Entity thereof
(but the failure so to notify shall not relieve the Company, Liberty Media or
the Surviving Entity from any liability which it may have under this Section
7.10 except to the extent such failure materially prejudices such party),
whereupon Liberty Media or the Surviving Entity shall have the right, from and
after the Effective Time, to assume from such Indemnified Party and control the
defense thereof on behalf of such Indemnified Party, and upon such assumption,
the Surviving Entity shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any
legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by
such Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof..Notwithstanding

                                       55
<PAGE>   60
the foregoing, if counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are
issues which raise conflicts of interest between Liberty Media or the Surviving
Entity and the Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain separate
counsel and the Company or the Surviving Entity shall pay or cause to be paid
all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; provided that neither Liberty
Media nor the Surviving Entity shall be obligated pursuant to this Section
7.10(b) to pay or cause to be paid for more than one firm or counsel to
represent all Indemnified Parties in any jurisdiction unless there is, under
applicable standards of professional conduct, a conflict on any significant
issue between the positions of any two or more Indemnified Parties. Neither
Liberty Media nor the Surviving Entity shall be liable for any settlement
effected without its prior written consent, which consent, however, shall not be
unreasonably withheld, provided that neither Liberty Media nor the Surviving
Entity shall be obliged in any event to consent to any settlement or proposed
settlement which would impose any obligation upon Parent, Liberty Media, the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective Affiliates other than an obligation
on the part of Liberty Media or the Surviving Entity to pay money.

         (c) This Section 7.10 is intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties
and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and
representatives and shall be binding on all successors and assigns of the
Surviving Entity.

7.11 Certificates as to Indebtedness. The Company shall cause each of the
lenders who hold the three largest individual amounts of the outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company as of the Effective Time to deliver a certificate to
Parent and Liberty Media at the Closing certifying the amount of outstanding
Indebtedness of the Company to such lender as of such time.

7.12 Notification of Certain Matters. Between the date hereof and the Effective
Time, each of Liberty and the Company will give prompt notice in writing to the
other of: (i) any information that indicates that any of its representations or
warranties contained herein was not true and correct as of the date hereof or
will not be true and correct at and as of the Effective Time with the same force
and effect as if made at and as of the Effective Time (except for changes
permitted or contemplated by this Agreement), (ii) the occurrence of any event
that will result, or has a reasonable prospect of resulting, in the failure of
any condition specified in Article VIII hereof to be satisfied, (iii) any notice
or other communication from any third party alleging that the consent of such
third party is or may be required in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or that such transactions otherwise may violate
the rights of or confer remedies upon such third party and (iv) any notice of,
or other communication relating to, any litigation referred to in Section 7.13
or any order or judgment entered or rendered therein.

7.13 Defense of Litigation. Each of Liberty and the Company agrees to vigorously
defend against any and all actions, suits or proceedings in which such party is
named as a defendant that seek to enjoin, restrain or prohibit the transactions
contemplated hereby or seek damages with respect to such transactions. The
Company shall not settle any such action, suit or proceeding or fail to perfect
on a timely basis any right to appeal any judgment rendered or order entered
against the Company therein without the consent of Parent and Liberty Media
(which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld or delayed). Liberty Media and
Merger Sub shall not settle any such action, suit or proceeding, if such
settlement would have, or could reasonably be expected to have, a Material
Adverse Effect, without the consent of the Company (which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed). Each of Liberty and the Company further
agrees

                                       56
<PAGE>   61
to use its reasonable efforts to cause each of its Affiliates, directors and
officers to vigorously defend any action, suit or proceeding in which such
Affiliate, director or officer is named as a defendant and which seeks any such
relief to comply with this Section to the same extent as if such person were a
party hereto.

7.14 Additional Financial Statements. Promptly after the same become available,
the Company shall furnish to Parent and Liberty Media such additional financial
data concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent or Liberty Media may
reasonably request, including any audited consolidated financial statements of
the furnishing party for any year ending on or after the date hereof, prepared
in conformity with the requirements of the Commission applicable to annual
financial statements to be included in Form 10-K under the Exchange Act, and all
interim quarterly consolidated financial statements of the furnishing party
prepared on or after the date of this Agreement, accompanied by a statement of
the principal financial officer of the Company that, in the opinion of such
officer, such quarterly financial statements were prepared in conformity with
the requirements of the Commission applicable to financial statements to be
included in Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, applied (in each such case) on a
consistent basis (except as otherwise stated in the quarterly financial
statements) and present fairly the consolidated financial position, results of
operations and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of
the date and for the period indicated (subject in the case of quarterly
financial statements to normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments).

judgment or decree enacted, promulgated, entered, issued, enforced or deemed

Agreement, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby illegal or
imposes or is reasonably likely to impose material damages or penalties in
connection therewith, (ii) requires or is reasonably likely to require, as a
result of the consummation of the Merger, the divestiture of or any restrictions
or conditions on the conduct of (A) a portion of the business or assets of the

Adverse Effect, or (B) a material portion of the business or assets of Liberty

ownership interests illegal or subject to any materially burdensome requirement
or condition, or (iv) requires or is reasonably likely to require Liberty Media
or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or the Company or any of its material

specified in Section 8.1(c)) shall have expired, other than any of the foregoing
which, if not so obtained, in force or effect, made or expired (as the case may
be) would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect (or an effect on Liberty Media and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates that,
were the Company and its Subsidiaries subjected to the same (or a materially
similar) effect, would constitute a Material Adverse Effect); provided, however,
that any Governmental Consent by the FCC relating to the Company's FCC Licenses
described in Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not be deemed
ineffective for purposes of this subsection 8.2(f) solely because such
Governmental Consent is subject to appeal (provided that no notice of appeal
shall have been filed) or to reconsideration by the FCC on its own motion.

of the Merger imposed by any Governmental Entity shall have expired, other than
any of the foregoing which, if not obtained, in force or effect, made or expired
(as the case may be), would not, either individually or in the aggregate, be
reasonably likely to have a Liberty Media Material Adverse Effect; provided,
however, that any Governmental Consent by the FCC relating to the Company's FCC
Licenses described in Section 4.15 of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall not
be deemed ineffective for purposes of this subsection 8.4(f) solely because such
Governmental Consent is subject to appeal (provided that no notice of appeal
shall have been filed) or to reconsideration by the FCC on its own motion.

                                  ARTICLE IX.
                                   TERMINATION

         9.1 Termination and Abandonment. This Agreement may be terminated and
the transactions contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time, whether before or after approval and adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company:

             (i) by mutual consent of Parent, Liberty Media and the Company;

             (ii) by any of the Company, Parent or Liberty Media: (A) if the
Merger shall not have been consummated on or before December 31, 2000, provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (ii)(A) shall
not be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the
Merger to be consummated on or before such date, and provided further that if
the Merger has not been consummated on or before December 31, 2000 solely as a
result of the failure of the conditions set forth in Sections 8.1(b) (if the
failure to satisfy such condition is the result of any material acquisition or
other transaction, or agreement with respect thereto, engaged in, or entered
into, by Parent or Liberty Media or any of their respective Affiliates whether
prior to or after the date hereof), 8.1(c), 8.2(d), 8.2(f), 8.3(d), 8.3(f),
8.4(d), or 8.4(f) to be satisfied or waived, any party, by written notice to the
other parties, may extend such date up to February 28, 2001, (B) if there has
been a material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on
the part of any other party contained in this Agreement, in each case that is
not curable, such that the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) or (b) or
Sections 8.3(a) or (b), in the case of such a breach by the Company, or Sections
8.4(a) or (b), in the case of such a breach by Parent, Merger Sub or Liberty
Media, cannot be satisfied, (C) if any court of competent jurisdiction or other
competent Governmental Entity shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or
taken any other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise
prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other action shall have
become final and nonappealable, or (D) the stockholders of the Company fail to
approve and adopt the Merger Proposal by the requisite vote (I) at the Special
Meeting, or (II) by the date one day prior to the applicable date referred to in
(A) above, provided the Registration Statement became effective (unless the
failure of the Registration Statement to become effective is the result of the
Company's material breach of Section 3.2(a)) and remained effective such that
the Proxy Statement could be mailed to the Company stockholders and the Special
Meeting held prior to such applicable date (provided that Parent shall not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (D) without the concurrence of
Liberty Media); or

             (iii) by Liberty Media if (x) the Company Board withdraws or
modifies, in a manner adverse to Parent or Liberty Media, its approval or
recommendation of the Merger or (y) the Company Board approves or recommends, or
authorizes the Company to enter into an agreement with respect to, an
Extraordinary Transaction.

             (iv) by the Company, pursuant to Section 7.5(c).

9.2      Termination Fee; Effects of Termination.

         (a) If (i) during the term of this Agreement, the Company Board
withdraws or modifies, in a manner adverse to Parent or Liberty Media, its
approval or recommendation of the Merger, or the Company Board approves, or
recommends, or authorizes the Company to enter into an agreement with respect
to, an Extraordinary Transaction, and (ii) this Agreement is thereafter
terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(ii), Section 9.1(iii) or Section 9.1(iv), and
(iii) in the case of any termination pursuant to Section 9.1(ii) only, the
Company thereafter enters into any definitive agreement with respect to or
consummates an Extraordinary Transaction with any Person other than Liberty
Media, Parent or an Affiliate of either of them, within six months after the
date of such termination, then, in any such case, the Company shall immediately
pay Liberty Media a fee of $3.5 million (the "Termination Fee"), payable by wire
transfer of same day funds.

         (b) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company, Parent or Liberty
Media pursuant to Section 9.1, this Agreement forthwith shall become void and
there shall be no liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Liberty Media,
Merger Sub, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates, stockholders,
directors, officers, agents employees or Representatives except (i) as provided
in Sections 4.24, 6.8, 7.2 and 7.5, which shall survive such termination and
(ii) subject to Section 10.10, to the extent such termination results from the
willful breach by Parent, Liberty Media, Merger Sub or the Company of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement.

         (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, any
election by the Company to pay, or by Liberty Media or Parent to receive, the
Termination Fee pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall constitute full settlement of
any and all liabilities of the Company for damages under this Agreement in
respect of a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.1(i), 9.1(ii)
and 9.1(iii) and shall be the sole measure of damages with respect to such
termination.

         (d) In the event of any termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.1, Parent shall have no further obligation or liability hereunder,
except for its confidentiality obligations pursuant to Section 7.2.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

or to such other Person or address as any party shall specify by notice in
writing to the other party. All such notices, requests, demands, waivers and
communications shall be deemed to have been received on the date of delivery or
on the third business day after the mailing thereof, except that any notice of a
change of address shall be effective only upon actual receipt thereof.

10.3 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (including the Schedules, Exhibits and
other documents referred to herein), together with (in the case of the Company
and Liberty Media) the Mutual Nondisclosure Agreement, dated as of March 20,
2000, between the Company and Liberty Media, constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, oral
and written, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

10.4 Assignment; Binding Effect; Benefit. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, benefits or obligations hereunder may be assigned by any party (whether
by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
party. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Except for Section 7.10, nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any person other than
the parties or their respective successors and permitted assigns, any rights,
remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement.

10.5 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by action of all the parties, by
action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of Directors, at any time
before or after approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by the
stockholders of the Company, but, after any such approval by the stockholders of
the Company, no amendment shall be made which by

                                       67
<PAGE>   72
law requires further approval by such stockholders of the Company without such
further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of each of the parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(a) the provisions of Sections 7.4 (other than to the extent related to Sections
7.4(c)(i), and 7.4(i)) and 7.5 may be amended by an instrument signed in writing
by the Company and Liberty Media, without any action on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub and (b) following the Effective Time, this sentence of this Section
10.5 may only be amended by an instrument signed in writing by Parent, Liberty
Media and, on behalf of the Company, by at least one individual who was serving
on the board of directors of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time.

10.6 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties, by
action taken or authorized by each such party's Board of Directors, may, to the
extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time specified herein for the performance
of any of the obligations of the other parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties of the other parties contained herein or in
any document delivered pursuant hereto, (iii) waive compliance by the other
parties with any of the agreements or covenants of such other parties contained
herein or (iv) waive any condition to such waiving party's obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or to any of such waiving
party's other obligations hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Any such extension or waiver by any
party shall be binding on such party but not on any other party entitled to the
benefits of the provision of this Agreement affected unless such other party
also has agreed to such extension or waiver. No such waiver shall constitute a
waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other breach or
failure to strictly comply with the provisions of this Agreement. The failure of
any party to insist on strict compliance with this Agreement or to assert any of
its rights or remedies hereunder or with respect hereto shall not constitute a
waiver of such rights or remedies. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits
consent or approval by any party, such consent or approval shall be effective if
given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of
compliance as set forth in this Section 10.6. Any waiver by either Parent or
Liberty Media shall require the consent of both Parent and Liberty Media.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of Sections 7.4 (other than to the
extent related to Sections 7.4(c)(i) and 7.4(h)) and 7.5 may be waived by an
instrument signed in writing by the Company and Liberty Media without any action
on the part of Parent or Merger Sub.

10.7 Parent Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the pursuit and/or consummation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates of any Parent Transaction shall be deemed not to be a breach of
any provision of this Agreement.

10.8 Headings. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. The phrase "made available" in this Agreement
shall mean that the information referred to has been made available if requested
by the party to whom such information is to be made available.

10.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which
shall be deemed to be an original, and all of which together shall be deemed to
be one and the same instrument.

                                       68
<PAGE>   73
10.10 Applicable Law. This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties
hereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws thereof.

10.11 Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any court of the United States or
in Delaware state court, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto
(a) consents to submit itself to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of any Federal
court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court in the event
any dispute arises out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, and (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court.

10.12 Company Disclosure Schedule. The parties acknowledge that the Company
Disclosure Schedule (i) relates to certain matters concerning the disclosures
required and transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) is qualified in
its entirety by reference to specific provisions of this Agreement and (iii) is
not intended to constitute and shall not be construed as indicating that such
matter is required to be disclosed, nor shall such disclosure be construed as an
admission that such information is material with respect to the Company, or any
of its Subsidiaries or will have or is likely to have a Material Adverse Effect,
Liberty Media Material Adverse Effect, Parent Material Adverse Effect or Parent
Adverse Effect. Disclosure of the information contained in one section or part
of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed as proper disclosure for
other sections or parts of the Company Disclosure Schedule only if appropriately
cross-referenced or if the relevance thereof is reasonably apparent from the
context in which it appears and provided, further that information set forth in
the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to qualify the representations
in Section 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 of this Agreement only if such information is set
forth in Section 4.1, 4.2 or 4.3, as applicable, of the Company Disclosure
Schedule.
