(xii)each of the Liabilities set forth on Schedule 2.1(d)(xii).

   

2.2Purchase Price

 

.

 

(a)Closing Date Consideration. In consideration for the Purchased Assets,
Buyer shall (x) assume the Assumed Liabilities as provided in Section 2.1(c)
and (y) pay to Allscripts Healthcare (on behalf of the Sellers) cash in an
amount equal to the Closing Date Consideration. The "Closing Date
Consideration" shall be equal to the Base Purchase Price, as increased by the
Working Capital Overage, if any, or decreased by the Working Capital Underage,
if any minus the Agreed Adjustment Amount.

 

(b)Estimated Closing Date Statement. Not later than the third (3rd) Business
Day prior to the Closing Date, Allscripts Healthcare shall prepare and
deliver, or cause to be prepared and delivered, to Buyer an estimated closing
statement (the "Estimated Closing Date Statement") setting forth Allscripts
Healthcare's good faith calculation of the Estimated Closing Date
Consideration, and detailing the estimated Net Working Capital as of the
Effective Time (the "Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital"). The
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital set forth in the Estimated Closing
Date Statement will be prepared in accordance with Exhibit F. Buyer shall be
entitled to comment on and request reasonable changes to the Estimated Closing
Date Statement and Allscripts Healthcare shall consider in good faith any
changes Buyer proposes to the Estimated Closing Date Statement and revise such
statement if, based on its good faith assessment, such changes are warranted.
To the extent that any Seller or its respective Affiliate receives a payment,
credit or adjustment for Aged A/R prior to the Closing that can be
specifically identified to a particular invoice, such payment, credit or
adjustment will be allocated to that particular invoice; in all other cases, a
Seller will contact the applicable account debtor and apply the payment as
directed by the account debtor. No Seller will encourage an account debtor to
designate payment to any specific invoice.

 

(c)Closing Date Net Working Capital Adjustment. If the Estimated Closing Date
Net Working Capital is less than the Working Capital Lower Target, then the
Closing Date Consideration will be reduced by an amount (such amount expressed
as an absolute value) equal to the Working Capital Lower Target minus the
Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital (such amount, the "Working Capital
Underage"). If the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital is greater than
the Working Capital Upper Target, then the Closing Date Consideration will be
increased by an amount (such amount expressed as an absolute value) equal to
the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital minus the Working Capital Upper
Target (such amount, the "Working Capital Overage"). If the Estimated Closing
Date Net Working Capital is greater than or equal to the Working Capital Lower
Target, but less than or equal to the Working Capital Upper Target, then the
Closing Date Consideration will not be adjusted pursuant to this Section
2.1(c), but may be subject to adjustment for a Working Capital Underage or
Working Capital Overage following the Closing, as otherwise provided in
Section 2.3.

 

(d)Closing Payments. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay to Allscripts Healthcare
(on behalf of the Sellers) the Estimated Closing Date Consideration.

   

2.3Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustments

 

.

 

(a)Final Closing Date Statement. Within forty-five (45) days after the Closing
Date, Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Allscripts Healthcare
a statement (the "Final Closing Date Statement"), setting forth Buyer's good
faith calculation of the Closing Date Consideration, and detailing the Net
Working Capital as of the Effective Time (the "Final Closing Date Net Working
Capital"). The Final Closing Date Statement, including the calculation of the
Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, is to be prepared in accordance with
Exhibit F. The Parties agree that the purpose of preparing the Final Closing
Date Statement and determining the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital and
the related purchase price adjustment contemplated by this Section 2.3, is to
measure the amount of change between the Estimated Closing Date Net Working
Capital and the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, and such processes are
not intended to permit the introduction of different judgments, accounting
methods, policies, principles, practices, procedures, classifications or
estimation methodologies for the purpose of preparing the Final Closing Date
Statement or determining the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital. If Buyer
fails to timely deliver the Final Closing Date Statement in accordance with
the foregoing, then Allscripts Healthcare shall provide prompt written notice
of such failure and, to the extent Buyer subsequently fails to deliver the
Final Closing Date Statement within fifteen (15) days after such notice, then,
at the election of Allscripts Healthcare in its sole discretion, either (1)
the Estimated Closing Date Statement shall be deemed to be the Final Closing
Date Statement or (2) Allscripts Healthcare shall retain (at the expense of
Buyer) the dispute resolution group of the Atlanta office of Ernst and Young
Global Limited or if the Atlanta office of Ernst and Young Global Limited
refuses such submission, the dispute resolution group of a nationally-
recognized, independent accounting firm (such accounting firm, the "Accounting
Firm"), to provide an audit of the EPSi Business' books, review the
calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Consideration and make any
adjustments necessary thereto consistent with the provisions of this Section
2.3, the determination of the Accounting Firm being conclusive and binding on
the Parties. In connection with the foregoing, Buyer shall make any relevant
books and records available to the Accounting Firm in connection with its
services, and all fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by
Buyer.

 

(b)Dispute. Within forty-five (45) days following timely receipt by Allscripts
Healthcare of the Final Closing Date Statement (the "Dispute Period"),
Allscripts Healthcare shall deliver written notice (a "Dispute Notice") to
Buyer of any disagreement Allscripts Healthcare has with respect to the
preparation or content of the Final Closing Date Statement. Such Dispute
Notice must describe in reasonable detail the items contained in the Final
Closing Date Statement with which Allscripts Healthcare disagrees and, to the
extent available, the basis for any such disagreement. If Allscripts
Healthcare does not provide Buyer with a Dispute Notice related to the Final
Closing Date Statement within the Dispute Period, the Final Closing Date
Statement delivered by Buyer pursuant to Section 2.3(a) will be final,
conclusive and binding on the Parties. Any item in the Final Closing Date
Statement not included in the Dispute Notice shall be final, binding, and
conclusive for all purposes hereunder. In the event Allscripts Healthcare
provides Buyer with a Dispute Notice, Buyer and Allscripts Healthcare shall
negotiate in good faith to resolve all disagreements related thereto. If Buyer
and Allscripts Healthcare, notwithstanding such good faith effort, fail to
resolve any of the disagreements contained in the Dispute Notice within thirty
(30) days after Allscripts

   

Healthcare provides Buyer with such Dispute Notice, then Buyer and Allscripts
Healthcare jointly shall engage the Accounting Firm or such other nationally
recognized accounting firm as may be mutually acceptable to Buyer and
Allscripts Healthcare to resolve any such disagreement(s).

 

(c)Method of Dispute Resolution. Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer will enter
into a customary engagement agreement with the Accounting Firm and agree to
cooperate in good faith with the Accounting Firm during the term of its
engagement. Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer shall jointly instruct the
Accounting Firm that it: (i) shall review only the unresolved disputed items
contained in the Dispute Notice; (ii) shall make its determination based
solely upon the written submissions of Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer (i.e.,
not by independent review), and the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including the definitions set forth herein; (iii) shall render its decision
within thirty (30) days after the referral of the dispute to the Accounting
Firm for a decision pursuant hereto; and (iv) shall not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either Party. As
promptly as practicable following the Accounting Firm's engagement, Buyer and
Allscripts Healthcare shall each prepare and submit a presentation to the
Accounting Firm. Following the delivery of the presentations, Buyer and
Allscripts Healthcare may each submit a response to the other Party's
presentation. As soon as practicable thereafter, the Accounting Firm shall
make its final determination with respect to each disputed item based solely
on their respective presentations. Neither Allscripts Healthcare nor Buyer
(and none of their respective representatives) shall have any ex parte
conversation(s) or meeting(s) with the Accounting Firm without the prior
consent of (x) with respect to Allscripts Healthcare, Buyer and (y) with
respect to Buyer, Allscripts Healthcare. The fees, costs and expenses of the
Accounting Firm shall be allocated to and borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Allscripts Healthcare, on the other hand, based on the inverse of the
percentage that the Accounting Firm's determination (before such allocation)
bears to the total amount of the total items in dispute as originally
submitted to the Accounting Firm. For example, should the items in dispute
total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Firm awards $600 in favor of
Buyer's position, 60% of the costs of the Accounting Firm would be borne by
Allscripts Healthcare and 40% of the costs would be borne by Buyer. All
determinations made by the Accounting Firm shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the Parties. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of the
Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which
such determination is to be enforced.

 

(d)Access. For purposes of complying with the terms set forth in this Section
2.3, each Party shall promptly and reasonably cooperate with and make
reasonably available to the other Parties and their respective representatives
all information, records, data and working papers, including reasonable access
to its applicable accounting and finance personnel during normal business
hours, as may be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation and
analysis of the Estimated Closing Date Statement and the Final Closing Date
Statement and the resolution of any disagreement related thereto.

 

(e)Post-Closing Adjustment. Not later than the third (3rd) Business Day after
the date on which all of the items on the Final Closing Date Statement are
finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, Allscripts Healthcare and
Buyer shall jointly determine the amount by which the Estimated Closing Date
Consideration would have been adjusted pursuant to

   

Section 2.1 had the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, as finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, been substituted for the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital.

 

(i)If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
that is greater than the Estimated Closing Date Consideration (any such
excess, the "Price Increase"), then Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to
Allscripts Healthcare (on behalf of the Sellers) within three (3) Business
Days from the date on which the Final Closing Date Statement is finally
determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds, an aggregate amount in cash equal to the Price Increase.

 

(ii)If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
that is less than the Estimated Closing Date Consideration (such deficit, the
"Price Decrease"), then Allscripts Healthcare shall pay or cause to be paid to
Buyer, within three (3) Business Days from the date on which the Final Closing
Date Statement is finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.3, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an aggregate amount in cash equal to
the Price Decrease.

 

(iii)If such substitution would have resulted in a Closing Date Consideration
equal to the Estimated Closing Date Consideration, then no adjustment shall be
made to the consideration payable hereunder pursuant to this Section 2.3.

 

2.4Withholding

 

. Sellers and Buyer (as appropriate) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such
amounts as are required by applicable Tax Law to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. If any amounts are to be withheld pursuant to
the preceding sentence, Buyer shall give prompt notice to such Person and
cooperate with such Person in good faith to reduce or mitigate such
withholding. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
such Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

be material to the EPSi Business. No Seller is in default or violation under
any of the Permits, and, to the Sellers' Knowledge, no event, circumstances or
state of facts has occurred

   

which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute a default of

Person resulting from the distribution to Buyer or its representatives or
Buyer's use of any such information, including any data room (including any

provided or made available to Buyer or its representatives, in connection with
the purchase and sale of the Purchased Assets and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

. After giving effect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and assuming (a) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of
Sellers contained in this Agreement, and (b) the satisfaction of the
conditions to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing in Article VIII,
then as of immediately following the Closing, Buyer: (i) will be solvent (in

than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as they
become absolute and matured), (ii) will not have unreasonably small capital
with which to engage in its business; and (iii) will not have incurred and
will not plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute
and matured. No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being

in a breach of any provisions of any Organizational Document of the Guarantor,

pursuant to any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, license, agreement, lease or
other instrument or obligation to which it is a party or by which it or any of

available funds to satisfy the Obligations.

prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) of (a) with respect to such releases or statements

statements by Sellers, Buyer, except as such release or statement may be
required by applicable Law, including the rules or regulations of the U.S.

Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that Buyer, Guarantor, Parent and
Sellers may disclose the terms and existence of this Agreement (i) to comply
with any SEC disclosure obligations or (ii) in any public announcement or

and to assist and cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and to obtain satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including (a)
obtaining all of the Consents and the making of all filings and the taking of
all steps as may be necessary to obtain a Consent from, or to avoid an Action
by, any Governmental Authority, (b) obtaining the necessary Consents from
third parties, and (c) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The "commercially reasonable efforts" of Sellers and Buyer shall
not require Sellers, Buyer, or any of their Affiliates, to pay any material
amounts to third parties to obtain such Consent or to remedy any breach of any
representation or warranty hereunder, to commence any litigation or
arbitration proceeding, to offer or grant or otherwise provide any
accommodation (financial or otherwise) to any Person or, with respect to
Sellers, to provide financing to Buyer for the completion of the transactions
contemplated hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Section 7.6 shall control with respect to the matters set forth therein
(including all HSR Act and other Antitrust Law matters), and to the extent
there is any conflict between this Section 7.4 and Section 7.6, Section 7.6
shall control in all respects.

 

7.5Restrictive Covenants

 

.

 

(a)From the Closing until the four-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"), Sellers will not, and Sellers shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to, solicit, recruit, encourage or induce or attempt
to solicit, recruit, encourage or induce any of the Persons set forth on
Schedule 7.5(a) (collectively, the "Senior Individuals") to leave the service
of Buyer. During the Restricted Period, Sellers will not, and Sellers shall
cause their respective Affiliates not to, hire, employ, engage or attempt to
hire, employ or engage any of the Senior Individuals (whether as an employee,
consultant, agent, independent contractor, representative or otherwise).

   

(b)During the Restricted Period, Sellers will not, and Sellers shall cause
their respective Affiliates not to, undertake, participate in or carry on or
be engaged in, or in any other manner advise or knowingly assist any other
Person in connection with the operation of, any Competing Business anywhere in
Asia, Australia, Europe, North America or South America. "Competing Business"
means any business that provides software offerings competitive to the
software offerings set forth on Schedule 7.5(b)(i); provided, however, in no
event shall "Competing Business" include any other activities or other
business that Sellers or any of their respective Affiliates participates in or
engages in as of the date hereof.

 

(c)Except as contemplated by this Agreement or any Seller Document, Sellers
will not use any Business Confidential Information or Trade Secrets or
disclose any Business Confidential Information or Trade Secrets to any Person,
without the prior written consent of Buyer. With respect to the Business
Confidential Information, the obligations of Sellers will continue until the
end of the Restricted Period. With respect to Trade Secrets, the obligations
of Sellers will continue for as long as the applicable information continues
to constitute a Trade Secret as defined in this Agreement. Nothing in this
Agreement will diminish the rights of Buyer or its Affiliates regarding the
protection of Trade Secrets and other intellectual property pursuant to Law.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.5, Sellers and their respective
Affiliates shall not be prohibited from or restricted in any way with respect
to: (i) advertising job openings by use of third party recruiters, newspapers,
magazines, the Internet, social media or any other media, so long as such
efforts are not specifically directed at any Senior Individual, or result in
the hiring of any such Senior Individual; (ii) hiring or soliciting any Senior
Individual who has been terminated by, or has terminated employment with,
Buyer or any Affiliate thereof for more than six (6) months, so long as there
was no solicitation by such Seller or its Affiliates prior thereto; (iii)
continuing to engage in any business that any Seller or any of their
respective Affiliates engages in as of the date of this Agreement (other than
the EPSi Business); (iv) integrating any products, services or solutions of
any Competing Business with or into any products, services or solutions of
Sellers or their respective Affiliates and any remote hosting thereof, so long
as the primary purpose of such integration is not to engage in the Competing
Business; (v) referring without remuneration any clients of Sellers or their
respective Affiliates to any Competing Business; (vi) holding, as a passive
investment, not more than ten percent (10%) of the outstanding voting
securities of any company (whether public or private) that is primarily
engaged in a Competing Business; (vii) acquiring, and following such
acquisition, actively engaging in any business that has a subsidiary,
division, group, franchise or segment that is engaged in any Competing
Business, so long as for the most recent fiscal year ending prior to the date
of such acquisition, the revenues derived from the Competing Business were
less than the lesser of ten percent (10%) of the total consolidated revenues
of the acquired business and $10,000,000; or (viii) fulfilling their
respective obligations under this Agreement or any other Seller Document.

 

(e)Sellers acknowledge that their obligations under this Section 7.5 are
reasonable in the context of the nature of the EPSi Business and the
competitive injuries likely to be sustained by Buyer if any Seller or any of
its Affiliates were to violate such obligations. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision of this
Section 7.5 is invalid or unenforceable, the Parties agree that it is their
intention that the

   

court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability will reduce
the scope, duration or area of the term or provision, delete specific words or
phrases or replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term
or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to
expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision.

 

7.6Antitrust and Other Closing Matters

 

.

 

(a)Each of Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer agrees to file all appropriate
notifications and filings pursuant to the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in the most expeditious manner practicable, but in any event within five (5)
Business Days after the date hereof and to respond promptly to any request for
additional information and documentary material that may be issued to such
Party by the relevant Governmental Authorities in connection with the HSR Act
or any other applicable Antitrust Law. Each of Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer
agrees to use its good faith commercially reasonable efforts to obtain early
termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable
Antitrust Law. No Party shall take any action or step to extend, delay, or
prevent the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under
the HSR Act or other Antitrust Law without the express advance written consent
of the other Parties. Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary,
Buyer and each Seller agree to use reasonable best efforts to take, and to
cause its Affiliates to take, any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate as soon as possible each and every impediment under the HSR Act or
any other applicable Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority or third party including (X) using commercially reasonable efforts
to respond to any request for additional information or documentary material
from any United States or foreign antitrust Governmental Authority and (Y)
using commercially reasonable efforts to respond to any second request from
any United States or foreign antitrust Governmental Authority; provided,
however, Buyer, Guarantor, Parent and Sellers shall not be required to, and in
the case of the Purchased Assets, no Seller shall without prior consent of
Buyer, commit to and/or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order or
otherwise, the sale or disposition of any assets, securities, facilities or
other properties, the licensing of any intellectual property, or any other
structural or conduct relief, in order to facilitate the expiration or
termination of the HSR Act waiting period or otherwise obtain all applicable
merger control clearances under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust
Law requirements; and provided, further, neither Buyer nor Guarantor shall
have any obligation to litigate or contest any Action or Order seeking to
enjoin, restraint, or prohibit the consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer shall pay the filing fees associated
with all filings under the HSR Act and any other applicable Antitrust Law.
Allscripts and Buyer shall consult and cooperate with one another, and
consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any Party in connection
with proceedings under or relating to the Antitrust Laws. Each of the Parties
agrees not to participate in any substantive meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any antitrust Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement unless it
consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited
by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the reasonable
opportunity to attend and participate. Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer will
supply each other with (i) in advance of submission and with a reasonable
opportunity for review and comment thereon, a draft of any contemplated
substantive communication with an antitrust Governmental

   

Authority relating to the transactions contemplated hereby, and (ii) copies of
all substantive correspondence, filings or communications with antitrust
Governmental Authorities with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that to extent any of the documents or
information are commercially or competitively sensitive, Allscripts Healthcare
or Buyer, as the case may be, may satisfy its obligations by providing such
documents or information to the other Party's outside antitrust counsel, with
the understanding and agreement that such antitrust counsel shall not share
such documents and information with its client.

 

(b)No Party will enter into any transaction, or any contractual arrangement or
other agreement, whether oral or written, to effect any transaction (including
any merger or acquisition) that could reasonably be expected to make it
materially more difficult, or to materially increase the time required, to:
(i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law, (ii) avoid the entry of, or effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
or decree that would materially delay or prevent the consummation of the

authorizations, consents, orders and approvals of Governmental Authorities
necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

7.7Retained Names and Marks

 

.

 

(a)Buyer agrees and acknowledges that, except as set forth in this Section
7.7, nothing herein grants Buyer or its Affiliates any rights in any
registered or unregistered Trademarks incorporating the word "Allscripts" or
any of the words, marks, corporate symbols, acronyms or logos of Sellers and
their respective Affiliates (except as included in the Purchased Assets) or
any derivation thereof (collectively, the "Seller Marks"). Except as set forth
in Section 7.7(b), Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, use
the Seller Marks in connection with the EPSi Business or for any other purpose
following the Closing.

 

(b)Effective as of the Closing and until the three (3) month anniversary of
the Closing Date (the "Marks Transition Period"), Sellers and their respective
Affiliates hereby grant to Buyer and its Affiliates a worldwide, non-
exclusive, royalty-free license to use the Seller Marks in connection with the
operation of the EPSi Business, including on websites and materials such as
signs, purchase orders, invoices, sales orders, labels, letterheads, shipping
documents, business cards and product packaging. Promptly following the
Closing (and in any event prior to the expiration of the Marks Transition
Period), Buyer shall effect the elimination of any use of the Seller Marks in
the EPSi Business, including by removing the Seller Marks from the EPSi
Business' respective signage, stationary, purchase orders, invoices, labels,
packaging, business cards, equipment, machinery and advertising materials;
provided, however, that with respect to paper goods and other similar
inventory items, Buyer shall be permitted to use any such amounts of materials
existing at the Closing until they are depleted.

   

7.8Non-Assignable Assets

 

.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, but subject to
the provisions of this Section 7.8(a) and Section 7.13, to the extent that the
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, to Buyer of any Purchased Asset
would result in a violation of applicable Law, or would require the Consent of
a Person who is not a Party or an Affiliate of a Party (including any
Governmental Authority), and such Consent shall not have been obtained prior
to the Closing Date, this Agreement shall not constitute a sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery, or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer,
conveyance or delivery. Following the Closing Date, Sellers and Buyer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts, and shall cooperate with each other, to
obtain any such required Consent or any release, substitution or amendment
required to novate all Liabilities under any and all Purchased Assets or other
Liabilities that constitute Assumed Liabilities or to obtain in writing the
unconditional release of all parties to such arrangements, so that, in any
case, Buyer shall be solely responsible for such Liabilities from and after
the Closing Date; provided, however, that this Section 7.8(a) shall not be
deemed to require Sellers or Buyer to pay any material consideration therefor
or institute any Action. Once such Consent or any release, substitution or
amendment is obtained, the applicable Seller shall assign, transfer, convey
and deliver to Buyer the relevant Purchased Asset to which such Consent or any
release, substitution or amendment relates for no additional consideration.

 

(b)To the extent that any Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability cannot be
transferred to or assumed by Buyer following the Closing Date pursuant to
Section 2.1, Sellers and Buyer shall enter into such arrangements (such as
subleasing, sublicensing or subcontracting, or through the TSA) to provide to
the Parties the economic and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law,
operational equivalent of the transfer of such Purchased Asset or Assumed
Liability to Buyer as of the Closing Date or as reasonably requested by Buyer
under which (i) Buyer would receive the rights and benefits of ownership of
such Purchased Assets, including the net profits from the operation or
subsequent sale of such Purchased Assets, and including the right to manage
and control such Purchased Assets and (ii) Sellers and their Affiliates would
enforce for the benefit of Buyer against a third party associated with such
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities, claim, right or benefit. Buyer
shall, as agent or subcontractor for Sellers, pay, perform and discharge fully
the Liabilities of Sellers thereunder from and after the Closing Date,
including completing the work or providing the goods and services contemplated
thereunder, and bearing all Taxes with respect thereto or arising therefrom.
Buyer shall promptly reimburse the reasonable costs and expenses of Sellers
and their Affiliates related to compliance with this Section 7.8(b). To the
extent permitted under applicable Law, Sellers shall, at Buyer's sole expense,
hold in trust for and pay to Buyer promptly (but in any event no later than
ten (10) Business Days) upon receipt thereof, such Purchased Asset and all
income, proceeds and other monies received by Sellers to the extent related to
such Purchased Asset in connection with the arrangements under this Section
7.8(b), including all cash received from customers of the EPSi Business.

 

7.9Wrong Pockets

(a)From and after the Closing, if any Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates receives or collects any funds relating to any Purchased Asset,
such Seller or such

   

Affiliate shall remit such funds to Buyer within twenty (20) Business Days
after its receipt thereof.

 

(b)From and after the Closing, if Buyer or any of its Affiliates receives or
collects any funds that are not a Purchased Asset and are otherwise due to
Sellers or any of their Affiliates, Buyer or such Affiliate shall remit such
funds to Allscripts Healthcare within twenty (20) Business Days after its
receipt thereof.

 

(c)If, at any time after the Closing, any asset held by Buyer or its
Affiliates is ultimately determined to be an Excluded Asset or Buyer or any of
its Affiliates is found to be subject to a Excluded Liability, then, at
Sellers' expense, (i) Buyer shall return or transfer and convey (without
further consideration) to the appropriate Seller or the appropriate Affiliate
of Sellers such Excluded Asset or Excluded Liability; (ii) the appropriate
Seller or its appropriate Affiliate shall assume (without further
consideration) such Excluded Liability; and (iii) Sellers and Buyer shall, and
shall cause their appropriate Affiliates to, execute such documents or
instruments of conveyance or assumption and take such further acts as are
reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the transfer of such Excluded
Asset or Excluded Liability back to the appropriate Seller or its appropriate
Affiliate, in each case such that each Party is put into the same economic
position as if such action had been taken on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d)If, at any time after the Closing, any asset held by a Seller or its
Affiliates is ultimately determined to be a Purchased Asset or a Seller or any
of its Affiliates is found to be subject to an Assumed Liability, then, at
Buyer's expense, (i) such Seller shall return or transfer and convey (without
further consideration) to Buyer or the appropriate Affiliate such Purchased
Asset or Assumed Liability; (ii) Buyer or its appropriate Affiliate shall
assume (without further consideration) such Assumed Liability; and (iii)
Sellers and Buyer shall, and shall cause their appropriate Affiliates to,
execute such documents or instruments of conveyance or assumption and take
such further acts as are reasonably necessary or desirable to effect the
transfer of such Purchased Asset or Assumed Liability back to Buyer or its
appropriate Affiliate, in each case such that each Party is put into the same
economic position as if such action had been taken on or prior to the Closing
Date.

 

7.10Post-Closing Access

 

.

 

(a)From and after the Closing Date, Buyer shall afford promptly to Allscripts
Healthcare and its designees and representatives, reasonable access to the
Business Records and the Transferring Employees to the extent necessary for
legitimate and reasonable business purposes of Allscripts Healthcare and its
Affiliates relating to any Seller Document or related to any period ending on
or before the Closing Date (at Allscripts Healthcare's sole cost and expense);
provided that any such access by Allscripts Healthcare shall be during normal
business hours on reasonable notice and shall not otherwise unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the EPSi Business by Buyer. Unless otherwise
consented to in writing by Allscripts Healthcare, Buyer shall not, for a
period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, destroy, alter or otherwise
dispose of any of the Business Records without first offering to surrender to
Allscripts Healthcare such Business Records or any portion thereof which Buyer
may intend to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of. Sellers will hold in
confidence all Confidential Information obtained from Buyer or any of its
Affiliates in accordance with Section 7.5(c).

   

(b)From and after the Closing Date, Sellers shall afford promptly to Buyer and
its designees and representatives reasonable access to the books and records
(including accountants' work papers) of Sellers to the extent necessary for
legitimate and reasonable business purposes of Buyer and its Affiliates to the
extent related to the EPSi Business prior to the Closing Date (at Buyer's sole
cost and expense) (the "Retained Records"); provided that any such access by
Buyer shall be during normal business hours on reasonable notice and shall not
otherwise unreasonably interfere with the conduct of the businesses of
Sellers. Unless otherwise consented to in writing by Buyer, Sellers shall not,
for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing Date, destroy, alter or
otherwise dispose of any of the Retained Records without first offering to
surrender to Buyer such Retained Records or any portion thereof which such
Seller may intend to destroy, alter or otherwise dispose of. Buyer will not
use any Confidential Information obtained from Sellers or any of their
Affiliates pursuant to this Section 7.10(b) or disclose any of such
Confidential Information to any Person, without the prior written consent of
Sellers. The obligations of Buyer with respect to such Confidential
Information will survive for two (2) years from the date of disclosure of such
Confidential Information to Buyer pursuant to this Section 7.10(b).

 

(c)Each Party may restrict the foregoing access to the extent that (i)
applicable Law requires such Party or any of its Affiliates to restrict or
prohibit such access or the provision of such information, (ii) providing such
access or information would breach a confidentiality or other obligation to a
third party, or (iii) providing such access or disclosure of any such
information would reasonably be expected to result in the loss or waiver of
the attorney-client or other applicable privilege or protection.

 

7.11Employee Matters

 

.

 

(a)Offers of Employment. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the Closing
Date, Buyer shall or shall cause an Affiliate of Buyer to make an offer of
employment to each Business Employee listed on Schedule 7.11(a). Such offers
of employment shall be effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing. Each
such offer of employment shall be consistent with the requirements of this
Section 7.11. Business Employees who accept such offer of employment from
Buyer or any of its Affiliates shall collectively be referred to as the
"Transferring Employees." Upon acceptance, such offers of employment for each
Transferring Employee will supersede any prior agreements regarding the terms
and conditions of employment as in effect prior to the Closing.

 

(b)Transferring Employee Compensation. Buyer agrees that, for a period of one
year following the Closing (or, if earlier, until the date of termination of
the relevant employee), each Transferring Employee shall be eligible to
receive (i) base compensation (other than incentive compensation, equity or
equity-based compensation) that is the same or greater than the base
compensation (other than incentive compensation, equity or equity-based
compensation) provided to the Transferring Employee immediately prior to the
date hereof and (ii) employee benefits that are substantially similar in the
aggregate to the employee benefits provided to similarly situated employees of
Buyer. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any
employee benefit plans or programs it makes available to the Transferring
Employees from and after the Closing Date credit employment with any Seller
(or an Affiliate thereof) prior to the Closing Date as employment with Buyer
for purposes of

   

eligibility and vesting (including the satisfaction of any waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plans maintained by Buyer (the "Buyer Welfare
Plans")) and, for purposes of any paid vacation plan or policy (other than
credit for accrued paid time off) it adopts with respect to or makes available
to the Transferring Employees, for purposes of accrual of paid vacation after
the Closing Date, in each case to the same extent that such employment with
any Seller (or an Affiliate thereof) prior to the Closing Date was recognized
for such purpose under the corresponding Employee Plan. Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that in the plan year in which the
Closing occurs, no pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions or waiting
periods applicable with respect to medical benefits under the Buyer Welfare
Plans will apply to Transferring Employees to the extent that such
limitations, exclusions or waiting periods did not apply to or had been
satisfied by such Transferring Employee under the corresponding Employee Plan
providing medical benefits as of the Closing Date. The Buyer Welfare Plans
that are medical benefit plans in which a Transferring Employee participates
after the Closing Date will use commercially reasonable efforts to recognize,
for purposes of satisfying any deductible, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums
during the plan year in which the Closing Date occurs, any payment made by
such Transferring Employee in such plan year prior to the Closing Date toward
deductibles, co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums in any corresponding Employee
Plan. Each Seller shall and shall cause its Affiliates to pay out all accrued
but unused vacation with respect to the Transferring Employees as of the
Closing Date. Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
Buyer's plan that includes a cash or deferred arrangement pursuant to Section
401(k) of the Code shall accept "direct rollovers" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of distributions from the corresponding
Employee Plans, including the amount of any unpaid balance of any participant
loan made under such Employee Plan, if such rollovers are elected by any
Transferring Employee.

 

(c)No Guaranteed Employment. Nothing in this Section 7.11, whether express or
implied, shall: (i) confer upon any Transferring Employee or other Person any
rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued employment
for any period or any terms or conditions of employment, or any third-party
beneficiary rights hereunder; (ii) be interpreted to prevent or restrict Buyer
or its Affiliates from modifying or terminating the employment or terms of
employment of any Transferring Employee, including the amendment or
termination of any benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, Contract,
agreement or arrangement, after the Closing; or (iii) be treated as an
establishment or an amendment or other modification of any Employee Plan or
other compensation or benefit plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or
arrangement.

 

7.12Intercompany Accounts

 

. Each Seller shall take (or cause one or more of its Affiliates to take) such
action as is necessary, advisable or desirable to settle, effective as of, or
prior to, the Closing Date, all intercompany accounts with respect to the EPSi
Business. Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, all Related Party
Agreements shall be terminated as of or prior to the Closing Date without any
further Liability or obligation thereunder and without Liability to Buyer and
shall be of no further force and effect after the Closing.

 

7.13Shared Contracts

 

.

 

(a)Within ten (10) days after the execution of this Agreement, Allscripts
Healthcare shall provide Buyer with a list indicating which of the Business
Shared Contracts

   

may be split and assigned in part to Buyer or replicated for the benefit of
Buyer pursuant to its terms, without the consent of the counterparty thereto
or other conditions, including the payment of a transfer or other fee (the
"Assignable Shared Contracts"). Each Assignable Shared Contract shall
thereafter be deemed (to the extent of the split or replication with respect
to the portion of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract that relates to the EPSi
Business) to be an Assigned Contract hereunder and Sellers shall split and
partially assign (or cause to be split and partially assigned) to Buyer, or
have or cause to be replicated, for the benefit of Buyer as of the Closing
Date such Contract in accordance with its terms.

 

(b)With respect to each Business Shared Contract that is not an Assignable
Shared Contract (the "Non-Assignable Shared Contracts"), each Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the counterparty to each such Non-
Assignable Shared Contract to consent to the split and partial assignment or
replication of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract to Buyer (with respect to
the portion of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract that relates to the EPSi
Business), or to otherwise enter into a new Contract with Buyer on
substantially the same terms as exist under the applicable Business Shared
Contract as of the Closing Date. Each such Non-Assignable Shared Contract for
which the Parties have received consent to the split and partial assignment or
replication shall thereafter be deemed (to the extent of the split or
replication with respect to the portion of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract
that relates to the EPSi Business) to be an Assigned Contract hereunder and
the applicable Seller shall split and partially assign (or cause to be split
and partially assigned) to Buyer, or have or cause to be replicated, as of the
Closing Date such Contract in accordance with its terms. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Sellers and their Affiliates shall not be required to split and
partially assign to Buyer or have replicated any of the Non-Assignable Shared
Contracts for which consent has not been obtained. To the extent any
counterparty under a Non-Assignable Shared Contract requires the payment of a
transfer or other fee for the split and partial assignment or replication of
such Shared Contract, Allscripts Healthcare and Buyer shall each pay one half
of any such fee that is reasonably required. With respect to any Non-
Assignable Shared Contract, until the earlier of (i) the date that such Non-
Assignable Shared Contract becomes an Assigned Contract pursuant to this
Section 7.8(b) and (ii) the then-remaining term of such Non-Assignable Shared
Contract, (A) Sellers and their Affiliates shall pay to Buyer, on a monthly
basis, the amount set forth on Schedule 4.7(d)(ii) with respect to such Non-
Assignable Shared Contract with respect to the EPSi Business and (B) Buyer
agrees to, or to cause its Affiliates to, perform under such Non-Assignable
Shared Contract to the extent related to the EPSi Business and to the extent
required to be performed after the Closing, in each case in accordance with
its terms. For clarity, the obligation set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence shall not be subject to any deductible or cap, notwithstanding the
provisions of Article X.

 

(c)As to any Non-Assignable Shared Contract for which the Parties have not
received consent, the Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to take such
actions as are reasonably necessary to avoid any breach or violation by a
Party as a result of any failure to obtain any required consent. Until any
such consent or new Contract is obtained, such Non-Assignable Shared Contract
shall be subject to Section 7.8(b). If and when such consents or approvals are
obtained or such other required actions have been taken, the split and partial
assignment, or replication, of such Non-Assignable Shared Contract will be
effected in accordance with Section 7.13(b).

   

7.14Transfer of Business Intellectual Property

 

. Prior to the Closing, each Seller shall take (or cause a one of its
Subsidiaries to take) all actions necessary to properly record the registered
and applied for Business Intellectual Property with the applicable
intellectual property office to correct any and all chain-of-title errors and
to formally identify the registered and applied for Business Intellectual
Property in the name of the correct legal entity owner for such registered or
applied for Business Intellectual Property; to the extent such action is not
completed prior to the Closing, each Seller's obligations pursuant to this
Section 7.14 shall nevertheless continue until fully satisfied. Buyer shall be
responsible for preparing and filing all instruments and documents necessary
to effect the assignment of the Business Intellectual Property to Buyer and
its Affiliates.

 

7.15Insurance

 

. With respect to any claim, occurrence or loss that occurred or existed prior
to the Closing Date and may be covered under Insurance Policies, and Buyer
requests, pursuant to written notice, that a Seller or its applicable
Affiliate submit a claim under such Insurance Policy, such Seller shall, or
shall cause its applicable Affiliate to, at Buyer's expense, submit such claim
as so instructed, use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any such
claim or collect any claim amounts requested thereunder, and cause any
proceeds payable under Insurance Policies to cover a Loss that exceeds the
applicable insurance deductible to be collected and paid to Buyer or, if
applicable, any third-party claimant.

 

7.16Interim Financials

 

. As promptly as practicable following each calendar month prior to the
Closing Date, Sellers shall make available to Buyer periodic financial reports
in the form that it customarily prepares for its internal purposes concerning
the EPSi Business and, if available, unaudited statements of the EPSi Business
as of the last day of each calendar month and statements of income of such
entity for the period then ended. Sellers covenant that such interim
statements (a) will present fairly the financial condition of the EPSi
Business and the related results of its operations for the respective periods
then ended and (b) will be prepared on a basis consistent with prior interim
periods.

 

7.17No Solicitation of Transactions

 

. Sellers shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to,
directly or indirectly, through any Representative of any of them or
otherwise, initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-
public information or assistance), or enter into negotiations or discussions
of any type, directly or indirectly, or enter into a confidentiality Contract,
letter of intent or purchase Contract, merger Contract or other similar
Contract with any Person other than Buyer with respect to a sale of all or any
substantial portion of the EPSi Business, the liquidation or similar
extraordinary transaction with respect to the EPSi Business. Each Seller shall
notify Buyer orally (within one (1) Business Day) and in writing (as promptly
as practicable) of any inquiry or proposal by a third party to do any of the
foregoing that any Seller or any of its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives may receive relating to any of such matters.

 

7.18Notice of Certain Events

 

. Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of: (a) any notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (b) any notice or other communication from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;
(c) any Actions commenced or, to the Knowledge of Sellers or to the knowledge
of Buyer, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
the EPSi Business; (d) any circumstance that could reasonably be expected to
cause the

   

conditions set forth in Section 8.1, Section 8.2 or Section 8.3 not to be
satisfied; or (e) any failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy any
covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under
this Agreement; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to
this Section 7.18 will not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available
under this Agreement to Buyer.

(b)by Buyer or Allscripts Healthcare, upon written notice to the other Party,

10.2Indemnification

 

.

 

(a)Subject to the provisions of this Article X, from and after the Closing and

rights, claims, proceedings and causes of action it may have against any other
party (including any Affiliate of the Seller Indemnifying Parties or Buyer)
resulting from or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement or any
Seller Document and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, whether
arising under or based upon any Law (including Environmental Law) or otherwise
(including any right, whether arising at law or in equity (including strict
liability and tort), to seek indemnification, contribution, rescission, cost
recovery, damages (including Losses), or any other recourse or remedy,
including as may arise under common law) (each, a "Transaction Matter"), shall

behalf and on behalf of the Buyer Indemnitees, and in the case of Sellers, on
their own behalf and on behalf of the Seller Indemnitees) hereby (a) covenants
and agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, assert or otherwise

pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in this Article X or an
action seeking specific performance or similar equitable relief pursuant to
Section 12.14, and (y) waives, from and after the Closing, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law, any and all Transaction Matters other
than a contract action to recover Losses pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article X or an action seeking specific
performance or similar equitable relief pursuant to Section 12.14.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for purposes of this Article
X (and solely for purposes of this Article X) "Buyer Documents" and "Seller
Documents" shall not include the Restrictive Covenant Agreements and the TSA,
and the indemnification obligations of the Parties with respect to the
Restrictive Covenant Agreements and the TSA shall be set forth therein.

 

10.4Limitations on Liability

 

. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the indemnification rights
and obligations provided for in Section 10.2 are subject to the following
limitations:

 

(a)Certain Limitations. In no event shall the Seller Indemnifying Parties'
maximum aggregate liability with respect to Losses arising from Section
10.2(b)(i) with respect to breaches of the Fundamental Reps, Section 4.6,
Section 4.7(b), Section 4.7(d) and Section 10.2(b)(iii) exceed one hundred
percent (100.00%) of the Closing Date Consideration.

 

(b)Other Recovery. If any Losses sustained by an Indemnitee are covered by an
insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation of
another Person (other than an Affiliate of such Indemnitee), the Indemnitee
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to collect such insurance proceeds
or indemnity, contribution or similar payments. The amount of any Losses
subject to indemnification under Section 10.2 shall be reduced by the amounts
actually recovered by any Indemnitee, as applicable, under applicable
insurance policies or an indemnification, contribution or similar obligation
of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such Indemnitee) with respect to
claims related to such Losses (net of any unrecovered amounts, costs or
expenses incurred in connection with the recovery or receipt of such insurance
proceeds, including any increases in insurance premiums or retroactive
premiums resulting therefrom), and if any Indemnitee receives such insurance
proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar payments after the settlement
of any indemnification claim

   

under Section 10.2, as applicable, such Indemnitee shall refund to the
Indemnitor that made such indemnification payment the amount of such insurance
proceeds (net of any unrecovered amounts, costs or expenses incurred in
connection with the recovery or receipt of such insurance proceeds, including
any increases in insurance premiums or retroactive premiums resulting
therefrom) or indemnity, contribution or similar payments, up to the amount
received in connection with such indemnification claim. It is the intention of
the Parties that no insurer or third party shall be entitled to any benefit or
right it would not be entitled to receive in the absence of this paragraph.

 

(c)Damage Exclusions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law, no Party shall be
liable to any other Person for, either in contract or in tort, and Losses
shall not include, any speculative or punitive damages (other than any such
damages payable to a third Person).

 

(d)Double Recovery. No Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover damages
or obtain payment, reimbursement, restitution or indemnity more than once in
respect of any one Loss or related group of Losses, including to the extent
that any Buyer Indemnitee has been compensated therefor pursuant to Section
2.3 or otherwise.

 

(e)Mitigation. Each Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable efforts
(determined without regard to any indemnification rights of such Person
hereunder (i.e., as if such Person had no such rights hereunder)) to mitigate
any Loss for which such Indemnitee seeks indemnification, in each case solely
to the extent required by Law. Each Indemnitee shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue any and all
rights or benefits (including rights to be indemnified and held harmless or
rights to be reimbursed for, or to share, certain costs, or expenses) with
respect to any matter that is indemnifiable pursuant to Section 10.2, in each
case solely to the extent required by Law.

 

10.5Notice and Determination of Claims

 

. If any Indemnitee believes that it has sustained or incurred any Losses that
are indemnifiable under this Article X (a "Claim"), such Indemnitee shall so
notify the Indemnitor promptly in writing specifying the basis hereunder upon
which the Indemnitee's claim for indemnification is asserted and the facts and
circumstances concerning such Claim, describing such Losses, the amount
thereof, or a good faith estimate of the amount, and the method of computation
of such Losses, all with reasonable particularity, in each case to the extent
known (the "Claim Notice"). After the giving of any Claim Notice pursuant
hereto, the amount of indemnification to which an Indemnitee shall be entitled
under this Article X shall be determined: (a) by the written agreement between
the Parties; (b) by a final judgment or decree of any court of competent
jurisdiction; or (c) by any other means to which the Parties shall agree in
writing. The judgment or decree of a court shall be deemed final when the time
for appeal, if any, shall have expired and no appeal shall have been taken or
when all appeals taken shall have been finally determined. The Indemnitee
shall have the burden of proof in establishing the amount of Losses suffered
by such Indemnitee. A failure by an Indemnitee to give timely, complete or
accurate notice as provided in this Section 10.5 or in Section 10.6 will not
affect the rights or obligations of any Party except and only to the extent
that the Party entitled to receive such notice was materially damaged or
prejudiced as a result of such failure to give timely notice vis-a-vis its
rights and obligations hereunder or otherwise.

   

10.6Third Party Claims

 

.

 

(a)Promptly following the receipt of notice of a Claim by a third party
against a Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee (a "Third Party Claim"), the
Party receiving the notice of the Third Party Claim shall provide the other
Parties with a Claim Notice with respect to such Third Party Claim. Subject to
receiving a confidentiality undertaking from the Indemnitor and any redactions
that the Indemnitee determines are advisable for purposes of maintaining
privilege, such Claim Notice shall be accompanied by copies of all documents
and information relevant to the Third Party Claim and in the Indemnitee's
possession.

 

(b)Subject to Section 10.6(c) and Section 10.6(d), the Indemnitor shall have
the option to conduct and control, through counsel of its choosing, the
defense, compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim as to which
indemnification is sought by any Indemnitee from any Indemnitor hereunder. The
Indemnitor shall notify the Indemnitee in writing, as promptly as possible
(but in any case before the earlier of (i) the due date for the answer or
response to the Third Party Claim and (ii) thirty (30) days after receipt of
the notice of Third Party Claim given by the Indemnitee to the Indemnitor
under Section 10.6(a) of its election to assume the defense of such Third
Party Claim). The Indemnitee may participate, through counsel chosen by it and
at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third Party Claim as to which
the Indemnitor has so elected to conduct and control the defense thereof.
Should an Indemnitor assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance
with this Section 10.6, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Indemnitee
for any legal expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the
investigation or defense thereof; provided that in the event such Third Party
Claim is decided adversely to the Indemnitee resulting in Losses for which the
Indemnitor is required to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to this Article X,
the Indemnitor shall pay any such legal expenses incurred by the Indemnitee
prior to the date the Indemnitor assumes control of the defense of the Third
Party Claim. Should the Indemnitor not elect to conduct and control the
defense of any Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor may participate, through
counsel chosen by it and at its own expense, in the defense of any such Third
Party Claim.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.6(b) to the contrary, in no event
shall the Indemnitor be entitled to conduct and control the defense,
compromise and settlement of any Third Party Claim if (i) such Third Party
Claim seeks, as its primary claim, an injunction, other equitable relief or
any other non-monetary relief against the Indemnitee, (ii) in the event such
claim were to be decided adversely to the Indemnitee, the aggregate amount of
Losses associated therewith, together with all other outstanding Claims would
reasonably be expected to exceed the aggregate liability limitations set forth
in Section 10.2(b)(z) or Section 10.4(a), in each case, by two hundred percent
(200%), or (iii) such claim primarily relates to or arises out of any
allegedly criminal activity, (iv) the Indemnitor fails to acknowledges in
writing to the Indemnitee that any and all Losses that may be assessed against
the Indemnitee in connection with such Third Party Claim constitute Losses for
which the Indemnitee shall, subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article X, be indemnified fully pursuant to this Article X, or (v) if the
Indemnitee is a Buyer Indemnitee and the Third Party Claim is made by a
customer or supplier of the EPSi Business.

   

(d)Any Party controlling the defense of any Third Party Claim shall conduct
the defense of such Third Party Claim with reasonable diligence and shall keep
the other Parties reasonably informed of the status thereof. Whether or not
the Indemnitor or Indemnitee shall control the defense of a Third Party Claim,
neither the Indemnitor nor the Indemnitee shall consent to the entry of any
judgment, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Indemnitee or Indemnitor, as applicable (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The
Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate in connection with any Third Party Claim
pursuant to this Section 10.6 and shall furnish such records, information and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials
and appeals as may be reasonably requested by the Indemnitor in connection
therewith; provided that, notwithstanding anything in this Section 10.6 to the
contrary, the Indemnitee shall not be required to take any action hereunder
that would adversely affect, or require or constitute a waiver of, any
attorney-client or other privilege.

 

Article XI 
TAX MATTERS

 

11.1Allocation of Liability for Taxes

 

. In the case of any Taxes that are attributable to a Straddle Period, the
Parties shall use the following conventions for determining the portion of
such Tax that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion that relates
to a Post-Closing Tax Period: (a) in the case of real property or personal
property Taxes and other similar Taxes attributable to the Purchased Assets
imposed on a periodic basis, the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-
Closing Tax Period shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire
period by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in
the portion of the period commencing before the Closing Date and ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in
the entire period, and the remaining amount of such Taxes shall be
attributable to the Post-Closing Tax Period; and (b) in the case of all other
Taxes, the amount of Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be
determined as if a separate return was filed for the period ending as of the
end of the day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology,"
and the remaining amount of the Taxes for such period shall be attributable to
the Post-Closing Tax Period; provided, however, that for purposes of clause
(b), exemptions, allowances, or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis (including depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
in proportion to the number of days in each such period.

 

11.2Cooperation; Tax Actions

 

. Buyer and Sellers shall cooperate (i) in the preparation and timely filing
of any Tax Return relating to the EPSi Business, the Purchased Assets, or the
Transferring Employees; (ii) in any audit or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes or Tax Returns relating to the EPSi Business, the Purchased Assets, or
the Transferring Employees. Such cooperation shall include making available
any relevant information, records, or other documents relating to any Taxes or
Tax Returns relating to the EPSi Business, the Purchased Assets, or the
Transferring Employees. Buyer and Sellers also agree to provide certificates
or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate
to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax.

 

11.3Transfer Taxes

 

. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar
Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) (collectively, "Transfer
Taxes")

   

incurred in connection with the sale of the Purchased Assets to Buyer under
this Agreement shall be borne by Buyer, and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Taxes and fees,
provided that Sellers shall join in the execution of such Tax Returns or other
documentation to the extent required by applicable Law. Buyer shall promptly
pay when due all such required amounts to the appropriate Governmental
Authority.

 

11.4Allocation

 

.

 

(a)Within sixty (60) days of the final determination of the Final Closing Date
Net Working Capital, Buyer shall provide to Sellers a schedule allocating the
purchase price (including the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets
(the "Purchase Price Allocation Schedule").

 

(b)If within thirty (30) days of receiving the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, Sellers have not objected, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
shall be final and binding. If within thirty (30) days, Sellers object to the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate in good
faith to resolve their differences. If Sellers and Buyer are unable to resolve
any disputed items, then each Party may allocate the purchase price (including
the Assumed Liabilities) among the Purchased Assets as such Party believes is
appropriate.

 

(c)The Parties hereto shall make appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule to reflect changes in the purchase price. The Parties
hereto agree for all Tax reporting purposes to report the transactions in
accordance with the agreements herein and the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to the preceding sentence, (if agreed to by the
Parties) and to not take any position during the course of any audit or other
proceeding inconsistent with the agreements as to Tax treatment herein or with
such schedule unless required by a determination of the applicable
Governmental Authority that is final.

 

11.5Bulk Sales

 

. Buyer and Sellers hereby waive compliance with the provisions of any bulk
sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws of any jurisdiction that may otherwise be
applicable with respect to the sale of any or all of the Purchased Assets to
Buyer hereunder, it being understood and agreed that any Liabilities arising
out of any failure to comply with the requirements and provisions of any such
bulk sales, bulk transfer or similar Laws shall be treated as Excluded
Liabilities.

All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in any state or federal court sitting in the state of
Delaware. Consistent with the preceding sentence, each of the Parties hereby
(a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any federal or state court
sitting in the state of Delaware for the purpose of any Action arising out of

the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity
or enforceability of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement in any

Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party

12.16Disclosure Schedules

 

. The Schedules have been arranged, for purposes of convenience only, as
separately-titled Schedules corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Schedules or in this
Agreement or the omission of any cross reference thereto, the information and
disclosures contained in any Schedule shall be deemed to be disclosed and
incorporated by reference in any other Schedule as though fully set forth in
such Schedule for which applicability of such information and disclosure is
reasonably apparent on its face. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in any Schedule: (a) shall not be construed to mean that such
information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement; (b) shall not be
construed as or constitute an admission, evidence or agreement that a
violation, right of termination, default, non-compliance, Liability or other
obligation of any kind exists with respect to any item; (c) with respect to
the enforceability of Contracts with third parties, the existence or non-
existence of third party rights, the absence of breaches or defaults by third
parties, or similar matters or statements, is intended only to allocate rights
and risks among the Parties and is not intended to be admissions against
interests, give rise to any inference or proof of accuracy, be admissible
against any Party by any Person who is not a Party, or give rise to any claim
or benefit to any entity or person who is not a Party; (d) shall not be deemed
or interpreted to broaden or to narrow the representations and warranties,
obligations, covenants, conditions or agreements of Sellers contained in this
Agreement; and (e) does not waive any attorney-client privilege associated
with such item or information or any protection afforded by the work-product
doctrine with respect to any of the matters disclosed or discussed herein.
Unless the context otherwise requires (for example, a Schedule corresponds to
a representation and warranty that requires disclosure of information that is
"material" or that would reasonably be expected to constitute a "Material
Adverse Effect"), such information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein
shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms "material" or
"Material Adverse Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement. Neither
the specifications of any dollar amount in any representation, warranty or
covenant contained in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in
the Seller Disclosure Schedules is intended to imply that such amount, or
higher or lower amounts, or the item so included or other items, are or are
not material, and no Person shall use the fact of the setting forth of any
such amount or the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or controversy
between the Parties as to whether any obligation, item or matter not described
herein or included in the Seller Disclosure Schedules is or is not material
for purposes of this Agreement.

 

12.17Independent Legal Counsel; Continuing Representation

 

. Each Party has had the benefit of independent legal counsel with respect to
the preparation of this Agreement. This Agreement expresses the mutual intent
of the Parties and each Party has participated equally in its preparation.
Accordingly, the rule on construction against the drafting party shall have no
application to this Agreement. Each of the Parties hereby agrees, on its own
behalf and on behalf of its directors, managers, members, partners, officers,
employees and Affiliates, that Winston and Strawn LLP may serve as counsel to
each and any of Seller, the members of its board of managers, and its
Affiliates (individually and collectively, the "Seller Group") in connection
with the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and
that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Winston
and Strawn LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel

   

to the Seller Group or any director, manager, member, partner, officer,
employee or Affiliate of any member of the Seller Group, in connection with
any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding
such representation.

 

12.18Guarantee

 

. To induce Sellers to enter into this Agreement, the Guarantor hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees to Sellers, the full, complete and
punctual payment, if and when due, of all Obligations and whenever Buyer does
not pay or perform any of the Obligations in accordance with their respective
terms, the Guarantor shall, immediately on demand by Allscripts Healthcare,
pay or perform such Obligations as if it were the primary obligor primarily
liable for the performance thereof and not as a mere surety. The obligations
of the Guarantor pursuant to this Section 12.18 shall be continuing
obligations and shall not be satisfied, discharged or affected by any
intermediate payment or settlement of account or any change in the
constitution or control of, or the insolvency of, or any bankruptcy, winding

such time as Buyer does not pay or perform any Obligation.
