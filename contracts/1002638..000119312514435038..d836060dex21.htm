Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments (and shall give
Parent prompt telephonic notice of any material discussions with the SEC
staff), (2) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon
the responses to any such comments and a copy of any proposed written
responses thereto prior to the filing thereof and (3) give reasonable and
good faith consideration to any comments made by Parent on any such responses.
Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent
that such information shall have become false or misleading in any material
respect, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended
or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the holders of
Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by Applicable Law.

 

(c) _Stockholder Lists_. In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
instruct its transfer agent to furnish Merger Sub promptly (and in any event
no later than four (4) Business Days after the date of this Agreement) with
mailing labels containing the names and addresses of the record holders of
Shares as of the most recent practicable date and of those persons
becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all
lists of stockholders, security position listings and computer files and all
other information in the Companys possession or control regarding the
beneficial owners of the Shares, and shall furnish to Merger Sub such
information and assistance (including updated lists of stockholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the holders of 

 



17  Shares (the date of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer
Documents and the Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated, the " _Stockholder
List Date_ "). Subject to Applicable Law, and except for such steps as are
necessary to communicate the Offer to the holders of Shares, Parent and Merger
Sub and their Representatives (i) shall hold in confidence such lists, files
and information and will use such information only in connection with the
Offer and the Merger and (ii) following the termination of this Agreement,
shall promptly either deliver to the Company or destroy, and shall cause their
Representatives to deliver to the Company or destroy, all copies and any
extracts or summaries of such information then in their possession or control
and notify the Company that all such material has been so returned or
destroyed.

 

Section 2.03 _The Closing_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place
at 9:01 a.m., Eastern time, or as soon as practicable thereafter, on the date
of the consummation of the Offer, subject to satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions set forth in _Article 7_ (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing,
but subject to the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder)
of such conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to
its terms or unless another time and/or date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Cleary Gottlieb
Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York, unless another
place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.

Section 2.04 _The Merger_.

 

(a) _Effecting the Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, as soon as
practicable after the Closing, Parent and the Company shall cause a
certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed,
acknowledged and delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware for filing, all in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. The Merger shall be governed by and effected under
Section 251(h) of the DGCL without the adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of the Company.

 

(b) _Effective Time_. The Merger shall become effective on such date and at
such time as when the Certificate of Merger has been received for filing by
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time and date
as may be agreed by the parties hereto in writing and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

(c) _Surviving Corporation_. At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), and the separate
corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger.

(d) _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
the applicable provisions of the DGCL, this Agreement and the Certificate of
Merger.

 

Section 2.05 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company,
the stockholders thereof or

 



18  any other Person:

(a) except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.05(b)_,  _Section 2.05(c)_,
_Section 2.07_ or _Section 2.08_, each Share outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and converted into the right to
receive the Offer Price without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ ");

(b) each Share owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and no payment shall be
made with respect thereto, and each holder of a Certificate representing any
such Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto;

 

(c) each Share held by any wholly-owned Subsidiary of either the Company or
Parent (including Merger Sub), immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be cancelled without any conversion thereof and no payment or distribution
shall be made with respect thereto; and

(d) each share of common stock of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one fully paid,
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation, which shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 2.06 _Surrender and Payment_. 

(a) _Paying Agent and Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
appoint a paying agent reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for the Merger Consideration
certificates representing Shares (the " _Certificates_ ;" _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any references herein to "Certificates" are deemed to
include references to effective affidavits of loss in accordance with _Section
2.12_ or to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
Shares). As of the Effective Time, Parent shall have, or shall have taken all
steps necessary to enable and cause the Surviving Corporation to, deposit with
the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Certificates (the " _Payment Fund_ "). To the extent such fund diminishes
for any reason below the level required to make prompt payment of the Merger
Consideration, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall promptly replace or
restore the lost portion of such fund so as to ensure that it is, at all
times, maintained at a level sufficient to make such payments. Promptly after
the Effective Time and in any event no later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Paying Agent to
send, to each record holder of Shares at the Effective Time, in each case
whose Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to _Section 2.05(a)_, a letter of transmittal and instructions
(which shall specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss
and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery or transfer of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify (after due consultation with the
Company) prior to the consummation of the Offer) for use in such payment.

 



19 (b) _Surrender of Shares_. Each holder of Shares that have been converted into
the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration in respect of the Shares represented by a Certificate
promptly upon (i) surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate, together
with a duly completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such
other documents as may reasonably be requested by the Paying Agent, or (ii)
receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent (or such other evidence,
if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) in the case
of a book-entry transfer of Shares. Until so surrendered or transferred, each
such Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes
only the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be
paid or accrued on the cash payable upon the surrender or transfer of such
Certificate.

(c)  _Unregistered Transferees_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration
is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that (i)
either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in
proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay
to the Paying Agent any transfer or other Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
establish to the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid
or is not payable.

 

(d) _No Other Rights_. All Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate and, from and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the stock
transfer books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for
transfer, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide the holder of such Certificates with such
instructions as may be necessary to permit such holder to receive the Merger
Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to the Merger.

 

(e) _Termination of the Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund that
remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares six (6) months after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any such
holder who has not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance
with this _Section 2.06_ prior to that time shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation as general creditors thereof for payment of the
Merger Consideration.

 

Section 2.07 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding _Section 2.05_ or any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who is entitled
to appraisal and who has properly exercised appraisal rights for such shares
in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall
not be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration but instead
shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder
of Dissenting Shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if, after the Effective
Time, such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses such holders right to
appraisal, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL or if a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, such Shares shall immediately cease to be
Dissenting Shares and shall be treated as if they had been Shares converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive 

 



20  the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.05(a)_, without
interest thereon, upon surrender of such Certificate formerly representing
such Shares. The Company shall provide Parent prompt written notice of any
demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any
such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL that
relate to such demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Except with the prior written consent of Parent or if required by Applicable
Law, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or offer to
settle or settle, any such demands.

 

Section 2.08 _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock Units; Company
ESPP_.

 

(a) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, at the Effective Time
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders
thereof, each Company Stock Option, whether or not vested and exercisable,
that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall accelerate and be automatically converted into the right to receive
promptly after the Closing Date (and in any event no later than fifteen (15)
days following the Closing Date) an amount in cash equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the per share exercise price of such Company Stock Option, by (ii) the
aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon
exercise or settlement of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the
Effective Time (such product, the " _Cash Amount_ "). All payments provided
pursuant to this _Section 2.08(a)_ shall be subject to any applicable Tax
withholding requirements. If the exercise price per share of any Company Stock
Option equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration, the Cash Amount therefor
shall be zero.

(b) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, with respect to each
time-vested Company Restricted Stock Unit that has not vested as of the
Effective Time held by a non-employee director of the Company, at the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, each such Company Restricted Stock Unit shall become
fully vested and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse and such
Company Restricted Stock Unit will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration promptly after the Closing Date (and in any event no
later than fifteen (15) days following the Closing Date) in respect of each
share underlying the Company Restricted Stock Unit, subject to any applicable
Tax withholding requirements.

 

(c) The Company shall take all requisite action so that, with respect to each
time-vested Company Restricted Stock Unit that has not vested as of the
Effective Time held by holders other than the non-employee directors of the
Company, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of the holder thereof, each such Company Restricted Stock Unit
shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share underlying the Company Restricted Stock Unit (the "
_Parent Restricted Cash Award_ "), subject to the same terms and conditions
(including the vesting and settlement schedules and taking into account any
elective deferrals) as applied to such Company Restricted Stock Unit
immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that Parent shall be the
administrator of the Parent Restricted Cash Awards), subject to any
applicable Tax withholding requirements.

 



21  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any portion of the Parent Restricted Cash
Award that has not vested and has not been forfeited as of the first
anniversary of the Closing Date shall immediately vest in full on the first
anniversary of the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Change in
Control Agreements (as defined in the Company Disclosure Schedules) and any
acceleration benefits in connection with an "Involuntary Termination" (as
defined in the applicable Company Restricted Stock Unit grant agreement) shall
remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, the Company shall take all requisite action so that
each performance-vested Company Restricted Stock Unit that is subject to any
performance condition as of the date of this Agreement, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, shall be
cancelled as of the Effective Time without any consideration being payable in
respect thereof. _Section 2.08(c)(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules
sets forth the applicable vesting and settlement schedules with respect to
each such Company Restricted Stock Unit and whether such Company Restricted
Stock Unit is time-vested or performance-vested. _Section 2.08(c)(ii)_ of the
Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth each performance-vested Company
Restricted Stock Unit that is subject to any performance conditions as of the
date of this Agreement and that will be cancelled pursuant to this _Section
2.08(c)_ without any consideration being payable in respect thereof (the "
_Cancelled PSUs_ ").  _Section 2.08(c)(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedules sets forth each performance-vested Company Restricted Stock Unit
that is no longer subject to any performance conditions as of the date of this
Agreement (the " _Surviving PSUs_ "), which shall be subject to _Section
2.08(d)_. Other than the Cancelled PSUs and the Surviving PSUs, no
performance-based Company Restricted Stock Units were granted under the
Company Stock Plans or otherwise.

 

(d) With respect to each Company Restricted Stock Unit which is vested but not
settled, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each such Company Restricted Stock
Unit shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of each share underlying the Company Restricted Stock Unit, subject
to the terms and conditions (including the settlement schedule) as applied to
the Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time
(except that Parent shall be the administrator of the Company Restricted Stock
Units), subject to any applicable Tax withholding requirements. _Section
2.08(d)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules sets forth the settlement
schedule with respect to each such Company Restricted Stock Unit.

 

(e) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
shall take all reasonable actions, including adopting any necessary
resolution, to (i) terminate the Actuate Software Corporation 1998 Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") as of immediately prior to the
Closing Date, (ii) ensure that no offering period under the Company ESPP
shall be commenced on or after the date of this Agreement, (iii) if the
Closing shall occur prior to the end of the offering period in existence under
the Company ESPP on the date of this Agreement, cause a new exercise date to
be set under the Company ESPP, which date shall be the Business Day
immediately prior to the initial Offer Expiration Time, (iv) prohibit
participants in the Company ESPP from altering their payroll deductions from
those in effect on the date of this Agreement (other than to discontinue
their participation in the Company ESPP in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company ESPP) and (v) provide that the amount of the
accumulated contributions of each participant under the Company ESPP as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, to the extent not used to
purchase shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Company ESPP (as amended pursuant 

 



22  to this _Section 2.08(e)_), be refunded to such participant as promptly as
practicable following the Effective Time (without interest).

 

(f) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement and
in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt
such resolutions that are necessary for the treatment of the Company Equity
Awards pursuant to this _Section 2.08_. At or prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall terminate each Company Stock Plan and cancel each
Company Equity Award without any further liability on the part of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation, Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries as
necessary to effect the provisions of this _Section 2.08_.

Section 2.09 _Adjustments_. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend, all references herein to specified numbers of shares affected
thereby, and any calculations that are based upon such numbers of shares
affected thereby, including the Offer Price, the Merger Consideration and any
other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, shall be appropriately
adjusted.

Section 2.10 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
the consideration otherwise payable to any Person pursuant to this Agreement
such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold from such payment under
any provision of any applicable Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, as the case may be, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.11 _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any cash from the Payment Fund delivered to a public official
pursuant to and in accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat
or similar Applicable Law. If any Certificate shall not have been
surrendered immediately prior to such date on which any amounts payable
pursuant to this _Article 2_ would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Authority, any such amounts shall, to the extent permitted
by Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.12 _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will
issue, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the

 



23  Shares formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated under this
_Article 2_.

 

Section 2.13 _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of Shares shall
thereafter be made.

and delivered this Agreement and, assuming due authorization, execution and

Section 6.02 _Unsolicited Proposals_.

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.02_, from the date of
this Agreement until the consummation of the Offer or, if earlier, the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company will
not, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and their

 



57  respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) initiate,
solicit or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that
could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) other than informing Third Parties of the existence of the
provisions contained in this _Section 6.02_ , engage in negotiations or
discussions with, or furnish any information concerning the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries to, any Third Party relating to an Acquisition
Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that could
reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition Proposal or
(iii) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing. Promptly following the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall (A) cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions or negotiations of the Company, its
Affiliates and its and their Representatives with any Person conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
proposal that could reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in,
an Acquisition Proposal, (B) terminate access by any Third Party to any
physical or electronic data room relating to any potential Acquisition
Transaction, (C) request the prompt return or destruction of any confidential
information provided to any Third Party in the twelve (12) months immediately
preceding the date of this Agreement in connection with a proposed Acquisition
Transaction and (D) enforce the provisions of any existing confidentiality or
non-disclosure agreement entered into with respect to any potential
Acquisition Transaction ( _provided_ that the Company shall be permitted to
grant waivers of, and not enforce, any standstill provision to the extent that
such provision would otherwise prohibit the counterparty thereto from making
a confidential Acquisition Proposal directly to the Company Board for a
negotiated Acquisition Transaction in accordance with the terms of this
_Section 6.02_). It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in this _Section 6.02(a)_ by any Representative of the Company or any
of its Affiliates shall constitute a breach of this _Section 6.02(a)_ by the
Company.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
prior to the consummation of the Offer, the Company receives an unsolicited
written Acquisition Proposal (which Acquisition Proposal was made after the
date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this _Section
6.02_), the Company and the Company Board and/or their Representatives
may, subject to compliance with this _Section 6.02(b)_, engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any information and reasonable
access to, any Third Party making such Acquisition Proposal and/or its
Representatives or potential financing sources if the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Companys outside legal
and financial advisors, and based on information then available, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result
in, a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that (i) prior to furnishing any
material nonpublic information, the Company receives from such Third Party an
executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (ii) any such material
nonpublic information so furnished has been previously provided or made
available to Parent or is provided or made available (including through the
Data Room) to Parent promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after it is so furnished to such Third Party. In addition to the
foregoing provisions in this _Section 6.02(b)_, the Company may, following
the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, contact such Third Party solely to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions thereof to facilitate the
Company Boards determination with respect to whether such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior
Proposal. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the immediately preceding
sentence shall allow the Company or any of its Representatives to negotiate or
suggest improvements to the terms of

 



58  such Acquisition Proposal.

(c) Except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this _Section
6.02(c)_ or _Section 6.02(d)_, until the termination of this Agreement,
neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw (or
qualify or modify in any manner adverse to Parent), or publicly propose to
withdraw (or so qualify or modify), the Board Recommendation, (B) take any
action to exempt any Person (other than Parent and its Affiliates) from the
provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL or any other applicable state takeover
statute, (C) fail to publicly reaffirm the Board Recommendation within three
(3) Business Days after Parent so requests in writing, (D) fail to recommend,
in a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal or
(E) approve, adopt or recommend any Acquisition Proposal, or propose publicly
to approve, adopt or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action described
in this clause (i) being referred to as a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") or
(ii) allow the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint
venture agreement, alliance agreement, partnership agreement or similar
agreement or arrangement (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement)
with any Third Party relating to an Acquisition Proposal or potential
Acquisition Transaction, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the
Company to abandon, terminate, delay or fail to consummate, or that would
otherwise impede or interfere with the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, or requiring, or reasonably expected to cause, the Company to
fail to comply with this Agreement (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_
"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the consummation of the Offer, in the event a material
development or material change in circumstances (other than an Acquisition
Proposal) occurs or arises after the date of this Agreement that was not known
and not reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of the date of this
Agreement, the Company Board may make a Change in Recommendation (under
clause (A) or (D) of the definition thereof) if the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of the Company under Applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Company has provided Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice
advising Parent that it intends to take such action and specifying, in
reasonable detail, the reasons for such action.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement (but
subject to compliance with _Section 6.02(e)_), at any time prior to the
consummation of the Offer if, in response to an unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that did not result
from a breach of this _Section 6.02_, the Company Board determines in
good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel and financial
advisor) that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (ii) the failure to approve or recommend such Superior Proposal would be
inconsistent with the Company Boards fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company under Applicable Law, the Company may terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section 6.02(d)_; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 8.01(d)(i)_ and this _Section 6.02(d)_ unless the Company (A) has
complied with its obligations set forth in _Section 6.02(e)_, (B) pays, or
causes to be paid, to Parent, the Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section
9.04(b)_ prior to or concurrently with such termination and (C) concurrently
with such termination, enters 

 



59  into a definitive Alternative Acquisition Agreement that documents the terms
and conditions of such Superior Proposal.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section 8.01(d)(i)_ (x) unless the Company shall have
provided to Parent four (4) Business Days prior written notice (the "
_Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent that the Company intends to
take such action (and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons for such
action and the material terms and conditions of any such Superior Proposal)
and, if applicable, a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreement,
and (y):

(i) during such four (4) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall have engaged in good faith negotiations with Parent regarding
changes to the terms of this Agreement intended to cause such Acquisition
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; and

 

(ii) the Company shall have considered any adjustments to this Agreement
(including a change to the price terms hereof) and any other agreements that
may be irrevocably proposed in writing by Parent (the most recent such
adjustments, the " _Proposed Changed Terms_ ") no later than 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on the fourth (4th) Business Day of such four (4) Business
Day period and shall have determined in good faith (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that the Superior Proposal
would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal if the Proposed Changed
Terms were to be given effect.

For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent, within four (4) Business Days following
its receipt of a Superior Proposal Notice makes an offer that, as determined
in good faith by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors) results in the applicable Acquisition Proposal
no longer being a Superior Proposal, then the Company shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 6.02(d)_ or _Section
8.01(d)(i)_ as a result of such Acquisition Proposal. Any (1) material
revisions to the terms of a Superior Proposal or (2) material revisions to an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board had determined no longer
constitutes a Superior Proposal shall constitute a new Acquisition Proposal
and shall in each case require the Company to deliver to Parent a new Superior
Proposal Notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that the four (4) Business Day
periods in this _Section 6.02(e)_ otherwise applicable to such revised
Superior Proposal shall thereafter instead be two (2) Business Day periods.

 

(f) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) advise
Parent orally or in writing in the event that the Company receives any
Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry, proposal or request for information that
would reasonably be expected to lead to, or result in, an Acquisition
Proposal, and in connection with such notice, if applicable, provide to Parent
the material terms and conditions (including the identity of the Third Party
making any such Acquisition Proposal) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The
Company shall (i) promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours)
notify Parent of any material change to the material terms of any such
Acquisition Proposal or any determination by the Company Board pursuant to
_Section 6.02(b)_, (ii) promptly notify Parent of (A) any material
negotiation sessions between such Third Party or its Representatives on the
one hand, and the Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, including
providing a summary of all material items

 



60  discussed in such negotiation session and (B) if the Company or such Third
Party has decided to not pursue such Acquisition Proposal and (iii) provide to
Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within twenty-four (24)
hours) after receipt or delivery thereof of any written indication of interest
(or amendment thereto) or any written material that constitutes an offer (or
amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed Alternative Acquisition
Agreements and any financing commitments related thereto.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through their respective
Representatives, from (i) taking and disclosing any position or disclosing any
information reasonably required under Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2(a) or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making
any "stop, look and listen" communication to the Companys stockholders
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act;  _provided_ ,
that no such action or disclosure shall limit the effect of _Section
6.02(c)_.

Section 6.03 _Approval of Merger_. The Merger shall be governed by and
effected under Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall be effected by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company as soon as practicable following the consummation
of the Offer, without a stockholders meeting, pursuant to Section 251(h) of
the DGCL.

Section 6.04 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to Applicable Law, upon reasonable notice to the Company, the
Company shall (and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and the officers,
directors and agents of the Company and each Company Subsidiary to) afford
Parents officers and Parents other authorized Representatives reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the Pre-Closing Period, to
its officers, agents, properties, books, Contracts and records, and, with the
Companys consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), to the employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries; and
shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub all financial, operating and other data
and information as Parent and Merger Sub through their officers, employees or
agents, may reasonably request. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
and any Representative of the Company shall be required to provide access to
or to disclose information where such access or disclosure would (i)
contravene any Applicable Law, Contract of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary or Order or (ii) would reasonably be expected to violate or result
in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege
_provided_ that (A) the Company, each Company Subsidiary and each of their
Representatives have taken all reasonable steps to provide access to or to
disclose such information on a basis that does not contravene Applicable Law,
Contract or Order or to preserve or waive the Companys privilege with respect
thereto and (B) such access and information shall be granted or made
available, as applicable, to external counsel for Parent (subject to external
counsel entering into a customary common interest agreement with the Company,
on terms mutually agreeable to Parent and the Company).

 

(b) No information or knowledge obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
_Section 6.02_, this _Section 6.04_ or otherwise shall affect or be deemed
to affect or modify any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made
by the Company contained herein, the conditions to the obligations of the
parties to consummate the Merger in accordance with the 

 



61  terms and provisions hereof or otherwise prejudice in any way the rights and
remedies of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, nor shall any such information,
knowledge or investigation be deemed to affect or modify Parents or Merger
Subs reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements
made by the Company in this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agrees that all
information provided to it or any of its Representatives by the Company or
any of its Representatives, on the one hand, or Parent and Merger Sub, on the
other hand, in connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions shall be deemed to be provided under, and shall be treated in
accordance with, the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 6.05 _Notice of Certain Events_. During the Pre-Closing Period, each
party hereto shall promptly notify the other in writing of:

(a) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person alleging that the consent, approval, permission
or of waiver from such party is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions;

 

(b) any notice or other communication received by such party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Transactions;

(c) any Stockholder Litigation; and

 

(d) any fact, event or circumstance known to it that would be reasonably
likely to result in (i) the material failure of any representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be true or accurate at
or prior to the Closing, (ii) any material failure of such party to comply
with any of such partys covenants or agreements hereunder or (iii) the
failure of any of the conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ or in _Article 7_ to
be satisfied; _provided_ , that the failure to deliver any notice pursuant to
this _Section 6.05_ shall not be considered in determining whether the
conditions set forth on _Exhibit A_ or in _Article 7_ have been satisfied;

_provided_ , _however_ , that that no notification given by any party
pursuant to this _Section 6.05_ shall (A) limit or otherwise affect any of
the representations, warranties, covenants, obligations or conditions
contained in this Agreement, (B) otherwise prejudice in any way the rights
and remedies contained in this Agreement, (C) be deemed to affect or modify
such partys reliance on the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements made by the other parties in this Agreement or (D) be deemed to
amend or supplement the Company Disclosure Schedules or prevent or cure any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or breach of covenant by such party.

 

Section 6.06 _Employee Benefit Plan Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to employees of the Company
or the Company Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time who are
employed by the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of the Surviving
Corporation immediately following the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_
"), Parent shall cause the service of each such Continuing Employee with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date to be
recognized for purposes of eligibility to participate, levels of benefits (but
not for benefit accruals or participation eligibility under any defined
benefit pension plan or plan

 



62  providing post-retirement medical or other similar benefits) and vesting
under each compensation, vacation, fringe or other welfare benefit plan,
program or arrangement of the Surviving Corporation, but not including any
sabbatical or equity compensation plans, programs, agreements or arrangements
(collectively, the " _Parent Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Continuing
Employee is or becomes eligible to participate, but solely to the extent
service was credited to such employee for such purposes under a comparable
Company Employee Plan immediately prior to the Closing Date and to the extent
such credit would not result in a duplication of benefits.

 

(b) For a period of 12 months immediately following the Closing Date, Parent
shall provide benefits (excluding any equity or equity-based plan, program or
arrangement) for Continuing Employees who are not covered by a labor agreement
at least as favorable in the aggregate as the benefits (excluding any equity
or equity-based plan, program or arrangement) that such Continuing
Employees had at the Company immediately prior to the Closing Date.

(c) From and after the Closing Date, with respect to each Parent Benefit
Plan that is an "employee welfare benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(1) of
ERISA in which any Continuing Employee is or becomes eligible to participate,
Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such Parent
Benefit Plan to (i) waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions,
waiting periods, required physical examinations and exclusions with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable under such Parent Benefit
Plan for such Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the same
extent that such pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, required physical
examinations and exclusions would not have applied or would have been waived
under the corresponding Company Employee Plan in which such Continuing
Employee was a participant immediately prior to his commencement of
participation in such Parent Benefit Plan but only to the extent permitted
under the terms and conditions of Parents applicable insurance contracts in
effect as of the Closing Date and (ii) to the extent permitted under the
applicable Parent Benefit Plan, credit co-payments or deductibles paid by
Continuing Employees in the plan year in which the Closing occurs for
purposes of satisfying any deductible or co-payment requirements under the
applicable Parent Benefit Plan.

 

(d) No later than twenty (20) Business Days following the date of this
Agreement, with respect to each "officer" of the Company (as defined in Rule
16a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act) (each a " _Section 16 Officer_")
and any other "disqualified individual" of the Company (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code), the Company shall furnish a schedule that sets forth
(i) the Companys reasonable, good faith estimate of the maximum amount
(separately identifying single and double-trigger amounts and any tax gross-up
payments) that could be paid to such Section 16 Officer or other disqualified
individual as a result of any of the Transactions (alone or in combination
with any other event), (ii) the "base amount" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(3) of the Code) for each such Section 16 Officer or other
disqualified individual, and (iii) underlying documentation on which such
calculations are based. The schedules and underlying documentation required by
this _Section 6.06(d)_ shall be updated and delivered to Parent not later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date.

(e) Parent, the Company and the Surviving Corporation acknowledge and agree
that all provisions contained in this _Section 6.06_ are included for the
sole benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement and shall not create
any right in any other Person, including any 

 



63  Company Employee, any participant in any Company Employee Plan or Parent
Benefit Plan or any beneficiary thereof or any right to continued employment
with Parent, Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates.
Nothing in this _Section 6.06_ shall be deemed to amend any Company Benefit
Plan, any Parent Benefit Plan or to require Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their Affiliates to permit any Person to participate in any
particular benefit plan sponsored or maintained by Parent or any of its
Affiliates, or to continue or amend any particular benefit plan, before or
after the consummation of the Transactions, and any such plan may be amended
or terminated in accordance with its terms and Applicable Law.

(f) Following the Closing, Parent shall take the actions set forth on
_Section 6.06(f)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedules.

Section 6.07 _State Takeover Laws_. If any "control share acquisition,"
"business combination," "fair price," "moratorium" or other anti-takeover
Applicable Law becomes or is deemed to be applicable to the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub, the Merger or any other Transaction, then each of the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub, and their respective Boards of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the Transactions may
be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby
and otherwise act to render such anti-takeover Applicable Law inapplicable to
the foregoing.

Section 6.08  _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to
perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Offer and
the Merger on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.09 _Stock Exchange Delisting; Director Resignations_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or
cause to be done all things, reasonably requested by Parent under Applicable
Law and rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the
Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time.

(b) At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of the directors of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries (other than directors of the Company Subsidiaries
whom Parent determines shall continue to serve in such capacities
following the Effective Time), effective at the Effective Time.

Section 6.10 _Director and Officer Liability_.

 

(a) For six (6) years after the Effective Time, Surviving Corporation shall
maintain officers and directors liability insurance in respect of acts or
omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such person
currently covered by the Companys officers and directors liability
insurance policy on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less
favorable than those of such policy in effect on the date of this Agreement;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation under this _Section
6.10(a)_, Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to pay annual premiums
in excess of 200% of the amount per annum the Company

 



64  paid in its last full fiscal year prior to the date of this Agreement (the "
_Current Premium_ ") and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed 200% of the Current Premium, then the Surviving Corporation shall
cause to be maintained policies of insurance that, in the Surviving
Corporations good faith judgment, provide the maximum coverage available at
an annual premium equal to 200% of the Current Premium. The provisions of the
immediately preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if
prepaid "tail" or "runoff" policies have been obtained by the Company prior to
the Effective Time, which policies provide such directors and officers with
coverage for an aggregate period of six (6) years with respect to claims
arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time,
including, in respect of the Transactions, _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the
amount paid for such prepaid policies does not exceed 200% of the Current
Premium. If such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full
force and effect for their full term, and continue to honor the obligations
thereunder.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall (and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to) fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries pursuant
to (i) each indemnification agreement in effect between the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries and any individual who at the Effective Time is, or
at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director or officer of the
Company or of a Company Subsidiary (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ,"
and each such indemnification agreement, a " _D andO Indemnification
Agreement_")); and (ii) any indemnification provision and any exculpation
provision set forth in the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the
Company or other similar organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary
as in effect on the date of this Agreement. For a period of six (6) years from
and after the Effective Time, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws (and other similar organizational
documents) of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses of directors and officers of the Company for periods
at or prior to the Effective Time than are currently set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and in the bylaws of the Company. To the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the DandO Indemnification Agreements
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms
following the Effective Time.

(c) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this  _Section 6.10_.

(d) The provisions of this _Section 6.10_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such individual may have under the articles of organization or bylaws, by

65 Section 6.11 _Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company and
Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate
with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary under
Applicable Law to consummate the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental
Authorities, the expiry or early termination of any applicable waiting
periods, and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including
filings with Governmental Authorities, if any) and the taking of such
commercially reasonable steps as may be reasonably necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Authorities, (ii) the delivery of required notices to, and the
obtaining of required consents or waivers from, Third Parties and (iii) the

consent confirmed in writing), (ii) provide or cause to be provided as

Section 6.12 _Payoff of Existing Company Indebtedness_. The Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to (i) obtain customary payoff letters acceptable to

which payoff letters together with any related release documentation shall,
among other things, include the payoff amount and provide in substance
reasonably acceptable to Parent, among other things, that Liens and
guarantees, if any, granted in connection therewith related to the assets,
rights and properties of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries securing
such indebtedness for borrowed money and any other obligations secured thereby

with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions and shall not issue any
such press release or make any such other public statement without the
consent of the other party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, except as such release or announcement that Parent or
the Company determines, after consultation with outside legal counsel, is
required by Applicable Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any
national or foreign securities exchange or association upon which the
securities of the Company or Parent, as applicable, are listed, in which case
the party required to make the release or announcement shall, to the extent
reasonably practicable, consult with the other party about, and shall use its
commercially resonable efforts to allow the other party reasonable time
(taking into account the circumstances) to comment on, such release or
announcement in advance of such issuance, and the party will consider such
comments in good faith; _provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company shall not be required to consult with Parent before
issuing any press release or making any other public statement with respect to
a Change in Recommendation effected in accordance with _Section 6.02(c)_ or

otherwise be subject to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act, to be exempt under
Exchange Act Rule 16b-3.

Section 6.16  _Approval of Compensation Arrangements_. Prior to the

which Parent has not theretofore been reimbursed by the Company (the "
_Parent Expenses_ "). Such expenses shall include all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses (including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment

9.04(h)_) and other than with respect to an Intentional Breach of this
Agreement by the Company, in the event that the Termination Fee and/or the
Parent Expenses are paid by the Company as required by this _Section 9.04_,
Parents right to receive payment from the Company of the Termination Fee
and/or the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section 9.04_ shall constitute
the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates and
Representatives against the Company and its Subsidiaries and any of their
respective former, current or future Representatives, general or limited
partners, stockholders, members, managers, employees, Affiliates or assignees
(collectively, the " _Company-Related Parties_ ") for all damages, costs,
fees, expenses, Liabilities, penalties or losses of any kind suffered as a
result of or in connection with this Agreement

sentence of _Section 9.04(e)_; and _provided_ ,  _further_ , that nothing in
this _Section 9.04(h)_ shall limit any right or remedy of Parent or Merger

relieve the Company of any Liability with respect to its Intentional Breach
of this Agreement.

notice to the Company, may assign, in its sole discretion, any of or all its
rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to Parent or to any
direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent; and (ii) no such
assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub of any of its obligations
hereunder.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, is intended to confer on any
Person other than the parties hereto or their respective successors, and
permitted assigns any rights, remedies, obligations or liabilities under or by
reason of this Agreement, except for the provisions of _Section 6.10_ and 
_Section 8.02_, which shall inure to the benefit of the Persons or entities
benefiting therefrom who are expressly intended to be third-party
beneficiaries thereof and who may enforce the covenants contained therein. For
the avoidance of doubt, no holder of Shares shall have any third-party
beneficiary rights under this _Section 9.05_ or any other provision of this
Agreement.

 

Section 9.06 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any Proceedings arising out
of or related hereto or to the Transactions or to the inducement of any party

and performance, without regard to the conflicts of law rules of such State

court therefrom. Each Party hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such court in respect of any legal or equitable Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions, or relating
to enforcement of any of the terms of this Agreement, and hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any such Proceeding, any claim that it
is not subject personally to the

 



74  jurisdiction of such court, that the Proceeding is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of the Proceeding is improper or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each
Party agrees that notice or the service of process in any Proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions shall be properly
served or delivered if delivered in the manner contemplated by  _Section

IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING OR

PARTY HERETO IN NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE OR ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF.

limitations set forth in this Agreement). The parties hereto further agree
that (i) by seeking the remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_, a
party shall not in any respect waive its right to seek any other form of
relief that may be available to a party under this Agreement (including
monetary damages) for breach of any of the provisions of this Agreement or in
the event that this Agreement has been terminated or in the event that the
remedies provided for in this _Section 9.09_ are not available or otherwise
are not granted, and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section 9.09_ shall
require any party hereto to institute any Proceeding for (or limit any partys
right to institute any Proceeding for) specific performance under this
_Section 9.09_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right
under _Article 8_ (and pursuing damages after such termination), nor shall the
commencement of any Proceeding pursuant to this _Section 9.09_ or anything
set forth in this _Section 9.09_ restrict or limit any partys right to
terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Article 8_ or pursue
any other remedies under this Agreement that may be available at any time.

 

Section 9.10 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction

any portion of businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their

businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their repective
Subsidiaries;

(B) any Proceeding shall have been commenced and be pending by any United

_Section 4.01_,  _Section 4.03_ or _Section 4.27_ of the Merger Agreement
shall not be true and correct in all respects as of the date of the Merger
Agreement and as of such time, except to the extent such representation and
warranty expressly relates to an earlier time (in which case on and as of
such earlier time) or (y) in _Section 4.06(a)_ or _Section 4.06(c)_ of the

be true and correct that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had a
Company Material Adverse Effect (it being understood that for this purpose

disregarded);

any obligation or to comply in any material respect with any agreement or
covenant of the Company to be performed or complied with by it under the
Merger Agreement prior to such time; or

discretion of Parent or Merger Sub, subject in each case to the terms of the
Merger Agreement and Applicable Law. The foregoing conditions set forth in
clauses (i) and (iv) may only be waived with the prior written consent of the
Company. Any reference in this _Exhibit A_ or in the Merger Agreement to a
condition or requirement being satisfied shall be deemed met if such condition
or requirement is so waived. The foregoing conditions shall be in addition
to, and not a limitation of, the rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend,
terminate and/or modify the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement or Applicable Law. The failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any
other Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right, the waiver of any such right
with respect to particular facts and circumstances shall not be deemed a
waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances and each such right
shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time and from
time to time.

 

Capitalized terms used in this _Exhibit A_ but not defined herein shall have
the meanings set forth in the agreement to which it is attached, except
