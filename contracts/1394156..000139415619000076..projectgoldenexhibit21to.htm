Any holder of Shares (other than Cancelled Shares) who has not theretofore  complied with this Article II shall thereafter be entitled to look to the Surviving Corporation for  payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax  withholdings as provided in Section 2.3(e)) upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of  loss in lieu of the Certificates) or acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares, without any interest  thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 2.3(b), and Parent shall remain  liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) payment of  their claim for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable upon due surrender of their  Certificates or Book-Entry Share.
