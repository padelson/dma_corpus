Purchase Price_ "). Sellers calculations set forth in the Estimated Closing

4  forth in _Exhibit A_ of this Agreement), and Buyers and their Affiliates and
their respective accountants and other representatives shall be entitled to

(iii) Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Closing Statement, Seller
may provide written notice to the U.S. Buyer disputing all or a part of the
Buyer Purchase Price Calculations (such notice, a " _Purchase Price Dispute
Notice_ "). If Seller does not provide a Purchase Price Dispute Notice to the
U.S. Buyer within such sixty (60)-day period, then the parties agree that the
Buyer Purchase Price Calculations set forth in the applicable Closing
Statement shall become final and binding on the parties hereto. If a Purchase
Price Dispute Notice is provided to the U.S. Buyer, then the U.S. Buyer and

to the U.S. Buyer and Seller (in either case, the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The
parties agree to instruct the Accounting Firm to render a determination of the
applicable dispute within forty-five (45) days after referral of the matter to
such Accounting Firm, which determination must be in writing and must set
forth, in reasonable detail, the basis therefor. The terms of appointment and
engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as agreed upon between Seller and
the U.S. Buyer, and any associated engagement fees shall be initially borne
50% by Seller and 50% by the U.S. Buyer; _provided_ that such fees shall
ultimately be borne by Seller and the U.S. Buyer in inverse proportion as they
may prevail on matters resolved by the Accounting Firm, which
proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the Accounting Firm at
the time the determination of the Accounting Firm is rendered on the merits of
the disputed items. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, all other
costs and expenses incurred by the parties hereto in connection with
resolving any dispute hereunder before the Accounting Firm shall be borne by
the party incurring such cost and expense. In resolving the disputed items,
the Accounting Firm: (1) shall be bound by the provisions of this _Section_

value claimed for such item or less than the smallest value for such item
claimed by either the U.S. Buyer or Seller; (3) shall rely solely on the
written submissions of the parties and shall not conduct an independent
investigation; (4) shall limit its decision to such items as are in dispute
and to only those adjustments as are necessary for the Buyer Purchase Price
Calculations to comply with the provisions of this Agreement; and (5) shall
act as an expert and not as an arbitrator. Such determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

 

(v) The parties agree that they will, and agree to cause their respective
independent accountants and their respective Affiliates to, cooperate and
assist in the calculation of the Final Purchase Price and in the conduct of
the review by the Accounting Firm of any proposed calculations of the Final
Purchase Price or the 

 



5  components thereof, including the making available, to the extent necessary,
of books, records, work papers and personnel.

 

(vi) Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Final
Purchase Price is determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_:

(1) if the Final Purchase Price is greater than the Estimated Purchase
Price, then the U.S. Buyer shall pay to Seller or other parties designated by
Seller, a cash amount equal to such excess, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the Seller Designated Account(s) (or such other accounts
as Seller shall designate in writing to the U.S. Buyer); or

(2) if the Estimated Purchase Price is greater than the Final Purchase
Price, then Seller or its designees shall pay to the U.S. Buyer a cash amount
equal to such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account that the U.S. Buyer designates in writing to Seller,

_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent any portion of the amounts payable
as reflected on the Closing Statement is not disputed pursuant to a Dispute
Notice, such undisputed portion shall be paid by the applicable party within
three (3) Business Days after receipt of the Dispute Notice.

 

(vii) Any amount paid pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_ shall
be: (1) increased by an amount calculated as interest on such amount at the
Applicable Rate from the Closing Date to and including the date of payment
based on a three hundred sixty-five (365)-day year; (2) made by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated by the receiving
party; and (3) treated as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax
reporting purposes.

(d) _Accounting Procedures_. The Buyer Purchase Price Calculations and the
components thereof (as set forth in the Closing Statement), shall be
determined based on consolidated balance sheets for the Transferred Entities
as at the Calculation Time, and prepared in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_  (as applicable); except that such
statements, calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include any
purchase accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) shall be based on facts and
circumstances as they exist as at the Calculation Time and shall exclude the
effect of any act, decision or event occurring after such time; (iii) shall
follow the defined terms contained in this Agreement whether or not such
terms are consistent with GAAP; and (iv) shall calculate any reserves,
accruals or other non-cash expense items on a daily accrual (as opposed to
monthly accrual) basis to account for a Calculation Time that occurs on any
date other than the last day of a calendar month. For the avoidance of doubt:
(1) in the event that there is any inconsistency between the Accounting
Principles, on the one hand, and the methodologies, rules,
example calculations and notes reflected in _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ (as
applicable), on the other hand, the methodologies, rules, example calculations
and notes reflected in _Exhibit A_ or _Exhibit B_ (as applicable) shall
apply; and (2) no amount shall be double-counted in calculating the amounts
comprising either the Estimated Purchase Price or the Final Purchase Price.

Transferred Entities contemplated in this Agreement are exempted from VAT in

transactions concerning the European Transferred Entities contemplated in this
Agreement.

 

(iii) To the extent any transaction contemplated in this Agreement
concerning the European Transferred Entities is subject to VAT, the VAT
amount shall be paid by Buyers in addition to the Final Purchase Price in
respect of the European Transferred Entities. VAT is due for payment as soon
as Buyers have received from Seller an invoice which complies with the
provisions of sec. 14 German VAT Code ( _Umsatzsteuergesetz_ ) or a respective
other applicable foreign tax provision.

 

Section 1.4 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Agreement, any party making a payment under this Agreement shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from such payment the amounts required to be
deducted and withheld under the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal,
state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if either
party becomes aware that any amount is required to be so withheld, it shall
promptly notify the other party of any such required withholding and the
parties shall cooperate with each other in good faith (including by taking
all reasonable actions requested by the other party to the extent such actions
would not reasonably be expected to have an adverse impact on the requested
party) to minimize or eliminate such withholding Taxes to the extent permitted
by applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ that Buyers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to give written notice to Seller of any actual
withholding from any payment made pursuant to this _ARTICLE 1_ as soon
as reasonably practicable. Any amounts so withheld, to the extent paid over
to the appropriate Tax Authority, shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

Section 1.5 _Tax Allocation_. The parties hereto agree that for purposes
of the Code, or any provision of any U.S. federal, state, local or foreign
Tax Law, the Estimated Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Companies
(and any direct or indirect Subsidiary of such Company) in accordance with
__Schedule 1.5__ (the " _Company Allocation Schedule_ "). The parties hereto
shall make appropriate adjustments to the Company Allocation Schedule to
reflect changes in the Purchase Price pursuant to the methodology as reflected
in __Schedule 1.5__. The parties hereto agree for all Tax reporting purposes
to report the transactions in accordance with the agreements herein and the
Company Allocation Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to the preceding sentence,
and to not take any position during the course of any audit or other
proceeding inconsistent with the agreements as to Tax treatment or the Company
Allocation Schedule, as adjusted pursuant to the preceding sentence, unless
required by a determination of the applicable Governmental Authority that is
final.

Material Contract or otherwise modify any material terms thereof in a
manner materially adverse to the Transferred Entity party thereto. To the
Knowledge of Seller, no event or circumstance has occurred that, with notice
or lapse of time or both: (i) would constitute an event of default under a
Material Contract or result in a termination thereof; or (ii) would cause or
permit the acceleration of, or other changes of or to, any right or obligation
or the loss of any benefit under a Material Contract, except, in each case, as
would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse, individually or in
the aggregate, to the Transferred Entities or the ongoing conduct of the
Business by the Transferred Entities.

 

Section 2.10 _Properties_.

 

(a) _Owned Real Property_. _Section 2.10(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter_ sets forth a list of all Owned Real Property. The Transferred
Entities own good and marketable fee simple title to the Owned Real Property
or, with regard to the Owned Real Property situated in Germany, the full and
unrestricted ownership ( _volleigentum_ ) of the Owned Real Property, which
shall be free and clear of all Liens, except for Permitted Liens, at the
Closing. Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.10(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_, no Transferred Entity has leased, subleased or otherwise
granted to any Person the right to use or occupy the Owned Real Property or
any portion thereof. Other than the right of Buyers pursuant to this
Agreement, there are no outstanding options, rights of first offer or rights
of first refusal to purchase the Owned Real Property or any portion thereof
or interest therein. No Transferred Entity is a party to any agreement or
option to purchase any real property or interest therein relating to the
Business. The ownership, occupancy, use and operation of the Owned Real
Property does not violate in any material respect any instrument of record or
agreement affecting such property. There are no appropriation, condemnation,
eminent domain or like proceedings relating to the Owned Real Property
pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened in writing.

(b) _Leased Real Property_.  _Section_ __ _ 2.10(b) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a list of all leases, subleases, licenses and/or
occupancy agreements for any real property pursuant to which a Transferred
Entity is a tenant, subtenant, licensee, occupant, lessor or sublessor,
excluding any such leases involving annual rental payments of less than
$250,000 that are not for a manufacturing facility and any leases that are not
for a manufacturing facility that have a term of one year or less or that are
terminable by such Transferred Entity at any time upon notice within one year
or less without any penalty (each, a " _Real Property Lease_ " and
collectively, the " _Real Property Leases_ ," and the parcel of property with
respect thereto, the " _Leased Real Property_ "). With respect to each parcel
of Leased Real Property:

 

(i) such Leased Real Property has been maintained in all material respects
in accordance with the applicable Real Property Lease;

 



14 (ii) to the Knowledge of Seller, no security deposit or portion thereof
deposited with respect to any Real Property Lease has been applied in respect
of a breach or default under such Real Property Lease which has not been
redeposited in full;

 

(iii) to the Knowledge of Seller, there are no condemnation or
expropriation claims pending or threatened in writing against or affecting
the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or interest therein;

 

(iv) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred
Entity) owes, or will owe in the future, any brokerage commissions or
finders fees with respect to such Real Property Lease;

 

(v) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates (including any Transferred
Entity) has collaterally assigned or granted any other security interest in
such Real Property Lease or any interest therein; and

 

(vi) the Leased Real Property and each Transferred Entitys use and
operation thereof complies in all material respects with all insurance
requirements applicable to said buildings and improvements.

(c) None of the Owned Real Property or the Leased Real Property has
suffered any material damage by fire or other casualty that is not covered by
insurance which has not heretofore been repaired and restored in all material
respects. The Owned Real Property and the Leased Real Property (together with
the real property leased by any Transferred Entity and not constituting Leased
Real Property hereunder) constitute all interests in real property currently
used, occupied or currently held for use in connection with the Business and
which are necessary for the continued operation of the Business as currently
conducted by the Transferred Entities, except for any real property to be made
available to Buyers pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement. There are
no physical, structural or mechanical defects in any of the buildings,
building systems or improvements on any of the Owned Real Property or Leased
Real Property which would materially impair the current use of such Owned
Real Property or Leased Real Property by the applicable Transferred Entity
and the Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property and all such buildings,
building systems and improvements (including the roof, HVAC, electrical,
plumbing, sprinklers and fire safety systems) are in an operating condition
and repair in all material respects that are sufficiently adequate for the
uses to which they are currently being put.

 

(d) _Personal Property_. The Transferred Entities have good and valid
title to, or otherwise have the right to use pursuant to a valid and
enforceable lease or similar Contract, all of their respective tangible assets
that are material, individually or in the aggregate, to the conduct of the
Business by the Transferred Entities except for inventory sold in
the ordinary course of business and not in violation of this Agreement, in
each case, free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens. The
Transferred Entities are in compliance with the terms of such leases or
similar Contracts, except, in each case, as would not reasonably be expected
to be materially adverse, individually or in the aggregate, to the Transferred
Entities or the ongoing conduct of the Business by the Transferred Entities.

 



15 Section 2.11 _Intellectual Property_. Subject to completion of the
Restructuring Transactions and taking into account the right to use the Seller
Marks as provided hereby, each Transferred Entity owns or has the right to use
all Intellectual Property that is used in and material to the operation of the
Business by the Transferred Entities; _provided, however,_ that any such
right to use the Seller Software from and after the Closing shall be solely to
the extent provided by the Transition Services Agreement and to the extent
historically used by the Business during the Service Baseline Period (as
defined in the Transition Services Agreement). _Section_ __ _ 2.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter_ lists all material issued patents, patent
applications and applications and registrations for other Intellectual
Property owned by a Transferred Entity as of the date hereof or that will be
assigned to a Transferred Entity prior to the Closing, in each case excluding
the Seller Marks. Each of the items set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 2.11 of the
Seller Disclosure Letter_ and each of the material unregistered Intellectual
Property owned by a Transferred Entity necessary for the conduct of the
Business by the Transferred Entities (collectively, the " _Owned Intellectual
Property_ ") are owned free and clear of all Liens except for Permitted Liens.
Other than the Seller Marks and the Seller Software, none of the Selling
Entities or any Subsidiary of the Selling Entities (other than the
Transferred Entities) owns, licenses or sublicenses to any Transferred Entity
any Intellectual Property that is used in and material, individually or in the
aggregate, to the conduct of the Business by the Transferred Entities. To the
Knowledge of Seller, each of the items set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.11 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter_ is valid and enforceable and there are no
oppositions, cancellations, invalidity proceedings, interferences or re-
examination proceedings presently pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller,
threatened, with respect to the Owned Intellectual Property that would
adversely affect the Business in any material respect. Each Transferred
Entity has used reasonable efforts to protect the confidentiality of all
material trade secrets (if any) used in the conduct of the Business by the
Transferred Entities. In the twenty-four (24) months prior to the date of
this Agreement: (a) no Transferred Entity has received any notice or claim
that it is infringing on or has misappropriated or otherwise violated the
Intellectual Property rights of any Person or challenging the use, ownership,
validity or enforceability of any Owned Intellectual Property; and (b) to the
Knowledge of Seller, there is no infringement or misappropriation material to
the Business by any Person of the Owned Intellectual Property. To the
Knowledge of Seller, the current and former products, services and conduct of
the Business do not infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate any
Intellectual Property rights of any Person. _Section_ __ _ 2.11 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_ sets forth a complete and correct list, as of the date
hereof, of: (i) all written licenses to which a Transferred Entity is a party,
pursuant to which a Transferred Entity permits any Person to use any of the
Owned Intellectual Property; and (ii) all written licenses (or, with respect
to Software, a listing of such Software) to which a Transferred Entity is a
party, pursuant to which any Person permits a Transferred Entity to use any
Intellectual Property (other than any Seller Software and Commercial
Software, and with respect to other Software, such Section of the Seller
Disclosure Letter lists only such other Software that, to the Knowledge of
Seller, consists of business application Software used exclusively
or primarily in the operation of the Business or for which the annual
aggregate amount payable by the Transferred Entities is greater than
$500,000), excluding in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) any written licenses
which are not material to the Business and for which the annual aggregate
amount payable to or by the Transferred Entities pursuant to such agreement is
less than $100,000 and any written licenses that are only between or among the
Transferred Entities (the " _IP License Agreements_ "). Assuming receipt of
all required consents, approvals and

 



16  authorizations with respect to Contracts relating to Software and except for
the Seller Software: (i) neither the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby nor the execution, delivery or performance of this
Agreement will result in the loss or impairment of or give rise to any right
of termination or other right to impair or limit, or otherwise result in the
breach of, any Transferred Entitys rights to own or use any Owned
Intellectual Property or to use any Intellectual Property licensed to the
Business that is used in the conduct of the Business by the Transferred
Entities; and (ii) immediately subsequent to the Closing, all such Owned
Intellectual Property and such Intellectual Property licensed to the Business
will be owned or available for use by the Transferred Entities on the same or
substantially similar terms and conditions to those under which the
Transferred Entities owned or used such Owned Intellectual Property or such
Intellectual Property licensed to the Business immediately prior to the
Closing without payment of any additional fees (other than fees to which the
applicable Transferred Entity was otherwise subject). For the avoidance of
doubt, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Buyers and their
Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) shall have no right, title or
interest in or to (including any license rights or rights to use) any
Seller Software made available to them pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement except to the extent otherwise expressly provided in the Transition
Services Agreement and to the extent historically used by the Business during
the Service Baseline Period (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement). This _Section_ __ _ 2.11_, together with _Section_ __ _ 2.9_,
contains the sole and exclusive representations made by Seller relating to
intellectual property matters.

Section 2.12 _Litigation_. As of the date hereof: (a) there is no
Litigation pending or threatened in writing against a Transferred Entity or
its assets or properties (or a Selling Entity or any its Affiliates or any
officer, director, employee, contractor or representative of a Transferred
Entity or Selling Entity or any of its Affiliates, in each case concerning
the Business), except as would not reasonably be expected to be materially
adverse, individually or in the aggregate, to the Transferred Entities or to
the ongoing conduct of the Business by the Transferred Entities; and (b)
there are no outstanding orders, writs, injunctions, rulings, awards or
decrees (collectively, " _Orders_ ") issued against or in respect of a
Transferred Entity or its assets or properties (or a Selling Entity or any of
its Affiliates or any officer, director, employee or representative of a
Transferred Entity or Selling Entity, in each case concerning the Business).

 

Section 2.13 _Compliance with Laws; Licenses and Permits_.

 

(a) Each of the Transferred Entities is in compliance in all material
respects with all Laws applicable to such Transferred Entity or the Business.

(b) Each of the Transferred Entities holds all licenses, franchises,
permits, certificates, consents, approvals or other similar authorizations
(the " _Permits_ ") necessary for the operation of its Business, except as
would not reasonably be expected to be materially adverse, individually or in
the aggregate, to the Transferred Entities or the ongoing conduct of the
Business by the Transferred Entities. The Permits are valid and in full force
and effect, no Transferred Entity is in default under the Permits, and no
suspension, revocation, cancellation or modification of any Permit is pending
or, to the Knowledge of Seller, has been threatened in writing and none of the
Permits will be terminated or adversely and materially affected as a result of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of the Transferred Entities is in
compliance,

 



17  in all material respects, with the terms and conditions of all Permits owned
or possessed by any of them.

 

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, since January 1,
2013, none of Seller or its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities)
or any employee, officer, director, or, to the extent that it would constitute
a breach of applicable Law, any agent or representative of Seller or its
Affiliates (including any Transferred Entity) has, in connection with or
acting on behalf of the Business and/or a Transferred Entity: (i) made or
offered any unlawful payment, or offered or promised to make any unlawful
payment, or provided or offered or promised to provide anything of

Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd 1, et seq., the UK
Bribery Act 2010 and any Law implementing the OECD Convention on
Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in International Business

2013, neither Seller or its Affiliates (other than any Transferred Entity) (in

payment or vesting, increase or require the funding of any amount of
compensation or benefits due to, or result in forgiveness of any debt of, in
each case, any Business Employee or other individual service provider of the
Transferred Entities. No amount that could be received (whether in cash or
property or the vesting of the property) as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by any employee, director or
other service provider of any Transferred Entity under any Benefit Plan or
otherwise would not be deductible by reason of Section 280G of the Code or

All material Taxes required to be withheld by the Transferred Entities have
been duly and timely withheld, and such withheld Taxes have been either duly
and timely paid to the proper Governmental Authority or properly set aside in
accounts for such purpose.

(b) _Financial Records_. All accounting entries (including charges and
accruals) for Taxes with respect to the Transferred Entities reflected on the
books and records of the Transferred Entities (excluding any provision for
deferred income taxes reflecting either differences between the treatment of

to cover any material Tax liabilities accruing through the end of the last
period for which the Transferred Entities ordinarily record items on their
respective books and records maintained in the ordinary course of business.

(c) _Procedure and Compliance_. As of the date hereof: (i) no written
agreement waiving or extending, or having the effect of waiving or extending,

(i) promptly notify Buyers in writing, which notification shall include the
nature of the legal requirement and the extent of the required disclosure; and
(ii) exercise commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality
of the Confidential Information disclosed, including by cooperating with
Buyers to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information
required to be disclosed.

 

(d) Buyers acknowledge and agree that Seller and its respective Affiliates
shall have the right to retain copies of all books, data, files, information
and records in any media of the Transferred Entities relating to periods
ending on or prior to the Closing Date: (i) relating to information (including
employment and medical records) regarding the Transferred Employees; (ii) as
may be required by any Governmental Authority, including pursuant to any
applicable Law or regulatory request; or (iii) as may be necessary for Seller
or its Affiliates to perform their respective obligations pursuant to this
Agreement or any of the Ancillary Agreements, in each case subject to
compliance with all applicable privacy Laws.

 



33 (e) After the Closing Date, Buyers shall, and shall cause the
Transferred Entities to, until the later of the seventh (7th) anniversary of
the Closing Date and the end of any retention period required by applicable
Law: (i) retain all material books, records and other documents pertaining to
the Business in existence on the Closing Date and make the same available for
inspection and copying by Seller (at Sellers expense) during normal business
hours and in a manner so as to not interfere with the normal business
operations of the Transferred Entities to the extent that such inspection and
copying is reasonably necessary for Seller with respect to its defense of any
Third-Party Claims for which Buyers are entitled to indemnification
hereunder or in order to comply with any tax reporting obligation of Seller
or its Affiliates under applicable Law or for other valid business reasons;
and (ii) cause the employees, counsel and financial advisors of Buyers and
their respective Affiliates to reasonably cooperate with Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with their ongoing financial reporting, accounting or
other purposes (including complying with Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall
Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act) related to Sellers ownership of
the Business (including the provision of relevant parts of the books and
records of any of the Transferred Entities), during normal business hours,
upon reasonable request and upon reasonable notice;  _provided_ , that in
each case, Buyers and the Transferred Entities will not be required to provide
access to any books, records and other documents if: (x) doing so could
violate any Contract or Law to which any Buyer or any of the Transferred
Entities are party or subject; or (y) Buyers or any of the Transferred
Entities believe in good faith based on advice of counsel that doing so could
result in a loss of the ability to successfully assert a claim of
privilege (including the attorney-client and work product privileges);
_provided_ , _further_ that, except as provided pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.2(c)_, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, keep confidential,
and not disclose or use, except as otherwise expressly permitted herein, any
such books, records and other documents. Buyers shall, and shall cause the
Transferred Entities to, use commercially reasonable efforts to notify Seller
prior to the destruction of any material books, records or documents by any
Buyer or any of the Transferred Entities and give Seller a reasonable
opportunity to obtain possession thereof after the seventh (7th) anniversary
of the Closing Date.

 

(f) For a period of one (1) year after the Closing Date (or, if longer, for
the time periods, if any, for which pro forma financial information relating
to the Business is required to be disclosed pursuant to Regulation S-X under
the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended), each Buyer and Seller
shall, and shall cause each of its respective Affiliates to, and shall
request each of its respective independent auditors to, cooperate with the
other party in providing information relating to the Business or any of the
Transferred Entities for the purpose of preparing any financial statements or
other financial reports that are required to be filed by such party or its
Affiliates with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The requesting
party shall reimburse the other party for its reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses incurred in performing the covenants contained in this _Section_ __ _
4.2(f)_.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 4.2_,
Seller shall have no obligation to provide Buyers or their respective
representatives access to the properties or assets of the Transferred Entities
to conduct any subsurface or Phase II environmental investigation or sampling
or testing of any environmental medium and no such investigation or sampling
or testing shall be undertaken by or on behalf of Buyers before the Closing
Date without Sellers prior written consent.

 



34 Section 4.3 _Governmental Approvals; Third-Party Consents_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, from the date
hereof until the Closing or the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, each Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things reasonably necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the satisfaction, but not waiver, of the conditions
precedent set forth in _ARTICLE 6_ ). Each Buyer and Seller shall use
reasonable best efforts to promptly obtain consents of all Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Each party hereto shall ensure that filings pursuant to the HSR Act
and all other filings required by applicable Competition Laws with respect to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are submitted promptly (and in
any event, within ten (10) Business Days for a filing pursuant to the HSR Act
and within twenty (20) Business Days for all other filings, if any, required
by applicable Competition Laws) after the date of this Agreement and shall
resubmit any such filings as soon as is reasonably practicable in the event
such filings are rejected for any reason whatsoever by the relevant
Governmental Authority. Each party shall supply as promptly as practicable to
the appropriate Governmental Authorities any additional information and
documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act or other
Competition Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_
__ _ 4.3_, Buyers agree to use their best efforts to take promptly and/or to
permit all actions that are necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every
impediment under any Competition Laws that may be asserted by any relevant
Governmental Authority or any other Person with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement so as to enable the Closing to occur
expeditiously, but in no case later than the End Date, including, but not
limited to: (i) selling, licensing or otherwise disposing of, or holding
separate and agreeing to sell, license or otherwise dispose of, any
entities, assets, businesses or facilities of any of the Transferred Entities
or any entity, asset, business or facility of any Buyer or its Affiliates;
(ii) terminating, amending or assigning existing relationships and contractual
rights and obligations (other than terminations that would result in a breach
of a contractual obligation to a third party); and (iii) amending, assigning
or terminating existing licenses or other agreements (other than terminations
that would result in a breach of a license or such other agreement with a
third party) and entering into such new licenses or other agreements.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyers
shall take the lead in directing strategy, subject to reasonable consultation
with Seller, in connection with all matters relating to obtaining clearances,
approvals and the expiration of waiting periods under or in connection with
the HSR Act or any other applicable Competition Law, and Buyers shall take
the lead in all meetings or discussions with any Governmental Authority in
connection therewith. Seller shall not discuss, negotiate or commit to any
divestiture transaction, or discuss or commit to alter its businesses
or commercial practices in any way, or otherwise take or commit to take any
action that limits any Buyers freedom of action with respect to its assets,
properties or businesses or the assets, properties or businesses being
acquired pursuant to this Agreement. Buyers, on the one hand, and Seller, on
the other hand, will promptly notify the other of any oral or written
communication received by either Buyers and/or Seller, as the case may be,
from any Governmental Authority regarding any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and Seller shall allow Buyers to review in advance any
proposed written communication to any such Governmental Authority and
incorporate all of Buyers reasonable comments. 

 



35  Neither party shall participate in any substantive meeting or discussion
with any such Governmental Authority in respect of any filing, investigation
or inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
unless, to the extent reasonably practicable, it consults with the other party
hereto in advance and, to the extent permitted by such Governmental Authority,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and furnish the other party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and written communications between
them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on one hand and
any such Governmental Authority or its respective staff on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Buyers shall use their best efforts to avoid the entry of, or to
effect the dissolution of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding, which would
otherwise have the effect of materially delaying or preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or that would make the
consummation of the acquisition of the Transferred Entities in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement unlawful. Buyers shall take the lead in defending
against any Litigation brought or threatened by any Governmental Authority or
any other Person which challenges or questions the legality or validity of the
transactions contemplated hereby or seeks damages in connection therewith. The
parties hereto agree to reasonably cooperate and use best efforts to defend
against such Litigation and, if an Order is issued in any such Litigation, to
use reasonable best efforts to have such an Order lifted, and to reasonably
cooperate regarding any other impediment to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) Each party to this Agreement agrees to reasonably cooperate in
obtaining any other consents and approvals that may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein shall obligate or
be construed to obligate Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to make, or to
cause to be made, any payment to any third party in order to obtain the
consent or approval of such third party under any Material Contract and
neither Seller nor any of the Transferred Entities shall offer or grant any
accommodation or amendment or modification in connection with obtaining such
consent or approval, except with the prior written consent of Buyers.

 

(e) With respect to Multi-party Contracts all of which are listed in
_Section_ __ _ 4.3 of the Seller Disclosure Letter_, Seller shall use all
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain prior to the Closing or, if not
obtained, will use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain within six
(6) months following the Closing Date, from the counterparty to each Multi-
party Contract any needed consent to separate the portion of such contract
that relates to the goods or services purchased from or supplied to the
Business under such Multi-party Contract (a " _Multi-party Contract Consent_
"), it being agreed that Seller shall not be required to provide any
consideration to any counterparty to such a Multi-party Contract in order to
obtain such Multi-party Contract Consent. The contract constituting the
separated portion of any Multi-party Contract that relates to the Business as
described in the preceding sentence shall be assumed by and become the
responsibility of the applicable Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, with respect to any Multi-party Contract for which Seller is unable
to obtain a Multi-party Contract Consent, in each case for the remainder of
the term under such Multi-party Contract: (i) Seller shall, or shall cause any
applicable Affiliate to, purchase from the applicable Buyer such goods or
services to be purchased from the Business by the third party under such
Multi-party Contract pursuant to

 



36  the same terms provided for in such Multi-party Contract, and Seller shall
supply such goods or services to such third party pursuant to the same terms
provided for in such Multi-party Contract; and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates
shall obtain such goods or services supplied to the Business by the third
party under such Multi-party Contract and Seller and its Affiliates shall
supply the same to the applicable Buyer or to any Transferred Entity as such
Buyer may direct pursuant to the same terms provided for in such Multi-party
Contract.

(f) Prior to the Closing, Seller will assign all Seller Contracts to the
applicable Transferred Entity, and cause such Transferred Entity to assume the
obligations thereunder, on or prior to the Closing Date, _provided_ , with
respect to those Seller Contracts listed in _Section_ __ _ 4.3 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Listed Seller Contracts_ "), if such Listed Seller
Contract may only be assigned with the consent of the counterparty thereto,
then Seller will only be required to so assign such Listed Seller Contract
if, after the use of commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Closing
Date, Seller has obtained such consent to assignment (it being understood that
the Listed Seller Contracts includes all Contracts described in subsections
(i), (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Seller Contracts and all Contracts
described in subsection (iv) of the definition of Seller Contracts that are
material to the Business of the Transferred Entities). If any such consent to
assignment is not obtained prior to the Closing Date, then Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such consent within six (6) months
following the Closing Date and, if so obtained, Seller shall thereupon assign
such Listed Seller Contract to the applicable Buyer or an Affiliate of such
Buyer so designated by such Buyer, and such Buyer or such Affiliate of Buyer
will assume the obligations thereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, nothing herein shall obligate or be construed to
obligate Seller or any Affiliate of Seller to make, or to cause to be made,
any payment to any third party in order to obtain the consent or approval
of such third party under any Seller Contract. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, with respect to any Listed Seller Contract (other than any Contracts
relating to Software from third parties) for which Seller is unable to obtain
any necessary consent to assignment, in each case for the remainder of the
term under such Listed Seller Contract: (i) Seller shall, or shall cause any
applicable Affiliate to, purchase from the applicable Buyer such goods or
services to be purchased from the Business by the third party under such
Listed Seller Contract pursuant to the same terms provided for in such Listed
Seller Contract, and Seller shall supply such goods or services to such third
party pursuant to the same terms provided for in such Listed Seller Contract;
and (ii) Seller and its Affiliates shall obtain such goods or services
supplied to the Business by the third party under such Listed Seller Contract
and Seller and its Affiliates shall supply the same to the applicable Buyer
or to any Transferred Entity as such Buyer may direct pursuant to the same
terms provided for in such Listed Seller Contract. For the avoidance of doubt,
Seller will assign all Seller Contracts, not just Listed Seller Contracts,
to the applicable Buyer (subject to the proviso in the second sentence of
this _Section_ __ _ 4.3(f)_); however, nothing herein shall obligate Seller
to obtain consent in respect of the assignment of any Seller Contract that is
not a Listed Seller Contract. At any time prior to Closing, Seller shall have
the right to add (upon delivery of written notice to Buyers including the
revised schedule, and in each case subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.15_)
additional Seller Contracts to _Section_ __ _ 4.3 of the Seller Disclosure
Letter_ _,_ without the consent of Buyers except in the case where the
assignment to a Transferred Entity of any such additional Seller Contract
would constitute the entry into a Material Contract in violation of _Section_
__ _ 4.1(h)_.

 



37 Section 4.4 _Employees and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) From and after the date hereof until the Closing Date, Buyers shall
consult with Seller and obtain Sellers consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) before distributing any
communications to any Business Employee, whether relating to employee
benefits, post-Closing terms of employment or otherwise. Buyers shall provide
Seller with advance copies of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment on, all
such communications. At the request of Buyers, Seller shall cooperate with
Buyers and use commercially reasonable efforts to make available for
discussion at reasonable times for purposes of preparing for the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby members of Sellers transition team
established in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, prior to the Closing Date,
Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall use its best efforts to transfer
from Seller or one of its Affiliates, as applicable, to a Transferred Entity
each Business Employee who is not employed by a Transferred Entity as of the
date of this Agreement. Seller shall provide at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date a list of each such Business Employee. Seller shall
comply with all applicable Laws in effectuating such transfer, including
obtaining any consent from such employees to the extent required
by applicable Law, and complying with any notice and consultation or consent
obligations as required of any collective bargaining agreement, collective
agreement, works council or other similar agreements with a union, trade
union, council of trade unions, employee bargaining agency, affiliated
bargaining agent or other labor organizations. Seller shall in no event be
liable to Buyers for any transfer which cannot be effected due to a Business
Employee objecting to such proposed transfer, but Seller shall remain
responsible for any liabilities, including severance, owing to or in respect
of any such objecting Business Employee as provided in _Sections_ __ _
4.4(f)_ and _4.4(n)(ii)_ below.

 

(c) In the event the employment of any Business Employee will not
automatically transfer to the applicable Buyer or its Affiliates upon the
occurrence of the Closing pursuant to the transfer of the Shares as a result
of the Transferred Entities becoming Affiliates of such Buyer (each, an "
_Offer Employee_ "), not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing, such Buyer will or will cause one of its Affiliates to offer
employment, effective at 12:01 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date (the "
_Transfer Time_ "), to such Business Employee in accordance with
this Agreement, subject to Seller providing such Buyer with information
necessary to make such offers of employment. Offers pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 4.4(c)_ shall: (i) be for a comparable position at the same or a
nearby geographic work location, in each case, to those as of the Closing
Date; (ii) be sufficient to avoid statutory or common Law severance
obligations (but other than those severance obligations that are payable
regardless of the terms of the offer) or severance obligations under the
arrangements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.4(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter_; and (iii) otherwise comply in all respects with applicable Law
(including with respect to compensation and benefits). With respect to any
Offer Employee who, as of the Closing Date, is on approved leave of absence
from work with Seller or its Affiliates (each, an " _Inactive Employee_ "),
the applicable Buyer shall offer employment to such individual on the
earliest practicable date following the return of such individual to work with
Seller and its Affiliates and otherwise on terms and conditions consistent
with this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_; _provided_ that such employee returns to work
within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days following the Closing Date or
such later time as required by applicable Law or the terms of any applicable

 



38  Labor Contract upon presenting themselves for duty to the Business. No later
than ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, Seller shall provide Buyers a list of all Inactive Employees
and the projected end date of each such leave of absence. Following the
Closing and while any applicable Buyer has obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(c)_, Seller shall promptly notify such Buyer of the
occurrence of the end of any such leave of absence. In the case of any
Inactive Employee who becomes a Transferred Employee on a date following the
Closing Date, all references in this Agreement to: (1) the day following the
Closing Date shall be deemed to be references to the date on which such
individual becomes a Transferred Employee; and (2) the Transfer Time shall be
deemed to be references to 12:01 a.m., local time, on the date that
such individual becomes a Transferred Employee. For the avoidance of doubt,
the twelve (12)-month period immediately following the Closing Date referred
to in _Section_ __ _ 4.4(g)_ shall not be extended by operation of
the preceding sentence, except as may be required by applicable Law.

(d) As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement, but in no
event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the date of this Agreement,
Seller shall provide Buyers with a true and complete list containing each
individual identified by Seller as expected to be an Offer Employee (and such
list shall include the then-current employing entity, identification number,
position, union affiliation, date of hire, start date of services, work
location, wage rate, current base compensation, cash and equity bonus
opportunity for the current year, actual cash and equity grants in the prior
year, as applicable, of each identified individual to the extent different
from the information provided for such identified individual in the Employee
List provided by Seller to Buyers pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.15(a)_), and
Seller shall update such information periodically prior to the Closing Date to
reflect new hires, leaves of absence and employment terminations and provide
copies of such updated lists to Buyers (which updated lists shall contain an
identification number, employing entity, date of hire, start date of services,
title or position, union affiliation, work location, wage rate, current base
compensation, cash and equity bonus opportunity for the current year, actual
cash and equity grants in the prior year, as applicable, for each individual
identified as a new hire or on a leave of absence and expected to be an Offer
Employee).

 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, prior to the Closing Date,
Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall transfer from any Transferred
Entity to Seller or one of its Affiliates (other than a Transferred Entity)
all employees who are not primarily dedicated to the operation of the
Business (" _Non-Transferred Entity Employee_"). Seller shall comply with all
applicable Laws in effectuating such transfer, including obtaining any consent
from those employees to the extent required by applicable Law, and complying
with any notice and consultation or consent obligations as required of any
collective bargaining agreement, collective agreement, works council or other
similar agreements with a union, trade union, council of trade unions,
employee bargaining agency, affiliated bargaining agent or other labor
organization representing such employees. In the event the employment of any
Non-Transferred Entity Employee does not transfer to Seller or its Affiliates
prior to the Closing, Seller will or will cause one of its Affiliates (other
than a Transferred Entity) prior to the Closing Date to offer employment,
effective at 12:01 a.m., local time, on the Closing Date, to such Non-
Transferred Entity Employee on the same terms of employment then in effect.

 



39 (f) Seller and Buyers intend that, except as required by applicable
Law, the transactions contemplated hereby should not constitute a separation,
termination or severance of employment of any Business Employee, other than
Refusal Employees, prior to or upon the occurrence of the Transfer Time,
including for purposes of any Benefit Plan that provides for separation,
termination or severance benefits, and that such employee will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after the
Transfer Time, and Seller and Buyers shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, comply with any requirements under applicable Law to ensure the
same. Other than as specifically set forth in this Agreement and subject to
the representations and warranties of Seller set forth herein, Buyers or
their respective Affiliates shall bear all the liabilities, obligations and
costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) from and against: (i) any
claims made by any Business Employee for any statutory or common law
severance obligations, any other related legally mandated payment obligations
(including any compensation payable during a mandatory termination notice
period and any payments pursuant to a judgment of a court having jurisdiction
over the parties hereto), and severance obligations under the arrangements set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.4(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_, and for any
other claim, cost, liability or obligation (whether related to compensation,
benefits or otherwise), in each case, arising out of or in connection with:
the failure of Buyers or their respective Affiliates to make an offer of
employment to anyone designated by Seller as an Offer Employee pursuant to
this Agreement, or to continue the employment of, any Business Employee or any
other individual who is entitled to automatically transfer to any Buyer or its
Affiliates upon the occurrence of the Closing pursuant to the transfer of the
Shares as a result of the Transferred Entities becoming Affiliates of such
Buyer, in each case, in accordance with this Agreement or applicable Law; and
(ii) any claims relating to the employment of any Transferred Employee after
the Transfer Time in respect of any act or omission relating to the
employment of any Transferred Employee after the Transfer Time. Seller or its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) shall bear all the
liabilities, obligations and costs relating to, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyers and their respective Affiliates from and against any claims
made by any Refusal Employee or Non-Transferred Entity Employee for any
statutory or common law severance obligations, any other related legally
mandated payment obligations (including any compensation payable during a
mandatory termination notice period and any payments pursuant to a judgment of
a court having jurisdiction over the parties hereto), and severance
obligations under the arrangement set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.4(c) of
Seller Disclosure Letter_, and for any other claim, cost, liability or
obligation (whether related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each
case, arising out of or in connection with the Refusal Employees refusal to
accept an offer of employment from (or to commence employment with), or
objection to the automatic transfer of employment to, the applicable Buyer or
its Affiliates, or a Non-Transferred Entity Employee refusing to transfer or
not accepting an offer of employment from Seller or an Affiliate of Seller
(other than a Transferred Entity) or the termination of any such Non-
Transferred Entity Employee by such Buyer after the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, Buyers and their respective Affiliates shall be
responsible for all benefits under the MW CIC Plan through June 30, 2017 with
respect to any Transferred Employees that are covered by such plan.

 

(g) With respect to each Transferred Employee, for the twelve (12)-month
period immediately following the Closing Date (except as otherwise provided
below) or such longer period required by applicable Law (such period, the "
_Benefits Continuation Period_ "),

 



40  Buyers and their respective Affiliates shall (or shall cause any other
Person providing compensation and benefits on their behalf to) provide to each
such Transferred Employee: (i) no less favorable base salary or wage rates,
as applicable, than the base salary or wage rates, as applicable, provided by
Seller and its Affiliates (or any other Person providing compensation and
benefits on their behalf) immediately prior to the Closing; (ii) cash
incentive compensation opportunities that when considered together with the
base salary or wage rates, as applicable, provided under clause (i) provide
such Transferred Employee with compensation that is substantially
comparable in the aggregate to the base salary or wage rates, as applicable,
and cash incentive compensation opportunities provided by Seller and its
Affiliates (or any other Person providing compensation and benefits on their
behalf) immediately prior to the Closing, but excluding the impact of any
equity-based or phantom equity award; (iii) at the applicable Buyers sole
discretion, and subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreements and
the terms of  _Section_ __ _ 4.4(j)_ below, either employee benefits under
plans, programs and arrangements that will provide benefits to such U.S.
Transferred Employees that are substantially similar to the employee benefits
of similarly situated employees of such Buyer and its Affiliates (other than
the Transferred Entities), or substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
employee benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates (or any other Person
providing compensation or benefits on their behalf) immediately prior to the
Closing, excluding equity or phantom equity plans and programs, change in
control severance benefits, defined benefit pension plans (other than as
required by applicable law or a collective bargaining agreement), and retiree
medical and retiree life insurance plans; (iv) employee benefits under plans,
programs and arrangements that will provide benefits to such non-U.S.
Transferred Employee that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
the employee benefits provided by Seller and its Affiliates (or any other
Person providing compensation or benefits on their behalf) immediately prior
to the Closing, excluding equity or phantom equity plans and programs, change
in control severance benefits, defined benefit pension plans (other than as
required by applicable law or a collective bargaining agreement), and retiree
medical and retiree life insurance plans; and (v) for the period through June
30, 2017, an office within a commute of no more than forty (40) miles from his
or her office as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, in each case
subject to applicable Law; _provided_ that if a relocation beyond that
distance is required and such employees employment terminates as a result of
his desire not to accept such a relocation, such employee shall receive from
the applicable Buyer the severance benefits at the level set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(j)_; _provided_ _further_ that, in the case of clauses (i)
through (iv), such Buyer shall, or shall cause an Affiliate to, use reasonably
commercial efforts to comply with any additional customary and reasonable
requirements in order to avoid a claim of separation, termination or severance
of employment under applicable Law or any Labor Contract. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed
as requiring any Buyer or any of its Affiliates to continue the employment of
any Transferred Employee for any period after the Closing Date.

 

(h) As of immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall assume and honor,
or cause its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Entities) to assume and
honor, all obligations with respect to the bonus amounts payable under the
2016 WestRock Short-Term Incentive Plan to Business Employees who will become
Transferred Employees as of the Closing (the " _Short-Term Incentive Amounts_
"). The Short-Term Incentive Amounts shall be calculated for each Business
Employee who shall become a Transferred Employee as of the Closing by
multiplying the target bonus for the performance period for such individual
by the total number of days from the beginning of the performance period
through the Closing Date, divided by 365. All Short-

 



41  Term Incentive Amounts shall be paid immediately prior to the Closing by
Seller or its Affiliates (excluding the Transferred Entities) to such Business
Employees who shall become Transferred Employees upon the Closing. As of the
Closing, the applicable Buyer shall assume and honor or cause its Affiliates
to assume and honor, in accordance with their terms, all obligations with
respect to the bonus amounts payable to Transferred Employees under each
incentive plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates as described in
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ with respect to the
performance period in which the Closing occurs, _provided_  that, with
respect to the portion of any such bonus amounts related to periods on or
prior to the Closing Date, solely to the extent taken into account as a
current liability included in the calculation of the Final Closing True-Up
Amount (the " _Assumed Payments_ "). Such Assumed Payments shall be determined
in accordance with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 4.4(h) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_,  _provided_ that the employer portion of any employment
Tax related to the portion of the Assumed Payments that relate to periods on
or prior to the Closing Date shall also be taken into account as a current
liability included in the calculation of the Final Closing True-Up Amount.
Buyers and Seller agree that for Tax purposes: (i) Assumed Payments that are
taken into account as a current liability included in the calculation of the
Final Closing True-Up Amount, and the employer portion of any employment Tax
related to such Assumed Payments, shall be deemed to be paid by Buyers acting
on behalf of Seller; (ii) Seller rather than any Buyer shall be the party
that will take a Tax deduction in respect of such amounts; and (iii) such
amounts do not represent an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price for Tax
purposes. Following the date hereof and until the Closing, Seller shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, pay in the ordinary course and consistent with
past practices all Business Employees bonuses, incentives, commissions and
other similar payments when due.

 

(i) In connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and effective
as of the Closing, each equity award relating to WestRock common stock
granted to a Transferred Employee in 2016 shall, to the extent such award is
not vested in accordance with its terms, become vested (with respect to the
service-based vesting requirements under such award) on a  _pro_ - _rata_
basis determined by multiplying the number of unvested shares subject to such
award by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of full completed
months between January 1, 2016 and the Closing Date, and the denominator of
which is 36, _provided_ that such awards shall remain subject to the
satisfaction of the performance goals stated therein.

 

(j) With respect to each Transferred Employee who is covered by the MW CIC
Plan and terminated on or before June 30, 2017 (other than for cause, as
reasonably determined by the applicable Buyer or any of its Affiliates), the
applicable Buyer or its Affiliates shall provide severance or termination
benefits to each such Transferred Employee that are no less favorable than
those severance or termination benefits applicable to each such Transferred
Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(j) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_.

 

(k) With respect to each Transferred Employee, effective from and after the
Transfer Time, the applicable Buyer and its Affiliates shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to: (i) recognize, for all purposes (other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or scheme, and other than any
retiree medical or retiree life insurance plan) under all plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by the applicable Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of such Transferred Employees, service with Seller
and its Affiliates prior to the 

 



42  Closing to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding
Benefit Plan covering such Transferred Employee, including for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals (other than benefit
accrual under a defined benefit pension plan or scheme, and other than any
retiree medical or retiree life insurance plans), in each case, except where
it would result in a duplication of benefits; (ii) use commercially
reasonably efforts to waive any pre-existing condition exclusion, actively-at-
work requirement or waiting period under all employee health and other
welfare benefit plans established or maintained by the applicable Buyer or its
Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred Employees, except to the extent
such pre-existing condition, exclusion, requirement or waiting period would
have applied to such individual under the corresponding Benefit Plan; and
(iii) use commercially reasonably efforts to provide full credit for any co-
payments, deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the
Closing for the plan year in which the Closing occurs. To the extent any
Transferred Employee receives compensation or benefits from another Person on
behalf of the applicable Buyer and its Affiliates, the applicable Buyer and
its Affiliates will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Person
to comply with the requirements of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.4(k)_ as if such
compensation or benefits were provided pursuant to plans, programs or
arrangements established or maintained by the applicable Buyer and its
Affiliates.

 

(l) For the Benefits Continuation Period, the applicable Buyer shall assume
and honor, in accordance with the terms of the applicable policy (or other
applicable arrangement) of Seller or its applicable Affiliate, all vacation
days and other paid time off to which the Transferred Employees are entitled
under the applicable policy (or any such other arrangement) in or prior to
the applicable period in which the Closing Date occurs and, with respect to
hourly employees, that are included as a current liability in the calculation
of the Final Closing True-Up Amount, and in all cases, which have not yet
been taken by the Transferred Employees (collectively, the " _Accrued Vacation
Days_ "). To the extent that a Transferred Employee is entitled under
applicable Law to be paid for any Accrued Vacation Days in connection with
the Closing, the applicable Buyer and its Affiliates shall pay any such
required amounts to such Transferred Employee that are included as an "other
current liability" in the calculation of the Final Closing True-Up Amount.

(m) Except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement, each applicable
Buyer shall, or shall cause each of its Affiliates to, assume, honor and
fulfill all of the obligations of the Transferred Entities and Seller and its
other Affiliates, if any, under the collective bargaining agreements set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 2.15(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Labor
Contracts_ ") in accordance with and subject to their terms. Without limiting
the generality of the forgoing, each applicable Buyer shall, or shall cause
an Affiliate to, employ each Transferred Employee whose terms of employment
are covered by a Labor Contract on all of the terms and conditions of
employment of the applicable Labor Contract on the Closing Date, including
wages, benefits, severance protection (if any), provision of pension, health
and other benefit plans, vacation, leave, hours or work and other terms and
conditions of employment in effect with respect to such Transferred Employee
on the Closing Date, and honor and fulfill all applicable obligations under
the applicable Labor Contract in respect to such Transferred Employee, except
as the same may be modified consistent with applicable Law. Buyers and Seller
shall each cooperate for the purposes of providing the relevant
representative of any group covered by a Labor Contract with required notices,
bargaining with the representative, if required by the terms of the Labor
Contract or any applicable Law, and taking any other necessary actions 

 



43  in connection with negotiating any changes in the terms of employment of the
Transferred Employees covered by such Labor Contract necessary or appropriate
to effectuate the employment of such Transferred Employees on terms and
conditions consistent with this _Section_ __ _ 4.4_. Each applicable Buyer
and its Affiliates shall be exclusively responsible for any liability incurred
in connection with any change negotiated by or at the direction of or with
the prior written consent of such Buyer or its Affiliates in respect of such
Labor Contracts.

 

(n) (i) From and after the Closing Date, Buyers shall or shall cause one
of its Affiliates to assume all employment, labor, compensation, employee
welfare and employee benefits related liabilities, commitments, claims and
Losses that are current liabilities included in the calculation of the Final
Closing True-Up Amount or that relate to each: (1) Transferred Employee (or
any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that: (A) arise as a
result of an event or events that occur after the Transfer Time; (B) Buyers
or their respective Affiliates have specifically agreed to assume, fulfill,
bear, honor or be responsible for pursuant to this Agreement; or (C) transfer
to Buyers or their respective Affiliates under applicable Law (or pursuant to
the transfer of the Shares) (except for such liabilities, commitments, claims
and Losses described in the definition of Excluded HR Liabilities) and only to
the extent such liabilities are included in the Final Closing True-Up Amount;
(2) any Business Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of any such
employee) who does not become a Transferred Employee as contemplated by this
Agreement as a result of a breach by any Buyer or any of its Affiliates of
applicable Law, any Labor Contract or this Agreement that arise as a result of
such breach; or (3) Assumed Benefit Plan (such liabilities, commitments,
claims and Losses, the " _Transferred HR Liabilities_ ");

(ii) Except as specifically provided in this Agreement (including
with respect to the Transferred HR Liabilities), neither Buyers nor any of
their respective Affiliates shall assume or be obligated to pay, perform or
otherwise discharge, and Seller and its Affiliates (other than the Transferred
Entities), as the case may be, will remain liable to pay, perform and
discharge when due all employment, labor, compensation, pension, employee
welfare and employee benefits (including defined benefit pension and retiree
welfare benefits) related liabilities, commitments, claims and Losses,
including with respect to any Benefit Plan, and shall indemnify and hold
harmless Buyers and their respective Affiliates, including the Transferred
Entities, relating to: (1) each employee of Seller and its
Affiliates, including all former Business Employees (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any such employee), other than the Transferred Employees and
their dependents and beneficiaries, in each case, that arise out of an event
or events that occur at any time; (2) each Offer Employee (or any dependent
or beneficiary of any Offer Employee) that arise as a result of an event or
events that occur as of or prior to the Transfer Time; (3) Benefit Plans that
are not Assumed Benefit Plans; (4) all Controlled Group Liabilities; (5) with
respect to defined benefit pension, retiree welfare benefits and non-U.S.
termination indemnities, each Transferred Employee (or any dependent or
beneficiary of any Transferred Employee) that arise out of any event or
events that occur as of or prior to the Transfer Time; and (6) each
Transferred Employee (or any dependent or beneficiary of any Transferred
Employee) that arise out of any event or events that occur as of or prior to
the Transfer Time (such liabilities, commitments, claims and Losses, the "
_Excluded HR Liabilities_ ");

 



44 (iii) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Seller shall be permitted
to make and retain copies of any personnel files or other records relating to
the Excluded HR Liabilities. Without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _
4.2(e)_, after the Closing Date, Buyers shall, and shall cause each of their
respective Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) to, reasonably
cooperate with, and provide reasonable assistance to, Seller and its
Affiliates in connection with, or in preparation for, existing or
future actions, investigations or claims by a third party with respect to the
Excluded HR Liabilities; and

 

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller or one of its Affiliates (other
than the Transferred Entities) shall retain all assets and liabilities
relating to the WestRock Company Deferred Compensation Plan and the
MeadWestvaco Corporation Deferred Income Plan.

 

(o) No later than the Closing Date or as otherwise provided under the
Transition Services Agreement, Buyers shall establish or cause to be
established, at their own expense, all employee benefit plans for Transferred
Employees as are necessary to comply with Buyers obligations pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 4.4_, as applicable. Effective as of the Closing, each
Transferred Employee shall cease to participate in any Benefit Plan (other
than any Assumed Benefit Plan) as an active employee. Seller shall be
responsible for providing or causing the applicable Selling Entity to provide
benefits in respect of claims incurred under any Benefit Plan for Transferred
Employees and their beneficiaries and dependents prior to the Closing whether
any such claim is made before, on or after the Closing Date. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, is intended to confer upon any
Transferred Employee any right to continued employment for any period or
continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any Assumed Benefit Plan. Buyers
agrees that Buyers shall be solely responsible for satisfying the continuation
coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code for all individuals who are
"MandA qualified beneficiaries" as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation
Section 54.4980B-9.

 

(p) Effective as of the Closing Date or as otherwise provided under the
Transition Services Agreement, Buyers shall maintain or establish a qualified
defined benefit pension plan (" _Buyer s Defined Benefit Plan_") which plan
shall provide, at a minimum, the defined benefit plan benefits required to be
provided under the WestRock Company Consolidated Pension Plan (the "
_WestRock Pension Plan_ ") pursuant to the terms of the Labor Contract with
the Graphic Communications Conference of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters, Local 508-M of District Council 3 set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.15(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ (the " _Washington Courthouse
Bargaining Agreement_ "). For purposes of eligibility to participate in
Buyers Defined Benefit Plan, vesting in benefits accrued under such plan, and
for all other purposes other than for purposes of determining benefit
accruals, Buyers Defined Benefit Plan shall give credit to employees subject
to the Washington Courthouse Bargaining Agreement in a manner consistent with
how such service was counted under the WestRock Pension Plan. Buyers shall
have no responsibility for and shall not assume any liability or
obligation arising under the WestRock Pension Plan.

(q) To the extent applicable, the parties hereto acknowledge
the application of the European Council Directive of March 12, 2001
(2001/23/EC) (the " _Directive_ "), relating to

 



45  the safeguarding of employees rights in the event of transfers of
undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses and any country legislation
implementing the Directive and any other similar Law (collectively, the "
_Transfer Regulations_ "). Buyers and Seller shall take all such actions that
may be necessary or required in order to cause the Transfer Regulations to
apply to the transactions contemplated hereby, and Buyers and Seller shall
refrain from taking any action that could cause the Transfer Regulations not
to apply to such transactions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
they shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with the
Transfer Regulations to the extent applicable.

(r) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, undertake all
provision of information and documentation to, and notice to, and
consultations, discussions or negotiations with, any unions, work councils and
other employee representatives which represent Business Employees
(collectively, the " _Employee Representatives_ ") to the extent required by
applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. To the
extent required by applicable Law, Buyers and their respective Affiliates
shall cooperate with respect to the foregoing, including by providing such
information and documentation as Seller and its Affiliates or any Employee
Representative may reasonably request.

 

(s) Seller shall be liable for the provision of notice or payment in lieu
of notice and any applicable penalties under the Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act (" _WARN_ "), any similar applicable Law or any
similar provision in a collective bargaining agreement related to terminations
for which the required initial provision of notice occurs on or before the
Closing Date. Buyers shall be liable for the provision of notice or payment in
lieu of notice and any applicable penalties under WARN, any similar Applicable
Law or any similar provision in a collective bargaining agreement related to:
(i) terminations for which the required initial provision of notice occurs
after the Closing Date; and (ii) assuming that the schedule provided by Seller
pursuant to the terms of the following sentence is accurate, any terminations
by any Buyer on or after the Closing Date that trigger notice requirements
under WARN, any similar applicable Law, or any similar provision in a
collective bargaining agreement with respect to employees that were terminated
prior to the Closing Date and have not received any such notice as of the
Closing Date. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall provide Buyers a schedule
which shall, as of the Closing Date, set forth a list of each former employee
of the Business whose employment has been terminated involuntarily within the
ninety (90)-day period immediately preceding the Closing Date, together with
such former employees work location.

 

(t) Seller hereby indemnifies each Buyer, its Affiliates, including the
Transferred Entity, and agrees to hold each of them harmless from any and all
liabilities, including attorneys and consulting fees, claims and causes of
actions, that relate to the "withdrawal liability" (pursuant to Part I of
Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA) of any Multiemployer Plan in connection with
events occurring prior to the Closing or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(u) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and not in the possession of
the Transferred Entities, Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
transfer the originals of all personnel records for Transferred Employees to
each applicable Buyer or its Affiliates, it being understood and agreed that
Seller may retain copies of such records. To the extent Seller reasonably
determines is permitted by applicable Law and could not otherwise result in
material

 



46  liability to, or otherwise negatively impact, Seller or any of its
Affiliates, following the Closing Date, Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide in a timely manner to Buyers such information
and documents relating to the Benefit Plans, employee policies, payroll data,
service crediting data, performance data and other employment-related
information as may reasonably be requested by any Buyer to facilitate the
transition of Transferred Employees to new or existing employee benefit plans
or programs of such Buyer or its Affiliates.

 

(v) Effective as of the Closing (or such later date as may be applicable to
an Offer Employee), Seller shall have assigned to each applicable Buyer or a
Transferred Entity all of rights and interests of Seller in any
confidentiality, non-solicitation of clients, non-solicitation of employees
or consultants, noninterference, non-competition or non-disparagement
agreement between Seller, on the one hand, and each Transferred Employee,
former employee, contractor and former consultant of the Business, on the
other hand, to the extent such rights and interests protect the interest of
the Business and to the extent such assignment is permitted under applicable
Law and under the terms of such agreement.

(w) With respect to each Transferred Employee who is on, or has accepted,
an international assignment or transfer as of the Closing Date, each
applicable Buyer and its Affiliates shall establish and maintain an
international assignment or transfer policy that provides substantially the
same benefits as provided to such Transferred Employee under the applicable
international assignment or transfer policy of Seller set forth in _Section_
__ _ 4.4(w) of Seller Disclosure Letter_. At least three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyers an updated version of
the International Transferee List, with information that is current as of ten
(10) or fewer Business Days prior to the Closing Date, showing each Business
Employee who is on, has accepted or will have accepted, an international
assignment or transfer as of the Closing Date, identifying the name of any
such Business Employee, the country of such Business Employees international
assignment or transfer and the benefits under any international assignment
and transfer policies of Seller being provided to such Business Employee.

(x) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to any
Business Employee are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other Person, including any
Business Employee (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the foregoing).
Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing benefits to
any employee of any Transferred Entity, any Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates.

 

Section 4.5 _Public Announcements_. Neither Buyers nor Seller shall make,
or permit any of their Affiliates or representatives to make, any public
announcement in respect of this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby without the prior written consent
of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), except as may be required: (a) to obtain consents and
approvals, and to provide such notices and make such filings, necessary to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) by Law, rule
or regulation applicable to any Buyer or Seller or any of their respective
Affiliates (and only to the extent so required); or (c) in the case of Seller,
pursuant to internal announcements to employees, _provided_ , in the case of
this clause (c) that any such disclosure is generally consistent with the
parties prior public disclosures regarding the transactions contemplated
hereby, and, to the extent practicable, is 

 



47  made after such prior notice to Buyers. It is understood that the foregoing
shall not restrict WestRock or Silgan from making such disclosure as WestRock
or Silgan deems appropriate in its reasonable judgment in light of its status
as the issuer of publicly traded securities, including to securities analysts
and institutional investors and related public disclosures, or pursuant to its
reporting obligations under applicable securities Laws or stock exchange
regulations.

Section 4.6 _D andO Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date until six (6) years from the Closing
Date, Buyers shall, and shall cause each of the Transferred Entities to,
indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under Law
and the applicable Organizational Documents of such Transferred Entity
(subject to applicable Law), in each case, as in effect immediately prior to
the Closing, the individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were
directors, officers or managers of any Transferred Entity with respect to all
acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken at the request
of any Transferred Entity at any time on or prior to the Closing Date. In
addition, from and after the Closing Date until six (6) years from the Closing
Date, Buyers shall or shall cause the Transferred Entities to reimburse any
expenses of any directors, officers or managers entitled to indemnification
hereunder as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under Law and applicable
Organizational Documents of such Transferred Entity (subject to applicable
Law), in each case, as in effect immediately prior to the Closing, _provided_
that the person to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay
such advances to the extent required by such Organizational Documents.

 

(b) The provisions relating to indemnification, exculpation, reimbursement
and advancement of expenses as set forth in the Organizational Documents of
the Transferred Entities shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at or at any time
prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers, managers, agents or
employees of any Transferred Entity or otherwise entitled to indemnification
pursuant to any Transferred Entitys Organizational Documents.

 

(c) Buyers shall, or shall cause the Companies to, obtain with effect from
the Closing Date and shall, or shall cause the Companies to, maintain in
effect for six (6) years after the Closing Date a "run-off" or "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance policy to the current policy in
respect of the Companies and their respective Subsidiaries with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Closing and having coverage limits in the same
aggregate amount as provided in the current policy for such six (6)-year
period and terms and conditions substantially similar to the terms and
conditions of the current policy for the Transferred Entities; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyers shall not be obligated to pay more than 150%, in the
aggregate, of the annual premium costs of such policies of the Transferred
Entities in effect as of the date hereof.

(d) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.6_ are intended to be for
the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each director, officer and
manager entitled to indemnification under this Section, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and are in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person
may have by contract or otherwise.

 



48 Section 4.7 _Conduct of Incidents Subject to Parent Insurances_.

(a) Buyers acknowledge that coverage for the Business under the insurance
policies of Seller and its Affiliates (the " _Parent Insurances_ ") will cease
as of the Closing Date, and that neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates will
purchase any "tail" policy or other additional or substitute coverage for the
benefit of Buyers relating to the Parent Insurances or the Business applicable
in any period after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding this provision, Seller
agrees that Seller or one of its Affiliates shall, with respect to any claim
or incident that arises or that relates to any Transferred Entity, that is
potentially covered by an occurrence-based insurance policy (each, a " _Parent
Occurrence Policy_ ") in effect prior to the Closing Date and as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 4.7 of the Seller Disclosure Letter_: (i) upon request of
Buyers, report such claim or incident to the appropriate insurer as promptly
as practicable and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Parent
Occurrence Policy; (ii) include, and consult with, Buyers on all
correspondence and possible litigation proceedings relating to such claim or
incident; and (iii) instruct that such proceeds are paid directly to the
injured party in settlement of any claims, rather than to Seller or its
Affiliates, or, if such proceeds are received by Seller or any of its
Affiliates, pay such proceeds over to (or as designated by) Buyers;
_provided_ that Buyers shall notify Seller promptly of any potential claim,
shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation and pursuit of any claim,
shall have the right to effectively associate in the pursuit of any claim,
including but not limited to the ability to withhold its consent to any
proposed claim settlement (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned,
withheld or delayed) and shall bear all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by Seller or its Affiliates in connection with the foregoing; and
_provided_ _further_ that, if requested by Buyers, Seller and its Affiliates
shall be obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers sole
cost, to pursue any claims that are potentially covered by available Parent
Insurance and shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, have any obligation to
commence (or participate in) any arbitration, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to any matter potentially covered by any Parent Occurrence
Policy. Buyers shall bear responsibility for any deductible or retention
payments required to be made under the Parent Occurrence Policies in
connection with claims made by (or on behalf of) Buyers.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller makes no representation or
warranty as to whether any recovery under any Parent Insurance will be
received with respect to any particular incident arising before or after the
Closing Date. Buyers agree that Seller shall not have any liability
under this Agreement or otherwise for any liabilities for failure by Buyers
or their respective Affiliates to report in a timely manner or for delays in
reporting by Buyers or their respective Affiliates that void any available
coverage under Parent Insurance.

Section 4.8 _Financing_.

 

(a) Silgan shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Debt
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(including any flex provisions), including by using reasonable best efforts
to: (i) maintain in effect the conditionality provisions of the Debt
Commitment Letter on the terms and conditions set forth in the
Debt Commitment Letter (or on terms not materially less favorable, in the
aggregate, to Silgan than the conditionality provisions of the Debt Commitment
Letter); (ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to
the Debt Financing (the " _Debt Financing Agreements_ ")

 



49  with conditionality provisions that are not materially less favorable, in
the aggregate, to Silgan than those contained in the Debt Commitment Letter;
(iii) ensure the accuracy of all representations and warranties of Silgan set
forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing Agreements; (iv) comply
with all covenants and agreements of Silgan set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or Debt Financing Agreements; (v) satisfy on a timely basis all
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter or Debt Financing
Agreements that are within its control; (vi) upon satisfaction of such
conditions and the other conditions set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions), consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing (and in
any event prior to the End Date); and (vii) seek to enforce its rights under
the Debt Commitment Letter. Silgan shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause the parties to the Debt Commitment Letter to fund on the Closing Date
the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including borrowing notwithstanding the fact that any "flex"
provisions in the Debt Commitment Letter are exercised. Silgan will furnish
to Seller correct and complete copies of any Alternative Commitment Letters
and ancillary documents thereto. The terms and conditions of the Debt
Commitment Letter and any Alternative Commitment Letters shall be reasonably
satisfactory in form and substance to Seller.

(b) Silgan shall promptly inform Seller in reasonable detail regarding all
material activity and timing considerations concerning the Debt Financing,
including any material adverse change with respect to the Debt Financing.
Without limiting the foregoing, Silgan agrees to notify Seller promptly, and
in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the
Closing Date: (i) the Debt Commitment Letter expires or is terminated for any
reason; (ii) a counterparty indicates in writing that it will not provide, or
it refuses to provide, all or any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated
by the Debt Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein; or (iii) for any
reason Silgan no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain
on a timely basis all or any portion of the Debt Financing on substantially
the terms described in the Debt Commitment Letter. Silgan shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of
Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), take any
action or enter into any transaction that could reasonably be expected to
impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or any portion of the Debt
Financing. Without the prior written consent of Seller (not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Silgan shall not permit
any amendment, modification or joinder to be made to, or any termination or
waiver of any provision under, the Debt Commitment Letter if such amendment,
modification, joinder, termination or waiver: (1) reduces the aggregate
amount of the Debt Financing; (2) imposes additional conditions precedent to
the availability of the Debt Financing or amends or modifies any of the
existing conditions to the funding of the Debt Financing in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date; or (3) materially adversely impacts the
ability of Silgan to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Debt
Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Silgan may, in its discretion
and without the consent of Seller, in lieu of obtaining the Debt
Financing pursuant to the Debt Commitment Letter, obtain the Debt Financing
by amending Silgans existing senior secured credit agreement or replacing
Silgans existing senior secured credit agreement on or prior to the Closing
Date so long as, in each case, such amended or replaced credit agreement: (w)
includes a valid and binding commitment by lenders thereunder

 



50  (except to the extent that: (i) enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or
other Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally; and (ii)
the availability of equitable remedies, including specific performance, is
subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding thereof may
be brought) to provide the Debt Financing in an amount not less than the
amount of the Debt Financing specified in the Debt Commitment Letter; (x) does
not impose additional conditions precedent to the availability of the Debt
Financing from those set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter; (y) does not
amend, modify or expand any of the existing conditions to the funding of the
Debt Financing set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to: (i) delay or prevent the funding of the
Debt Financing on the Closing Date; or (ii) make the funding of the Debt
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Debt Financing)
less likely to occur; and (z) does not adversely impact the ability of Silgan
to enforce its rights against the other parties to such agreements with
respect to the Debt Financing, the ability of Silgan to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the likelihood of consummation
of the purchase transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Silgan shall
promptly deliver to Seller copies of any amendment, modification, waiver,
joinder, termination or replacement of the Debt Commitment Letter or any
amended credit agreement or replacement credit agreement described in the
immediately preceding sentence.

(c) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Silgan
shall use its reasonable best efforts: (i) to arrange to promptly obtain such
Debt Financing from alternative sources with conditionality terms not
materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Silgan in an amount
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Debt Financing that is available
and Silgans cash on hand and funds available to Silgan under its existing
revolving credit facility, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by
Buyers in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Alternative Financing_ "); and (ii) to obtain a new financing commitment
letter (the " _Alternative Commitment Letter_ ") and a new definitive
agreement with respect thereto (the " _Alternative Financing Agreement_ "). In
such event, the term "Debt Financing" as used in this Agreement shall be
deemed to include any Alternative Financing, the term "Debt Commitment
Letter" as used in this Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative
Commitment Letter, and the term "Debt Financing Agreement" as used in this
Agreement shall be deemed to include any Alternative Financing Agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary and for the avoidance
of doubt, Buyers acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, is not a condition to Closing and
reaffirm their obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the Debt
Financing or any Alternative Financing, subject to fulfillment or waiver of
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE 6_.

 

Section 4.9 _Cooperation with Financing_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the Transferred Entities and
their respective officers, employees and advisors (including legal and
accounting) to provide such cooperation to Buyers as may reasonably be
requested by Buyers in connection with obtaining the Debt Financing necessary
to complete the transactions contemplated hereby, including the 

 



51  following: (i) providing to Buyers and their Financing Sources the Required
Financial Information; (ii) at reasonable times and upon reasonable notice,
participating in a reasonable number of road shows, meetings, due diligence
sessions and similar presentations to and with prospective lenders, investors
and rating agencies; (iii) using reasonable best efforts to facilitate the
pledging of collateral as required under the Debt Financing; (iv) taking all
actions reasonably requested to facilitate arrangements for the termination
and discharge as of the Closing Date of any Indebtedness of the Transferred
Entities of the type described in _Section_ __ _ 1.2(c)_, including
obtaining customary release letters and lien terminations; (v) furnishing
Buyers and their Financing Sources promptly (but in any event at least five
(5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date) with all documentation and other
information required by regulatory authorities under applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
PATRIOT Act, that has been requested by the Financing Sources in connection
with securing the Debt Financing; and (vi) causing the taking of corporate and
other actions by the Companies necessary or reasonably advisable to permit the
consummation of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to Buyers as of the Closing Date, it
being understood and agreed that no such corporate or other action shall take
effect prior to Closing; it being understood that Seller shall have satisfied
its obligations set forth in this sentence, other than with respect to its

have used its reasonable best efforts to comply with such obligations
whether or not any applicable deliverables are actually obtained or provided.
Seller consents to the reasonable use of the Transferred Entities logos in
connection with any Debt Financing in a manner customary for such financing
transactions,  _provided_ that such logos are used solely in a manner that is
not intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage any Transferred
Entity or the reputation or goodwill of any Transferred Entity or any of such
Transferred Entitys Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1) nothing
contained in this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ shall require cooperation with Buyers
to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the Business and operations
of Seller or the Transferred Entities, encumber any of the assets of Seller
or, prior to the Closing, the Transferred Entities, require Seller or, prior
to the Closing, the Transferred Entities to pay any commitment or other fee or
make any other payment in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the
Closing Date (unless simultaneously reimbursed by Buyers pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement), result in a breach of any contract in effect as of the
date hereof, or impose any liability on Seller or, prior to the Closing, any
of the Transferred Entities; and (2) none of Seller, any Transferred Entity or
any of their respective directors, officers, managers or employees, shall: (A)
be required to take any action in the capacity as a member of the board of
directors of any of the Transferred Entities to authorize or approve the Debt
Financing; (B) have any liability or any obligation under any Debt Financing
Agreement or any other agreement or document related to the Debt Financing;
or (C) be required to incur any other liability in connection with the Debt
Financing, _provided_ that clauses (B) and (C) shall only apply to the
Transferred Entities prior to the Closing.

 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 7.1_ (other than  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_), Buyers shall
promptly, upon request by Seller, indemnify and hold harmless the Seller
Indemnitees for and against any and all out-of-pocket Losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing, any
action taken by them at the request of Buyers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.9_ and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than

in _Section_ __ _ 4.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter_, except as otherwise

Section 4.11 _Replacement Letters of Credit; Replacement Guarantees and
Replacement Credit Support_.

 

(a) Buyers covenant and agree that they shall use best efforts to obtain

Transferred Entity or the Business (" _Seller Letters of Credit_ ") effective
as of the Closing Date that have been identified to Buyers for substitution or
replacement prior to the date hereof in _Section_ __ _ 4.11(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter_, or that have been entered into in the ordinary course of
business, and identified to Buyers as such, after the date hereof.

(b) Buyers further covenant and agree that they shall use best efforts to
obtain the release of the guarantees extended by Seller or its Affiliates
(other than a Transferred Entity) on behalf of a Transferred Entity or the
Business (" _Seller Guarantees_ ") effective as of the Closing Date that have
been identified to Buyers for release prior to the date hereof in _Section_ __
_ 4.11(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_, or that have been entered into in
the ordinary course of business, and identified to Buyers as such, after the
date hereof.

(c) Buyers further covenant and agree that they shall use best efforts to
put in place replacement credit support arrangements acceptable to the
relevant counterparties to substitute for the credit support currently
provided by Seller and its Affiliates on behalf of a Transferred Entity or
the Business (" _Seller Credit Support_ ") effective as of the Closing Date
that have been identified to Buyers for replacement prior to the date hereof
in _Section_ __ _ 4.11(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_, or that have
been entered into in the ordinary course of business, and identified to Buyers
as such, after the date hereof.

 

(d) It is the intention and understanding of Buyers and Seller that such
Seller Letters of Credit, Seller Guarantees and Seller Credit Support will be
replaced, canceled and terminated in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
4.11_ as of the Closing Date; _however_ , notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, no Seller Letters of Credit, Seller Guarantees or Seller Credit
Support shall be cancelled or terminated until Buyers shall have obtained
replacements thereof pursuant to the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_.
Following the Closing, Buyers shall indemnify and hold Seller and its
Subsidiaries and Affiliates harmless from any and all payments required to be
made under, and costs and expenses incurred in connection with, any such
Seller Letters of Credit, Seller Guarantees or Seller Credit Support that
have not been replaced as of the Closing Date. From and after the date on
which Buyers have obtained replacements thereof or releases therefrom in each
case pursuant to and in accordance with this 

 



53   _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, Seller and its Affiliates shall have no further
obligation or liability (contingent or otherwise) under such Seller Letters of
Credit, Seller Guarantees and Seller Credit Support.

(e) For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_, "best efforts" shall
include Buyers providing, to the extent necessary, cash collateral acceptable
to the relevant counterparty to obtain the replacement of any Seller Letter of
Credit, Seller Guarantee or Seller Credit Support with a letter of credit,
guarantee or grant of security or other form of credit support, as applicable,
provided by Buyers or the Transferred Entities, and the release of Seller and
its Affiliates in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.11_.

relating to such Pre-Transfer Time Workers Compensation Claims. Buyers and
their respective Affiliates shall be liable for all Workers Compensation
Claims with respect to the Transferred Employees incurred on or after the
Transfer Time. A Workers Compensation Claim is deemed to be incurred at the
time of the injury, illness or other event that gives rise to a claim for such
benefits, _provided_ that, with respect to any Workers Compensation Claims
that are reported to Seller (or any of its Affiliates) or Buyers (or any of
their respective Affiliates) on or after the Transfer Time and that arise out
of continuing work place exposures or repetitive injuries or occurrences
occurring both before and after the Transfer Time, Buyers shall retain all

_Section_ __ _ 2.6(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ and all intercompany
indebtedness not evidenced by written agreement) between Seller and its
Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities), on the one hand, and the
Transferred Entities, on the other, to be settled or terminated prior to the
Closing without any liability on the part of any Buyer or any of its

Losses to the Transferred Entities in excess of $2,500,000 unless Seller, in a
written notice to Buyers, grants Buyers the right, within ten (10) Business
Days after Buyers receipt of such notice, to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ (and such notice expressly states that
Seller shall mutually agree to so terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.1(a)_ if Buyers choose to do so).

(b) In the event Buyers choose not to terminate this Agreement as provided
in the proviso in  _Section_ __ _ 4.15(a)_, such supplement to the Seller
Disclosure Letter in respect of such Supplemental Disclosure Matters shall be
permitted and if made will be deemed to have cured any inaccuracy of the

such Supplemental Disclosure Matters proposed to be disclosed in such
supplements, in the aggregate, either have or would reasonably be anticipated
to result in Losses to the Transferred Entities in excess of $1,000,000.

connection with the continued operation of the Business in a manner

or Sellers or its Affiliates business or reputation, or that is intended to
harm the value, reputation or distinctiveness of or Sellers goodwill in any
Seller Mark, it being understood that Buyers shall be deemed not to have
violated the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 4.16(b)(ii)_ if any Buyer or
its Affiliates use any Seller Mark in substantially the same manner used by
the Transferred Entities prior to the Closing; (2) register or file
applications to register in any jurisdiction any Seller Mark or any trademark,
service mark, trade dress, trade name, domain name, social media user name or

of the Business and the Transferred Entities with Seller and its Affiliates;
or (ii) as required by applicable Law.

Section 4.17 _Payments from Third Parties_. In the event that, on or
after the Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other funds

Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), neither WestRock nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall engage, directly or indirectly, in the Territory in
the Business as it exists on the Closing Date (a " _Competing Business_ ");
_provided_ that nothing herein shall prohibit: (i) the acquisition by WestRock
or any of its Subsidiaries of, or the investment by WestRock or any of
its Subsidiaries in, a business having not more than 25% of its sales (based
on its latest annual financial statements at the time of the acquisition)
attributable to any Competing Business, it being understood that if WestRock
subsequently determines to divest such Competing Business within the
Restricted Period following the consummation of such acquisition, WestRock
shall include Silgan as a potential purchaser in such discussions, but
WestRock shall have no obligation to divest such Competing Business to Silgan
or grant to Silgan any "right of first offer" or "right of first refusal" to
purchase such Competing Business; (ii) _ provided_ that WestRock shall only
be permitted under this subclause (ii) to consummate one (1) such acquisition
until it has divested the Competing Business as contemplated in this subclause
(ii), the acquisition by WestRock or any of its Subsidiaries of, or the
investment by WestRock or any of its Subsidiaries in, a business having more
than 25% but less than 50% of its sales (based on its latest annual financial
statements at the time of the acquisition) attributable to any Competing
Business, so long as WestRock uses its commercially reasonable efforts
to divest such Competing Business within eighteen (18) months following the
consummation of such acquisition, it being understood that WestRock shall
include Silgan as a potential purchaser in such discussions, but WestRock
shall have no obligation to divest such Competing Business to Silgan or grant
to Silgan any "right of first offer" or "right of first refusal" to purchase

equity interests of such Person; or (iv) the acquisition, holding for
investment or direct or indirect ownership by WestRock or any of its
Subsidiaries of any voting stock, capital stock or other equity interest of
any Person (not controlled by WestRock or any of its Subsidiaries) who at the
time of such investment or acquisition of ownership did not engage in a
Competing Business but who thereafter engages in a Competing Business so long
as WestRock or any of its Subsidiaries do not make any additional investments
in, or exercise any additional control over, such Person following such
Persons determination to engage in a Competing Business (other than such
investments required to be made by WestRock or any of its Subsidiaries
pursuant to any Contract entered into prior to such determination). For the
avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding the foregoing, the development,
manufacture, sale and/or servicing of any products sold or in production in a
line of business other than the Business (as conducted on the Closing Date) by
WestRock or any of its Affiliates shall not be considered a Competing
Business, and a Competing Business shall not include the development,

Competing Business acquires all or substantially all of WestRocks assets.
This _Section_ __ _ 4.19_ does not apply to any Subsidiary of WestRock in
which a Person who is not an Affiliate of WestRock holds equity interests and
with respect to whom WestRock or such Subsidiary of WestRock, as applicable,
has contractual or legal obligations as of the date of this Agreement
(including fiduciary duties of representatives on the board of directors or
similar body of such Subsidiary) limiting WestRocks ability to impose on the

in  _Section_ __ _ 4.19(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_; (iii) WestRock
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit for employment or hire any Offer Employees who did not accept
any Buyers or one of its Affiliates offer of employment ( _provided_ that

accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.4_ of this Agreement); and (iv) WestRock

__ _ 4.19_ are an essential element of this Agreement and that, but for these
covenants, the parties would not have entered into this Agreement. The parties
acknowledge that this  _Section_ __ _ 4.19_ constitutes an independent
covenant and shall not be affected by performance or nonperformance of any

covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 4.19_ is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, such restrictions or covenants shall not be held to be null, void
and of no effect, but to the extent such restrictions or covenants would be
valid or enforceable under any applicable Law, if modified, a court of
competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or modify this  _Section_
__ _ 4.19_ to provide for a covenant having the maximum enforceable
geographic area, time period and scope that would be valid and enforceable
under such applicable Law.

shall be borne by Seller and Seller shall indemnify and reimburse Buyers and
all of their Affiliates (including Transferred Entities) for any fees,
taxes, costs and other expenses incurred by any Buyer or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) for any of the
Restructuring Transactions.

 

Section 4.24 _Retained and Returned Cash_.

 

(a) Buyers and Seller acknowledge that, as of the Closing, certain of the
Transferred Entities may continue to maintain cash balances in bank accounts
to continue to operate their businesses, and, as soon as practicable after the
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyers reasonably satisfactory evidence of
the amounts contained in such bank accounts as of the close of business on
the day prior to the Closing (the " _Bank Account Balances_ "). _Section
4.24(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ sets forth Sellers good faith
estimate of the Bank Account Balances for each of the Transferred Entities
set forth therein (each such account, the " _Estimated Cash Balance_ "). No
later than sixty (60) days following Buyers receipt from Seller of reasonably
satisfactory evidence of the Bank Account Balances, Buyers will notify Seller
in writing (the " _Cash Notice_ ") which Bank Account Balances (or portion
thereof) Buyers elects to retain (the " _Retained Funds_ ") and which Bank
Account Balances (or portion thereof) Buyers elect to return to the
applicable Selling Entity (the " _Returned Funds_ "). If a Cash Notice has not
been delivered within sixty (60) days following Buyers receipt from Seller of
reasonably satisfactory evidence of the Bank Account Balances, then all Bank
Account Balances shall be deemed to be Retained Funds. The parties hereto
agree that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the amount of the
Retained Funds identified by Buyers in the Cash Notice in respect of
any Transferred Entity listed on _Section 4.24(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter_ shall be no less than the amount of the Estimated Cash Balance set
forth in _Section 4.24(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ for such
Transferred Entity,  _provided_ that if the amount of the Bank Account
Balance of such Transferred Entity is less than the amount of the Estimated
Cash Balance set forth in _Section 4.24(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_
for such Transferred Entity, then the amount of the Retained Funds identified
by Buyers in the Cash Notice for such Transferred Entity shall be the amount
of the Bank Account Balance of such Transferred Entity.

 

(b) _Section 4.24(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter_ sets forth the
functional currency of each of the Selling Entities. With respect to the
Retained Funds, the applicable Buyer shall pay to the applicable Selling
Entity an amount equal to the applicable Transferred Entitys respective
portion of the Retained Funds, in the functional currency of the Selling
Entity receiving such payment based on the exchange rate equal to the average
of the prevailing exchange rate for transactions in such currency as published
by _The Wall Street Journal_ published on each of the five (5)
consecutive Business Days immediately preceding the date of

 



61  such payment, as an adjustment to the portion of the Final Purchase Price
allocated to such Transferred Entity. Such amounts shall be payable to the
applicable Seller Designated Accounts or such other accounts that shall be
designated in writing by the applicable Selling Entity. The total amount
payable by Buyers to Selling Entities pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
4.24(b)_ shall be referred to as the " _Retained Funds Purchase Price_." In
each case under this _Section_ __ _ 4.24(b)_, the applicable Buyer shall pay
and deliver the applicable Selling Entitys respective portion of the Retained
Funds Purchase Price by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
applicable Seller Designated Account(s) or such other account(s) designated in
writing by the applicable Selling Entity as the case may be within five (5)
Business Days following delivery of the Cash Notice (or the date such Cash
Notice was required to be delivered if not so delivered).

(c) With respect to the Returned Funds, each applicable Buyer shall take
reasonable and appropriate steps to cause the applicable Transferred Entities
to transfer the Returned Funds, in the same currency as the Returned Funds, to
such applicable Buyer. Thereafter, the applicable Buyer shall pay to the
applicable Selling Entity of such applicable Transferred Entity, as an
adjustment to the portion of the Final Purchase Price allocated to such
Transferred Entity, an amount, in the functional currency of the
Selling Entity receiving such payment based on the exchange rate actually
obtained by Buyers or their Affiliates for such exchange of funds through Bank
of America, N.A. on the date of payment, equal to the net value of the
Returned Funds (after deducting all actual fees, taxes, costs and other
expenses with appropriate support with respect thereto relating to the
transfer by the applicable Transferred Entities to the applicable Buyer and
thereafter the payment to the applicable Selling Entities by the applicable
Buyer), by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the applicable
Seller Designated Accounts or such other accounts that shall be designated in
writing by the applicable Selling Entity, within five (5) Business Days
after such applicable Buyers receipt of the Returned Funds from the
applicable Transferred Entity. From and after any payment to any Selling
Entity by any Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.24(c)_, such Selling
Entity shall indemnify and reimburse such Buyer and all of its Affiliates
(including Transferred Entities) for any fees, taxes, costs and other expenses
incurred by such Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates but not
accounted for as deductions in the calculation of the net value of the
Returned Funds pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.24(c)_.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section_ __ _ 4.24_,
the amount of the capital contribution to be made to WestRock (Wuxi)
Dispensing Systems Ltd. (the " _China Transferred Entity_ ") in connection
with the Restructuring Transactions (as referenced in __Schedule 10.1__ under
the heading Non-Employee Transfers, China, in clause (a)) shall not be subject
to this _Section_ __ _ 4.24_, but only up to the amount that is outstanding
on the Wuxi Intercompany Loan on the Closing Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, (i) any cash balances of the China Transferred Entity in bank accounts
in China immediately prior to the Closing to the extent in excess of cash
balances included in the Estimated Cash Balance for the China
Transferred Entity shall remain with the China Transferred Entity after the
Closing and shall not constitute Retained Funds or Returned Funds hereunder;
and (ii) no Buyer shall have any obligation to make any payment to any Selling
Entity with respect to any such cash balances of the China Transferred
Entity.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this  _Section_ __ _
4.24_, with respect to any Returned Funds that Buyer, following reasonable
directions from Seller, is unable to cause

 



62  the Transferred Entities to transfer to the applicable Buyer within one
hundred twenty (120) days following the date of delivery of the Cash Notice,
such Returned Funds shall remain with the Transferred Entities and no Buyer
shall have any obligation to make any payment to any Selling Entity relating
thereto.

 

Section 4.25 _Termination of Profit Pooling Agreement_.

 

(a) Seller shall cause the profit pooling agreement ( _Gewinnabf
uhrungsvertrag_) between the German Selling Entity and the German Transferred
Entity dated 14 December 2007, as amended (the " _Profit Pooling Agreement_
"), to be terminated for cause pursuant to paragraph 4 of Section 4 therein,
effective as of the end of the day (local time of the German Transferred
Entity) on which Closing occurs.

(b) Together with the Closing Statement to be delivered to Seller
following the Closing pursuant to and in accordance with _Section 1.3(c)_ ,
the U.S. Buyer, on behalf of itself and the other Buyers, shall prepare and
deliver to Seller a draft balance sheet and a draft profit and loss statement
in respect of the German Transferred Entity covering the period commencing on
the first day of the German Transferred Entitys current fiscal year ( _i.e_.,
1 October 2016) and ending on (and including) the day on which
the termination of the Profit Pooling Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
4.25(a)_ becomes effective (such period, the " _Profit Pooling Period_ ," and
such draft balance sheet and draft profit and loss statement, the " _Draft
Profit Pooling Accounts_ ").

(c) Within sixty (60) days of receipt of the Draft Profit Pooling
Accounts, Seller may provide written notice to the U.S. Buyer disputing all or
a part of the Draft Profit Pooling Accounts (which notice Seller may deliver
to the U.S. Buyer together with, or separate from, any Purchase Price Dispute
Notice delivered to the U.S. Buyer by Seller pursuant to _Section
1.3(c)(iii)_ ). If Seller does not provide such a dispute notice described in
the first sentence of this _Section 4.25(c)_ to the U.S. Buyer within such
sixty (60)-day period, then the parties agree that the Draft Profit Pooling
Accounts and the amounts identified therein shall become final and binding on
the parties hereto. If such a dispute notice is provided to the U.S. Buyer,
then the U.S. Buyer and Seller shall use reasonable efforts to resolve the
disputed items during the thirty (30)-day period commencing on the date of the
U.S. Buyers receipt of such dispute notice. If Seller and the U.S. Buyer do
not agree upon a final resolution with respect to any disputed items in the
Draft Profit Pooling Accounts within such thirty (30)-day period, then the
remaining items in dispute in respect of the Draft Profit Pooling Accounts
shall be submitted to the Accounting Firm and resolved in accordance with the
processes and procedures set forth in _Sections 1.3(c)(iv)_ through
_1.3(c)(v)_ (including the timeframes prescribed therein) to determine the
final and binding Profit Pooling Accounts.

For purposes of this  _Section_ __ _ 4.25_, the Profit Pooling Accounts
shall be prepared in accordance with the statutory provisions of the German
Commercial Code ( _Handelsgesetzbuch_ ) and with the accounting principles
generally accepted in Germany (German GAAP), as applied consistently with
past practice.

(d) Seller and the Netherlands Buyer shall cause the German Selling Entity
and the German Transferred Entity, respectively, to duly perform the Profit
Pooling Agreement for the Profit Pooling Period, including, without
limitation, due performance of any profit 

 



63  transfer obligation of the German Transferred Entity and any loss
compensation obligation of the German Selling Entity. The amount to be
transferred by the German Transferred Entity under its profit transfer
obligation or, as the case may be, by the German Selling Entity under its loss
compensation obligation, shall be bindingly determined on the basis of the
Profit Pooling Accounts.

 

(e) Within three (3) Business Days after the date on which the Draft Profit
Pooling Accounts have become final and binding Profit Pooling Accounts
pursuant to _Section 4.25(c)_ (the " _Profit Pooling Payment Date_ "):

 

(i) The amount of any profit generated by the German Transferred Entity
during the Profit Pooling Period (as finally determined in the final and
binding Profit Pooling Accounts) shall be transferred to the German Selling
Entity (net of taxes) by cash payment from the German Transferred Entity to
the German Selling Entity (the amount of such cash payment, the " _Profit
Pooling Deduction Amount_ "). On the Profit Pooling Payment Date, the German
Selling Entity shall pay to the Netherlands Buyer an amount in cash equal to
the Profit Pooling Deduction Amount, which shall be treated as a reduction to
the Final Purchase Price allocated to the German Transferred Entity that was
paid to the German Selling Entity. For the avoidance of doubt, the obligation
of the German Transferred Entity to pay the Profit Pooling Deduction
Amount to the German Selling Entity shall not be regarded as Indebtedness.
Notwithstanding the provisions of _ARTICLE_ __ _ 5_, the German Selling
Entity shall bear and pay, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Buyers from
and against any and all withholding taxes resulting from such profit
transfer; _provided_ , _however_ , _Sections 5.4_ through _5.6_ and _Section_
__ _ 5.10_ shall apply accordingly. If the German Transferred
Entity withholds withholding tax on the Profit Pooling Deduction Amount, then
Buyers shall cause the German Transferred Entity to issue to the German
Selling Entity on the Profit Pooling Payment Date a proper certificate of
withholding tax  _(Kapitalertragsteuerbescheinigung)_ resulting from such
profit transfer.

(ii) In the event that losses instead of profits are generated by the
German Transferred Entity during the Profit Pooling Period (as finally
determined in the final and binding Profit Pooling Accounts), the German
Selling Entity will compensate the German Transferred Entity for such losses
by cash payment in the amount of such losses from the German Selling Entity to
the German Transferred Entity (the amount of such cash payment, the " _Profit
Pooling Increase Amount_ "). On the Profit Pooling Payment Date, the
Netherlands Buyer shall pay to Seller or its designee an amount in cash equal
to the Profit Pooling Increase Amount, which shall be treated as an increase
to the Final Purchase Price allocated to the German Transferred Entity
that was paid to the German Selling Entity.

All cash payments made in connection with the transactions contemplated under
this _Section 4.25(e)_ (whether to or from the German Transferred Entity, the
German Selling Entity, the Netherlands Buyer or any other Buyers, Seller or
Sellers designees) shall be paid in Euros.

 

(f) If, after Closing, the German Transferred Entity or any third party
asserts any claims against the German Selling Entity on the grounds of the
German Selling Entitys

 



64  obligation to compensate losses of the German Transferred Entity or
excessive profit transfer from the German Transferred Entity to the German
Selling Entity that occurred under the Profit Pooling Agreement or, if and to
the extent the respective underlying obligation (a) existed on the Closing
Date and is explicitly reflected in the Profit Pooling Accounts or (b) came
into existence after the Closing Date, to provide security pursuant to §303
German Stock Corporations Act ( _Aktiengesetz_ , _AktG_ ) by analogy (in
_analoger_ _Anwendung_ ), then Buyers shall bear and pay, reimburse,
indemnify, hold harmless and defend Seller and the German Selling Entity in
respect of such obligation. The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall apply
accordingly with regard to such defense. The claim of Seller and the German
Selling Entity to be reimbursed, indemnified, held harmless and defended by
Buyers shall not become time-barred unless and until: (i) the asserted claim
has become time-barred; and (ii) the time-barring of such claim is not
contested by the German Transferred Entity or the respective third party. For
the avoidance of doubt, the obligation of Buyers includes the defense against
any claims or allegations by the German Transferred Entity or the respective
third party that such asserted claim has not become time-barred.

 

(g) Buyers shall cause the German Transferred Entity to: (i) ensure that
the German Selling Entity is given the opportunity to fully participate (at
the German Selling Entitys cost) in (including the participation in all
meetings and other conversations or exchanges with the tax authorities and
review any reports and all relevant tax audit, administrative or legal
procedure documents) any tax proceedings which take place after the Closing
Date and which are related to any Tax Matters of the German Transferred Entity
for which the German Selling Entity is liable under the fiscal
unit established by the Profit Pooling Agreement (the " _German Fiscal Unit
Tax Matters_ "); (ii) upon Sellers request and at Sellers cost, file
objections or other protests or appeals against Tax assessments or challenge
and litigate any Tax assessment or other decision of any tax authority which
are related to German Fiscal Unit Tax Matters; and (iii) comply with Sellers
instructions at Sellers cost in relation to the conduct of the tax
proceedings related to German Fiscal Unit Tax Matters. If Seller elects to
assume control of the tax proceedings (in which case all costs and expenses
incurred by the German Transferred Entity in connection with such tax
proceedings shall be borne by Seller), then Buyers shall cause the German
Transferred Entity to authorize (by power-of-attorney and such other
documentation as may be necessary or appropriate) the
designated representative of the German Selling Entity to represent the
German Transferred Entity in the tax proceedings related to German Fiscal Unit
Tax Matters. In any case, Buyers shall not and shall cause the German
Transferred Entity not to furnish any information relating to tax proceedings
related to German Fiscal Unit Tax Matters, compromise, dispose of or settle
any tax proceedings related to German Fiscal Unit Tax Matters or to let them
become time-barred without the prior written consent of Seller or the German
Selling Entity. To the extent there is any inconsistency between this _Section
4.25(g)_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ as to any German Fiscal Unit Tax Matters,
the provisions of this _Section 4.25(g)_ shall control.

Section 4.26 _Calmar SPA Indemnity_. To the extent that any Buyer or
Transferred Entity or any of their Affiliates are subject to any Losses that
arise after the Closing related to the City of Industry Liabilities for which
Seller would be entitled to indemnification under the Calmar SPA (a " _Calmar
SPA Indemnity Claim_ "), Seller covenants and agrees to diligently and
expediently pursue, with legal counsel reasonably acceptable to Buyers, such
Calmar SPA Indemnity Claim upon receipt of a claim for such Losses from Buyers
and to indemnify Buyers 

 



65  from and against any such Losses, subject to the limitations set forth in
the last two sentences of this _Section_ __ _ 4.26_. Buyers shall be
responsible for all third-party costs related to Sellers bringing such
Calmar SPA Indemnity Claim pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 4.26_, including
all third-party attorneys fees, and in the event that Seller does not
diligently and expediently pursue such Calmar SPA Indemnity Claim, Buyer
shall be entitled to select legal counsel in its sole discretion and pursue
such Calmar SPA Indemnity Claim on behalf of Seller at Buyers sole expense.
Sellers indemnification obligations to Buyers under this _Section_ __ _
4.26_ shall survive to the same extent Sellers indemnity rights survive under
the Calmar SPA. Sellers liability to Buyers for any such Losses arising
from the City of Industry Liabilities shall be limited to the amount of any
indemnification Seller actually receives from Saint-Gobain Corporation or any
other entity under the Calmar SPA, net of any unreimbursed third-party costs
incurred to pursue such claim.

Section 4.27 _Preparation for TSA Implementation_. Promptly after the date
hereof, representatives of Seller and Buyers shall meet to prepare for an
orderly implementation of the Transition Services Agreement on the Closing
Date, and they shall continue to periodically meet as necessary to achieve
this goal prior to the Closing Date. In this respect, such activities shall
include, without limitation:

(a) The designation of primary contacts for each party to facilitate the
discussion and resolution of issues related to each scope of services
identified in the Transition Services Agreement;

 

(b) The expected timetables, format and content of month and quarter end
deliverables (e.g., trial balances, financial statement formats and tax
accounting-relevant data);

(c) The expected documentation around tax compliance and other matters;

(d) Processes to be determined in advance of closing and on an ongoing
basis with Silgans approval, relating to risk related decisions such as
setting of credit limits, customer contact, past due invoices, credit holds,
setting of reserves, outstanding deductions, write-offs, etc.;

 

(e) The expected training for Buyers personnel on Sellers systems and
processes as appropriate that will be transferred to Buyers and that rely on
Seller during the Service Period (as defined in the Transition Services
Agreement);

 

(f) The structure and process of payments of both ongoing services and one-
time costs; and

(g) The expected timetable for transitioning from legacy Seller systems and
processes to Buyers systems and processes.

TAX MATTERS

 

Section 5.1 _Responsibility for Taxes_. Seller shall bear and pay,
reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Buyers from and against any and all
Indemnified Taxes. Buyers shall bear

 



66  and pay, reimburse, indemnify and hold harmless Seller from and against any
and all Taxes imposed on or assessed against any of the Transferred Entities
for any Post-Closing Tax Period.

 

Section 5.2 _Straddle Periods_.

 

(a) In the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be
determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the period ending on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle
Period.

 

(b) In the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including Income
Taxes, employment Taxes and sales and use Taxes), the amount attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date, on the basis of
a closing of the books as of the Closing, _provided_ that exemptions,
allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis (including,
but not limited to, depreciation and amortization deductions) shall be
allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period
using the methodology set forth in clause (a).

(c) In the case of Taxes imposed on any Transferred Entity or any other
Buyer Indemnitee as a result of income of any Flow-Thru Entity realized on or
prior to the Closing Date (such income being computed assuming the Flow-Thru
Entity had a year that ends on the Closing Date and closed its books as of the
Closing), such Taxes shall be treated as Taxes of the Transferred Entities
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

Section 5.3 _Refunds; Income Tax Assets; Post-Closing Date Losses_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, all refunds of Taxes (other than
refunds of Transfer Taxes, which shall be allocated in the same manner as
Transfer Taxes are allocated under _Section_ __ _ 5.7_) of the Transferred
Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period (or portion of a Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date as determined in accordance with the same
principles provided for in _Section_ __ _ 5.2_) (whether in the form of cash
received from the applicable Governmental Authority or a credit against
Taxes that are not Indemnified Taxes) that are received on or before the date
of expiration of the applicable statute of limitations shall be for the
benefit of Seller. To the extent that any Buyer, the Transferred Entities or
any of their Affiliates receive a refund that is for the benefit of Seller,
such Buyer, Transferred Entity or Affiliate shall pay to Seller the amount of
such refund (without interest other than interest received from the
Governmental Authority), net of: (i) any Taxes imposed with respect to such
refund (including any Taxes that would be imposed on a distribution of any
portion of such refund to such Buyer); and (ii) any reasonable third-
party out-of-pocket expenses that such Buyer, the Transferred Entities or any
of their Affiliates incur (or has incurred or will incur) with respect to such
refund (and related interest). The net amount due to Seller shall be payable
ten (10) days after receipt of the refund from the applicable Governmental
Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of a credit, ten (10) days after
filing the Tax Return claiming such credit).

 



67 (b) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ shall require that Buyers make
any payment with respect to any refund of Tax (and such refunds shall be for
the benefit of Buyers and the Transferred Entities) that is with respect to:
(i) any refund of any Indemnified Tax paid after the Closing Date to
the extent Seller has not indemnified Buyers or the applicable Transferred
Entity for such Taxes; (ii) any refund of Tax that was taken into account as
an asset in determining "Prepaid Income Taxes" or "Income Taxes
Payable" (such terms referring to the line items shown in _Exhibit B_ )
reflected in the calculation of the Final Closing True-Up Amount; or (iii) any
refund of Tax that gives rise to a payment obligation by any Transferred
Entity to any Person under applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of a
contract or other agreement entered into (or assumed) by the Transferred
Entity on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) Neither any Buyer nor any of the Transferred Entities shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Tax Law, carryback to a Pre-Closing Tax Period
any item of loss, deduction or credit or any net operating loss, net capital
loss or other Tax credit or benefit that is attributable to, arises from or
relates to any taxable period (or portion thereof) commencing after the
Closing Date.

Section 5.4 _Tax Returns_.

 

(a) Seller shall be responsible for preparing: (i) all Consolidated or
Combined Returns; (ii) all Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities due on or
prior (after taking into account all appropriate extensions) to the Closing
Date; and (iii) all Tax Returns of the Transferred Entities related to Income
Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, other than any Tax Returns with respect
to Straddle Periods (" _Seller Prepared Returns_ "). All Seller Prepared
Returns (other than Consolidated or Combined Returns) shall be prepared in
accordance with existing procedures, practices and accounting methods of the
Transferred Entities. Each Seller Prepared Return (other than Consolidated or
Combined Return) that is required to be filed by any of the
Transferred Entities after the Closing Date shall be submitted to Buyers at
least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return.
Seller shall consider in good faith any reasonable comments made by Buyers in
finalizing such Tax Return. Buyers shall cause the applicable Transferred
Entity to file any Seller Prepared Return delivered to Buyers that was
prepared in accordance with the two preceding sentences.

 

(b) Buyers shall be responsible for preparing and filing all other Tax
Returns relating to the Business or assets of the Transferred Entities;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of any such Tax Return: (i) for a
Straddle Period that relates to Income Taxes; or (ii) that was not prepared
consistent with existing procedures, practices and accounting methods and
shows an Indemnified Tax, not later than twenty (20) days prior to the due
date for filing such Tax Return by Buyers, Buyers shall provide Seller with a
copy of relevant portions of the draft of such Tax Return for Sellers
approval.

(c) Without the prior written consent of Seller (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), Buyers shall not, and shall
not permit any of their respective Affiliates to, amend any Tax Returns or
make or change any Tax elections or accounting methods, in each case with
respect to any of the Transferred Entities relating to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period or a Straddle Period if such action could reasonably be expected to
cause Seller or any of its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) to
be liable for any Tax 

 



68  (including any Indemnified Tax) or could reasonably be expected to reduce
the amount of refund for the benefit of Buyers (determined in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_), except to the extent required by applicable Tax Law.

(d) In the event of any disagreement between Buyers and Seller regarding
any Tax Return furnished by Seller to Buyers or Buyers to Seller for approval
under _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_ that cannot be resolved by the tenth (10th) day
prior to the due date for such Tax Return, such disagreement shall be
resolved by an accounting firm of international reputation mutually agreeable
to Buyers and Seller (the " _Tax Accountant_ "), and any such determination by
the Tax Accountant shall be final. The fees and expenses of the Tax
Accountant shall be borne equally by Buyers and Seller. If the Tax Accountant
does not resolve any differences between Buyers and Seller with respect to
such Tax Return at least two (2) days prior to the due date therefor, such
Tax Return shall be timely filed by Buyers as prepared by Seller or Buyers (as
the case may be) and shall be amended as may be necessary to reflect the Tax
Accountants resolution.

 

Section 5.5 _Tax Contests_.

 

(a) Buyers or Seller, as the case may be, shall notify the other party
within twenty (20) days after receipt by such party or any of its Affiliates
of written notice of any pending federal, state, local or foreign Tax audit or
examination or notice of deficiency or other adjustment, assessment or
redetermination relating to Taxes for which such other party or its
Affiliates may be responsible under _Section_ __ _ 5.1_, _Section_ __ _ 5.2_
or _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ (" _Tax Matters_ ").

 

(b) Seller shall have the sole right to control, contest, resolve and
defend against any Tax Matters relating to: (i) any Tax Return of any of the
Transferred Entities for a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than any Straddle
Period) to the extent that Seller is reasonably likely to be obligated to
indemnify Buyers for a significant portion of any resulting Taxes or other
related Losses under _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ (a " _Transferred Entity Tax Matter_
"); and (ii) any Consolidated or Combined Return; _provided_ , _however_
, that: (i) Seller shall control such Tax Matter diligently and in good
faith; (ii) Buyers shall have the right to participate in any Transferred
Entity Tax Matter at its sole cost and expense; and (iii) Seller shall not,
and shall not permit its Affiliates to, concede, settle or compromise a
Transferred Entity Tax Matter (or portion thereof) controlled by Seller under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to the extent such concession, settlement or
compromise could reasonably be expected to give rise to a Tax or related Loss
that Seller is not obligated to indemnify under _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ without
the consent of Buyers, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed, or conditioned.

(c) Buyers shall have the sole right to control all Tax Matters of the
Transferred Entities not controlled by Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _
5.5(b)_; _provided_ , _however_ , that: (i) Seller, at its sole cost and
expense, shall have the right to participate in any such Tax Matter to the
extent it relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period and for
which Seller may be obligated, in whole or in part, to indemnify Buyers under
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_; and (ii) Buyers shall not, and shall not permit its
Affiliates to, concede, settle or compromise a Tax Matter (or portion thereof)
controlled by Buyers under this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ to the extent such
concession, settlement or compromise could reasonably be expected to give
rise to an indemnification obligation by Seller under _Section_ __ _ 5.1_
without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed, or conditioned.

 



69 Section 5.6 _Books and Records; Cooperation_. Buyers and Seller shall
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates to): (a) provide the other party
and its Affiliates with such assistance as may be reasonably requested in
connection with the preparation of any Tax Return or any audit or other
examination by any taxing authority or any judicial or administrative
proceeding relating to Taxes; and (b) retain (and provide the other party and
its Affiliates with reasonable access to) all records or information which may
be relevant to such Tax Return, audit, examination or proceeding, _provided_
that the foregoing shall be done in a manner so as not to interfere
unreasonably with the conduct of the business of the parties. Buyers shall
(and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) make available to Seller all
financial records of the Transferred Entities for the fiscal year during which
the Closing occurs and any prior fiscal year (the " _Fiscal Years_ ") to
enable Seller and its Affiliates to meet their obligations under applicable
Tax Law, _provided_ that such financial records shall be held by Seller and
its Affiliates as confidential except to the extent disclosure is necessary
for reporting under applicable Tax Law. Such financial records shall include:
(i) financial statements (to the extent such financial statements are required
by Law to be prepared); (ii) supporting trial balances; (iii) detailed loan
schedules showing movements in the balances of financial
arrangements (including external loan and intercompany loan balances); and
(iv) copies of Tax Returns, Tax assessments and confirmations of Tax payments
relating to each Fiscal Year, in each case, for some or all of the Transferred
Entities. Buyers shall provide all such financial records promptly upon
request by Seller.

Section 5.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _
1.3(e)_, all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in

Section 5.8 _Buyers_ __ _Covenant; Certain Post-Closing Actions_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from and
after the Closing, Buyers shall not, and shall not cause or permit any
Transferred Entity or any Affiliate of Buyer to: (i) take any action on the
Closing Date, but after the Closing, other than in the ordinary course of
business or as contemplated by this Agreement; or (ii) except as required by
Law, change any Tax election, file any Tax Return (except as provided in
_Section 5.4_) or make any Tax election inconsistent with past practice,
amend any Tax Return, initiate any voluntary disclosure with respect to Taxes,
or agree to waive or extend any statute of limitations for the assessment or
collection of any Tax, in each case without the prior written consent of
Seller and with respect to any matter that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of the Transferred Entities; provided, that Buyers shall be permitted
to make an election with respect to any Transferred Entity pursuant to Section
338(g) of the Code and shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and any of
its Affiliates from and against any liability for Taxes resulting therefrom.
If Buyers make any election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code as
permitted by this Section 

 



70  5.8, Buyers shall provide Seller with a copy of Form 8023 Election under
Section 338 for Corporations Making Qualified Stock Purchases as soon as it is
practicable following the filing of such form with the IRS.

(b) With respect to any Transferred Entity that is characterized as a
foreign corporation for U.S. federal income Tax purposes and for which the
Buyers do not make an election pursuant to Section 338(g) in compliance with
_Section 5.8(a)_ , from the Closing through the end of any taxable period of
such Transferred Entity that includes the Closing, Buyers shall not, and
shall cause their Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) not to:

 

(i) undertake any intercompany reorganization, merger, stock sale, asset
sale or other similar transaction outside the ordinary course of business
with respect to such Transferred Entities or

 

(ii) enter into any transaction or take any action outside the ordinary
course of business that:

 

(A) may be considered to constitute or result in the payment of an actual
or deemed dividend for U.S. federal income Tax purposes by such Transferred
Entity (including pursuant to Section 304 of the Code);

 

(B) could reasonably be expected to result in a diminution of foreign Tax
credits that, absent any such transaction or action, may be claimed by Seller
or any of its Affiliates;

(C) could result in the increase or diminution of any amount of earnings
and profits of any such Transferred Entity (other than an increase or
diminution attributable to ordinary business operations); or

 

(D) could give rise to subpart F income, within the meaning of Section 952
of the Code,

 

in each case without Sellers written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

Section 5.9 _Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. To the extent permitted
under applicable Tax Law, the parties agree to treat any indemnity payment
made under this _ARTICLE 5_ or _ARTICLE 8_ as an adjustment to the Final
Purchase Price for all federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes and the
parties agree to, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, file their
Tax Returns accordingly.

Section 5.10 _Miscellaneous_. Buyers shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any Affiliate (including any Transferred Entity) of any Buyer to, take
any action on the Closing Date after the Closing other than in the ordinary
course of business except: (a) as required by this Agreement or applicable
Law; (b) with Sellers consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); or (c) to the extent such action does not
increase any liabilities for Taxes in a Pre-Closing Tax Period. With respect
to the Transferred Entities, Buyers shall not make or change any election with
respect to Taxes that would reasonably be

 



71  expected to give rise to a Seller Tax indemnity obligation under _Section_
__ _ 5.1_ or reduce any Tax asset of Seller or any of its Affiliates.

 

Section 5.11 _PRC Taxes_. Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement
to the contrary, Seller shall provide the Buyers with Tax advice issued by a
reputable firm of tax practitioners and in form and substance acceptable to
Buyers confirming that no PRC Tax is payable under Bulletin 7 with respect to
the transactions contemplated hereby. Seller undertakes to fully indemnify
and hold harmless the Buyers and their Affiliates (and any of their respective
directors, officers and employees) against all PRC Taxes, interests and
penalties paid by, or other losses, costs and expenses (including attorney
fees) incurred by, Buyers and their Affiliates (and any of their respective
directors, officers and employees) arising out of the failure by Seller to
fully comply with Sellers obligations to pay PRC Taxes, or the Buyers or
their Affiliates refraining from making a voluntary filing under Bulletin 7 or
other applicable PRC Tax laws, or the Buyers and their Affiliates complying
with the proviso that immediately follows; _provided_ that, to the
extent permissible under applicable Laws, Buyers shall inform Seller
immediately after they (or any of their Affiliates) are contacted by the PRC
Tax authority regarding the transactions contemplated hereby and Buyers (and
their Affiliates) do not communicate any information regarding the
transactions contemplated hereby to the PRC Tax authority without prior
written consent of Seller. Sellers indemnification obligations under this
_Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall only terminate upon the expiration of the
corresponding statute of limitation under PRC Tax laws and regulations plus a
period of sixty (60) days, except in respect of any claim for which notice is
given to Seller before the relevant date of expiration.

Section 5.12 _Overlap_. To the extent of any inconsistency between this
_ARTICLE 5_ and  _ARTICLE 8_ , this _ARTICLE 5_ shall control as to Tax
matters.

prior to the Closing Date: 

(a) by the mutual written agreement of Buyers and Seller;

 

(b) by either Buyers or Seller by notice to the other party, if:

 

(i) the Closing shall not have been consummated on or before the close of

or  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, in the case of Buyers, to be satisfied by such

Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(b)(ii)(2)_, it shall have used
best efforts to remove such Order in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 4.3(c)_.

(c) by Buyers, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Seller set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause a condition set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.2(b)_ not to be satisfied, and
such breach is not cured or capable of being cured prior to the earlier of:
(i) the Business Day prior to the End Date; or (ii) the date that is thirty
(30) days from the date that Seller is notified in writing by Buyers of such
breach or failure to perform; _provided_ , that Buyers shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)_ if
any Buyer is then in material breach or violation of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement;

(d) by Seller, if a breach of any representation or warranty or failure to
perform any covenant or agreement on the part of Buyers set forth in this
Agreement shall have occurred that would cause a condition set forth in

such breach is not cured or capable of being cured prior to the earlier of:
(i) the Business Day prior to the End Date; or (ii) the date that is thirty

Section 7.2 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect without liability of any party (or any of its directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, Affiliates, agents, successors or assigns) to the
other party,  _provided_ that no such termination (nor any provision of this
Agreement) shall relieve any party from liability for any damages for fraud or
willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination (which, for the
avoidance of doubt, shall be deemed to include any failure by Buyers to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement if it is obligated
to do so hereunder). The provisions of _Section_ __ _ 4.2(c)_, _Section_ __ _
4.9(b)_, this _Section_ __ _ 7.2_, _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, _ARTICLE 10_ ,
_Section_ __ _ 11.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.4_ and the Confidentiality

Section 7.3 _Buyer Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event that Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to: (i) _Section
7.1(d)_ and a Financing Failure has occurred; or (ii) _Section 7.1(e)_ (a "
_Qualified Termination_ "), then Buyers shall promptly, but in no event later
than five (5) Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement,
pay by wire transfer of immediately available funds to accounts designated by
Seller, an amount in cash equal to $30,750,000 (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_
"), it being understood that in no event shall Buyers be required to pay the
Buyer Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(b) Buyers acknowledge and agree that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and that, without these agreements, Seller would not enter into
this Agreement. If Buyers fail to promptly pay the Buyer Termination Fee when
due, interest shall accrue on such amount from the date such payment was
required to be paid pursuant to the terms of this Agreement until the date of
payment at the Applicable Rate. If, in order to obtain such payment, Seller
commences a suit that results in judgment for such party for such amount, then
Buyers shall pay Seller its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) incurred in
connection with such suit. Each of the parties hereto further acknowledges
that the payment by Buyers of the Buyer Termination Fee is not a penalty, but
constitutes liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate
Seller in the circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts
and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this
Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the
event a Qualified Termination occurs and the Buyer Termination Fee is paid to
Seller, or as directed by Seller: (i) the payment of the Buyer Termination Fee
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(a)_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller and its Affiliates against Buyers and Silgan and their respective

 



77  Affiliates for any Losses suffered in connection with this Agreement
(including as a result of any breach of any covenant or agreement or other
provision in this Agreement) or the failure of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (or the Debt Financing) to be consummated (including under
_Section_ __ _ 4.9(b)_ hereof); (ii) upon payment of the Buyer Termination
Fee, none of Buyers and Silgan and their respective Affiliates nor the
Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates shall have any further
liability or obligation to Seller and its Affiliates relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the Debt Financing); and (iii) upon payment of the Buyer
Termination Fee, none of Seller and its Affiliates shall have any further
recourse against any of Buyers and Silgan and their respective Affiliates or
any of the Financing Sources and their respective Affiliates in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Debt Financing) and Seller shall cause any Litigation pending
against Buyers or Silgan or their respective Affiliates or any Financing
Source or its Affiliates in connection with this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Debt Financing) to
be dismissed with prejudice promptly, but in any event within five (5)
Business Days thereafter; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_ shall limit the right of Seller: (x) to bring or maintain any claim,
action or proceeding for injunction, specific performance or other equitable
relief against Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates to the extent
provided in _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, unless a Qualified Termination has occurred
and the Buyer Termination Fee has been paid in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 7.3(a)_; (y) to bring or maintain any claim, action or proceeding against
Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates arising out of a breach of the
Confidentiality Agreement; or (z) to be reimbursed by Buyers for any costs
and expenses pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_. For the avoidance of doubt,
in no event shall Seller or any of its Affiliates be entitled to receive both
monetary damages ( _i.e.,_ the Buyer Termination Fee) and specific
performance under this Agreement.

Section 7.4 _Limitation on Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement: (a) none of Seller and its Affiliates
shall have any rights or claims against any Financing Source in respect of any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the Debt
Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at Law or
in equity, whether in contract, in tort or otherwise; and (b) no Financing
Source shall have any liability (whether in contract, in tort or otherwise)
to Seller or any of its Affiliates for any obligations or liabilities of any
party or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the Debt
Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter, the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby or the performance thereof or the financing contemplated thereby
or in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any Litigation arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Financing Sources
are intended third-party beneficiaries of, and shall be entitled to the
protections of this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, _Sections 4.9_ , _7.3_ , _11.2_ ,
_11.4_ , _11.5_ , _11.7_ ,  _11.9(c)_ and _11.10_ , in each case, with
respect to their respective rights hereunder and thereunder. For the avoidance
of any doubt, this _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ does not alter, modify, supplement or
change, in any respect, the rights and obligations of the Financing Sources
set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter to Buyers.

Indemnification Deductible. Any such individual claims or group of related

Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall the aggregate monetary
obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement exceed the Final Purchase Price.

 

(d) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder (but not for purposes of
establishing whether a breach has occurred), any materiality or Material
Adverse Effect qualifications in the representations and warranties in
_ARTICLE 2_ shall be disregarded (other than in the definition of "Material
Contract," _Section_ __ _ 2.6_,  _Section_ __ _ 2.8(a)(i)_, _Section_ __ _
2.9_, _Section_ __ _ 2.16(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 2.20_, _Section_ __ _ 2.21_
and  _Section_ __ _ 2.22(b)_, each of which shall retain such qualifications
for all purposes).

 

Section 8.3 _Indemnification by Buyers_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to this _ARTICLE 8_ , Buyers,
jointly and severally, shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and
each of its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees and
agents (collectively, the " _Seller Indemnitees_ ") from and against, and pay
or reimburse the Seller Indemnitees for, any and all Losses to the extent
resulting from: (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
Buyers in _ARTICLE 3_ ; or (ii) any breach in performance by Buyers of any of
their respective covenants or agreements contained herein. Seller Indemnitees
shall not be entitled to recover under _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)(i)_ for an
individual claim or group of related claims unless and until the amount of
Losses that otherwise would be payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)(i)_ with respect to such claim or group of related claims exceeds the
Per Claim Threshold, _provided_ , _further_ , that no claims by Seller
Indemnitees shall be asserted under  _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)(i)_ unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses that would otherwise be payable hereunder
exceeds on a cumulative basis the Indemnification Deductible, and then only to
the extent such Losses exceed the Indemnification Deductible. Any such
individual claims or group of related claims for the amounts less than the Per
Claim Threshold shall be ignored in determining whether the Indemnification
Deductible has been exceeded. The Per Claim Threshold and the Indemnification
Deductible shall not apply with respect to any: (i) claims for indemnification
for any breach of a Fundamental Representation; or (ii) claims with respect to
any Buyers actual and intentional fraud with respect to any express
provisions in this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth above in  _Section_ __ _
8.3(a)_, Buyers shall not be liable for indemnification for any claims made
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.3(a)(i)_ in excess of $102,500,000.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the limitations in
_Section_ __ _ 8.3(b)_ shall not apply with respect to any: (i) claims for
indemnification for any breach of a Fundamental Representation; or (ii) claims
with respect to any Buyers actual and intentional fraud with respect to any
express provisions in this Agreement; _provided, however_ , in no event shall
the aggregate monetary obligations of Buyers or any of their respective
Affiliates in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
exceed the Final Purchase Price.

 



80 (d) For purposes of calculating Losses hereunder (but not for purposes
of establishing whether a breach has occurred), any materiality
qualifications in the representations and warranties in _ARTICLE 3_ shall be
disregarded.

 

Section 8.4 _Limitations on Indemnity_. Buyers and Seller agree, for
themselves and on behalf of Buyer Indemnitees and Seller Indemnitees:

(a) The amount of any and all Losses indemnifiable pursuant to  _Section_
__ _ 5.1_ or _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall be determined net of: (i) any amounts
actually recovered by Buyer Indemnitees under insurance policies (other than
the RandW Insurance Policy) or other collateral sources (such as contractual
indemnities of any Person which are contained outside of this Agreement) with
respect to such Losses, in each case, net of costs of collection and any
increase to premiums directly resulting from making any claim thereunder; and
(ii) any Tax benefits actually realized by Buyer Indemnitees with respect to
such Losses in the year of the Loss or the immediately-succeeding Tax year. In
any case where a Buyer Indemnitee realizes Tax benefits or recovers, under
insurance policies (other than the RandW Insurance Policy except as provided in
the last sentence of this _Section 8.4(a)_ ) or from other collateral sources,
any amount in respect of a matter for which such Buyer Indemnitee was
indemnified pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, in each case to the extent not
already taken into account pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.4(a)_, such
Buyer Indemnitee shall promptly pay over to Seller the amount so recovered
(net of costs of recovery (including deductibles) and any increases in
premiums resulting from procuring such recovery), to the extent of any amount
previously so paid by Seller or on behalf of Seller to or on behalf of
such Buyer Indemnitee in respect of such matter. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event of any Losses under _Section_ __ _ 8.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ ,
any claim in respect of such Losses (a " _Covered Claim_ ") shall be made by
the applicable Buyer Indemnitees concurrently against the RandW Insurance Policy
and Seller and, to the extent such Losses would reasonably be expected to be
covered by such RandW Insurance Policy, such Buyer Indemnitees shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to first seek recovery under the RandW
Insurance Policy before seeking recovery against Seller, and, if applicable,
Buyers shall continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to pursue
recovery under the RandW Insurance Policy for a Covered Claim (to the extent
such Losses are reasonably expected to be covered by the RandW Insurance Policy)
following the payment of all or part of such Covered Claim by Seller. In the
event that any Buyer recovers under the RandW Insurance Policy any amount in
respect of a Covered Claim for which such Buyer Indemnitee was indemnified
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ by Seller, such Buyer Indemnitee shall
promptly pay over to Seller the amount so recovered under the RandW Insurance
Policy, to the extent of any amount previously so indemnified by Seller.

 

(b) Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 5.1_ or  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ for any portion of Losses: (i)
for which the Financial Statements recorded a reserve; (ii) that was taken
into account on a dollar-for-dollar basis (or, if less than on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, to the extent so taken into account) in the Final Purchase
Price as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3(c)_; (iii) to the
extent that the Buyer Indemnitees failed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate or prevent such Losses that are reasonably known by the
Buyer Indemnitees; (iv) to the extent that such Losses resulted from an action
or inaction of any Buyer Indemnitee after the Closing that exacerbated the
circumstances giving rise to such otherwise indemnifiable Loss, _provided_
that such circumstances giving rise to such otherwise indemnifiable Loss were
reasonably known by the Buyer Indemnitees; or (v) that relates to

 



81  Taxes arising in a Post-Closing Tax Period except to the extent such Loss
results from a breach of or inaccuracy in a Post-Closing Tax Representation.

 

(c) If an Indemnifying Party makes an indemnification payment to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss, then such Indemnifying Party will
be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to all related rights and
remedies of such Indemnified Party under any insurance policy (other than the
RandW Insurance Policy) or otherwise against or with respect to such Loss,
except with respect to amounts relating to such Loss that have not yet been
recovered by such Indemnified Party (or any other such Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder). If any portion of any Loss to be reimbursed by the
Indemnifying Party may be covered, in whole or in part, by third-party
insurance coverage (other than the RandW Insurance Policy) or otherwise, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice thereof to the Indemnifying
Party. Promptly following such Indemnifying Partys request, such Indemnified
Party will take all reasonably necessary, proper or desirable actions
(including the execution and delivery of any document reasonably requested) to
accomplish the foregoing.

 

(d) In no event shall an Indemnifying Party have liability to the
Indemnified Party for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or
punitive damages, loss of business reputation, lost profits, damages based on
multiple of earnings (except that the foregoing limitation on damages based on
multiple of earnings shall not apply to damages that result from a breach by
Seller of the representations and warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _
2.6(a)_) or exemplary damages, except if and to the extent any such damages
are recovered against an Indemnified Party pursuant to a Third-Party Claim.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller
shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless Buyer Indemnitees with
respect to any environmental matter to the extent: (i) such matter arises out
of any investigation of environmental conditions, including sampling or
testing or any disclosure to any Governmental Authority, undertaken by or on
behalf of Buyer Indemnitees, unless such investigation or disclosure was
required under applicable Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits, or
unless such investigation was directed by a Governmental Authority; (ii)
Buyer Indemnitees are not required by applicable Environmental Laws to take
Remedial Action with respect to such matter; (iii) Buyer Indemnitees: (1)
remediate environmental conditions in excess of industrial standards or
other applicable minimum standards, including risk-based standards,
commercially reasonable engineering and institutional controls or deed or
other restrictions; (2) incur costs in excess of the Minimum Reasonable Cost;
or (3) exacerbate, or fail to use commercially reasonable efforts to
mitigate, any environmental condition existing as of the Closing Date; (iv)
such Losses arise from changes in an Environmental Law or an Environmental
Permit occurring after the Closing Date; or (v) such Losses arise from any
material change in the use of any of the facilities used by the Transferred
Entities in the operation of the Business as of the Closing Date from their
use as of immediately prior to the Closing. In connection with any sale of a
facility by a Transferred Entity: (x) the applicable Buyer shall use, and
shall cause the Transferred Entities to use, commercially reasonable efforts
to include in any agreement for such sale an agreement by the
applicable buyer of such facility to the applicable Transferred Entity
substantially the same as the provisions in _Section 8.4(e)(_ _i_ _)_ , _(ii)_
, _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and _(v)_ (but, as to clause (v) only to the extent
the change in use of the facility is a change from industrial use); and (y)
Seller shall not be required to indemnify or hold harmless the Buyer
Indemnitees for any

 



82  indemnification claim made on or after the date of such sale of such
facility with respect to any environmental matter for such facility if the
buyer of such facility did not so agree to substantially the same provisions
in _Section 8.4(e)(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , _(iv)_ and _(v)_ (but, as to
clause (v) only to the extent the change in use of the facility is a change
from industrial use).

 

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Seller
shall have the option to control any claim for indemnification relating to
environmental matters asserted by the Buyer Indemnitees, including the
disclosure, investigation, remediation, monitoring, negotiation, performance,
settlement and resolution of any such matter and any other Remedial Action
taken in connection therewith, _provided_ that with respect to any such claim,
Seller shall not negotiate a final settlement or resolution of any such claim
without Buyers prior written consent, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld, and Seller shall keep Buyers reasonably informed of
any such matter. Seller shall be deemed to have fully satisfied its
indemnification obligations hereunder with respect to such matter if the
Remedial Action taken by Seller satisfies the Minimum Reasonable Cost and has
been completed to the satisfaction of the applicable Governmental Authority as
evidenced by a "no further action" letter or its substantial equivalent, if
applicable. If Seller opts to have Buyers control any claim for
indemnification arising under Environmental Laws, then Buyers shall keep
Seller reasonably informed of any such matter.

 

(g) Seller shall not be liable under this _ARTICLE 8_ for any Losses based
upon or arising out of any inaccuracy or breach of any of the representations
or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement to the extent that Seller
can demonstrate that any Buyer had actual knowledge of such inaccuracy or
breach prior to the date hereof and that such actual knowledge was obtained
through information disclosed: (i) in writing by Seller in the Merrill
Corporation electronic data room entitled "Project Oak" prior to the date
hereof; or (ii) to Buyers by Seller or its representatives in writing (or
solely with respect to the certain Contracts, documents or information set
forth in _Section 2.9(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter that contain a
footnote stating "oral summary provided on January 11 and 17, 2017" and the
oral summaries regarding the two internal environmental compliance audits
pertaining to Valhinos, Brazil and Wuxi, China as referred to on _Section
2.14(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter, through oral summaries provided by
Seller to Buyers (which oral summaries have been provided to Buyers in lieu
of written documentation)) prior to the date hereof in response to Buyers due
diligence inquiries and other questions.

 

(h) Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement.

 

Section 8.5 _Notification of Claims; Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this Agreement
(the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party or parties
liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this _ARTICLE 8_ ,
describing in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to
the subject matter of such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that the failure to
provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying Party from any of its
obligations under this _ARTICLE 8_  

 



83  except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such
failure. The parties agree that: (i) notices for claims in respect of a breach
of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement must be delivered prior
to the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in _Section_ __
_ 8.1_ for such representation, warranty, covenant or agreement; and (ii) any
claims for indemnification for which notice is not timely delivered in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall be expressly barred and are
hereby waived, _provided_ that if, prior to such applicable date, a party
shall have notified any other party in accordance with the requirements of
this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ of a claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE
8_ (whether or not formal legal action shall have been commenced based upon
such claim), then such claim shall continue to be subject to indemnification
in accordance with this _ARTICLE 8_ notwithstanding the passing of such
applicable date.

 

(b) Upon receipt of notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified
Party pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ in respect of a pending or
threatened claim or demand by a third party that the Indemnified Party has
determined has given or could reasonably give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement (such claim or demand being a " _Third-
Party Claim_ " and including, without limitation, a pending or threatened
claim or demand asserted by a third party against the Indemnified Party), the
Indemnifying Party may, by notice to the Indemnified Party delivered within
twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt of notice of such Third-Party Claim
acknowledging that the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify and defend
(and agrees to indemnify) the Indemnified Party in full in connection with
such Third-Party Claim, assume the defense and control of such Third-Party
Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. In the event that the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_, the Indemnified Party shall reasonably in good
faith cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in connection therewith,
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party shall provide periodic updates
and information to the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall
allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the
defense of such Third-Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense.
So long as the Indemnifying Party is reasonably contesting any such Third-
Party Claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any
such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense
and settlement of a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Party shall have
the right to pay or settle such Third-Party Claim; _provided_ that in such
event it shall waive any right to indemnity by the Indemnifying Party for all
Losses related to such Third-Party Claim unless the Indemnifying Party shall
have consented in writing to such payment or settlement. If the Indemnifying
Party does not notify the Indemnified Party within twenty (20) Business Days
after the receipt of the Indemnified Partys notice of a claim hereunder that
it elects to undertake the defense thereof, then the Indemnified Party shall
have the right to contest, settle or compromise the claim and the taking of
any such actions shall not thereby be deemed to be a waiver of any right to
indemnity therefor pursuant to this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall
not, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any
settlement or consent to entry of any judgment (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the absence as a term thereof the giving by the Person(s) asserting such claim
to all Indemnified Parties of a release from all liability with respect to
such claim shall not be deemed an unreasonable basis for withholding consent
to any such settlement or consent to entry of a judgment).

 



84 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume control of the defense of
a Third-Party Claim (unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Indemnified
Party) and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by
the Indemnified Party if: (i) such Third-Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with any criminal or quasi-criminal proceeding, action, indictment,
allegation or investigation; (ii) such Third-Party Claim seeks an injunction
or equitable relief against the Indemnified Party that the Indemnified Party
reasonably determines, upon advice of outside counsel, cannot be separated
from any related claim for money damages (and, if such equitable relief of
such Third-Party Claim can be so separated from that for money damages, then
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume control of the defense of
that portion relating to money damages); (iii) the Indemnifying Party fails to
acknowledge its obligations to indemnify and defend the Indemnified Party in
full against the Third-Party Claim, or fails to agree to indemnify the
Indemnified Party against such Third-Party Claim and undertake the defense of
such Third-Party Claim, within the twenty (20)-Business Day time period
referred to above in _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_; (iv) the Indemnified Party has
been advised in writing by counsel that a reasonable likelihood exists of a
conflict of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party;
or (v) upon petition by the Indemnified Party, the appropriate court rules
that the Indemnifying Party failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or
defend such Third-Party Claim.

 

(d) All of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution
of any Third-Party Claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought
hereunder and each Buyer and Seller (or a duly authorized representative of
such party) shall (and shall cause the Transferred Entities to) furnish such
records, information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery
proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals, as may be reasonably requested in
connection therewith.

 

(e) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives notice of a claim for
indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_
that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify
the Indemnified Party within forty-five (45) days following its receipt of
such notice whether the Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _ARTICLE 8_. The Indemnified Party shall provide
such information to the Indemnifying Party as is reasonably necessary to
determine the validity of any such claim for indemnity by the Indemnified
Party.

Section 8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement and except: (a) with respect to the matters covered by
_Section_ __ _ 1.3_ and _Section_ __ _ 7.3_; (b) in the case where a party
seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_; or
(c) in the case of actual and intentional fraud with respect to any express
provisions of this Agreement, Seller and Buyers hereby agree that following
the Closing, the sole and exclusive remedy of a party for any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement shall be the applicable indemnification rights set forth in
this _ARTICLE 8_ or _ARTICLE 5_ ,  _Section_ __ _ 4.4(f)_, _Section_ __ _
4.4(n)(ii)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.4(t)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.6_, _Section_ __ _
4.9(b)_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.11(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.12_, _Section_ __ _
4.16(d)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.23_, _Section_ __ _ 4.24_, _Section_ __ _
4.25_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.26_, _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ and _Section_ __ _
11.3_. In furtherance of the foregoing, except with respect to the matters
covered by _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, and subject to _Section_ __ _ 11.9_ and the
indemnification rights set forth in this _ARTICLE 8_ or _ARTICLE 5_ ,
_Section_ __ _ 4.4(f)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.4(n)(ii)_, 

 



85   _Section_ __ _ 4.4(t)_, _Section_ __ _ 4.6_, _Section_ __ _ 4.9(b)_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.11(d)_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.12_, _Section_ __ _ 4.16(d)_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.23_, _Section_ __ _ 4.24_, _Section_ __ _ 4.25_, _Section_
__ _ 4.26_,  _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ and _Section_ __ _ 11.3_: (i) Buyers
hereby waive and release, from and after the Closing Date, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action any Buyer Indemnitee may have against Seller or
any of its respective Affiliates or their respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, controlling Persons, agents or representatives,
successors or assigns; and (ii) Seller (on behalf of itself and each of the
other Selling Entities) hereby waives and releases, from and after the
Closing Date, any and all rights, claims and causes of action any Seller
Indemnitee may have against Buyers or any of their respective Affiliates or
their respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents or
representatives, successors or assigns, in either case with regard to the
matters covered by this Agreement, to the extent such rights, claims and
causes of action arise under or are based upon any applicable Law. 

Section 8.7 _Exchange Rate_. For purposes of applying any dollars
denominated threshold amounts or limitations on indemnification to Losses
denominated in a currency other than dollars, the amounts of such Losses shall
be converted into dollars using an exchange rate equal to average of the
prevailing exchange rate for transactions as published by _The Wall Street
Journal_ published on each of the five (5) consecutive Business Days
immediately preceding the date on which the indemnification payment for such
Loss is made.

 

Section 8.8 _Exercise of Remedies by Persons Other than the Parties_. No
Buyer Indemnitee (other than Buyers or any successor or permitted assignee of
any Buyer) is entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this
Agreement unless Buyers (or any successor or permitted assignee of any Buyer)
consent to the assertion of the indemnification claim. No Seller Indemnitee
(other than Seller or any successor or permitted assignee of Seller) is
entitled to assert any indemnification claim under this Agreement unless
Seller (or any successor or permitted assignee of Seller) consents to the
assertion of the indemnification claim.

China.

 

Section 10.2 _Interpretation and Construction_. The parties have
participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In
the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Unless
otherwise provided herein, all monetary values stated herein are expressed in
United States currency and all references to "dollars" or "$" will be deemed
references to the lawful money of the United States. The words "hereof,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of like import used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of
this Agreement. The words "party" or "parties" shall refer to parties to this
Agreement. The captions herein are included for convenience of reference only
and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof. References
to Articles, Sections and Exhibits are to Articles, Sections and Exhibits of
this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Any capitalized term used in any
Exhibit or the Seller Disclosure Letter but not otherwise defined therein
shall have the meaning given to such term in this Agreement. Any singular term
in this Agreement shall be deemed to include the plural, and any plural term
the singular. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation," whether or not they are in fact followed by those words
or words of like import. The word "or"

 



109  when used in this Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the
phrase "to the extent" means the degree to which a subject or other thing
extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if." The word "will" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall." "Writing,"
"written" and comparable terms refer to printing, typing and other means of
reproducing words (including electronic media) in a visible form. References
to any agreement or contract are to that agreement or contract as amended,
modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof
and thereof. References to any Person include the successors and permitted
assigns of that Person. References from or through any date mean, unless
otherwise specified, from and including or through and including,
respectively. References to any statute shall be deemed to refer to such
statute as amended from time to time and to any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder ( _provided_ that for purposes of any representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement that are made as of a
specific date or dates, references to any statute shall be deemed to refer to
such statute, as amended, and to any rules or regulations promulgated
thereunder, in each case, as of such date). Any reference to "days" means
calendar days unless Business Days are expressly specified. If any action
under this Agreement is required to be done or taken on a day that is not a
Business Day, then such action shall be required to be done or taken not on
such day but on the first succeeding Business Day thereafter. If the Closing
shall occur, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any
payment obligation of Buyers hereunder shall be a joint and several obligation
of Buyers and the Transferred Entities and Buyers shall cause the Transferred
Entities to comply with this obligation.

Section 11.2 _Amendment; Waivers, Etc_. No amendment, modification or
discharge of this Agreement, and no waiver hereunder, shall be valid or
binding unless set forth in writing and duly executed by the party against
whom enforcement of the amendment, modification, discharge or waiver is
sought. Any such waiver shall constitute a waiver only with respect to the
specific matter described in such writing and shall in no way impair the
rights of the party granting such waiver in any other respect or at any other
time. Neither the waiver by any of the parties hereto of a breach of or a
default under any of the provisions of this Agreement, nor the failure by any
of the parties, on one or more occasions, to enforce any of the provisions of
this Agreement or to exercise any right or privilege hereunder, shall be
construed as a waiver of any other breach or default of a similar nature, or

provided are cumulative and none is exclusive of any other, or of any rights
or remedies that any party may otherwise have at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, _Section_ __ _
7.4_, _Section_ __ _ 4.9_,  _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, this _Section_ __ _
11.2_, _Section_ __ _ 11.4_, _Section_ __ _ 11.5_, _Section_ __ _ 11.7_,
_Section_ __ _ 11.9(c)_ and  _Section_ __ _ 11.10_ (and any provision of
this Agreement to the extent an amendment, modification, discharge or waiver
of such provision would modify the substance of any of the foregoing
provisions) may not be amended, modified, 

 



111  discharged or waived in a manner that impacts or is adverse in any respect
to any Financing Source without the prior written consent of such Financing
Source.

 

Section 11.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement,
whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid
by the party hereto incurring such fees or expenses. Without limiting the
foregoing, in the event that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are consummated, Seller shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all Transaction
Expenses and shall promptly reimburse or indemnify fully the Buyer Indemnitees
for all Transaction Expenses that have not been paid.

 

Section 11.4 _Governing Law, Etc_.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed in all respects, including as to
validity, interpretation and effect, by the Laws of the State of Delaware,
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws. Each of
the parties hereto submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware located in Wilmington, Delaware (or, if
such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, the federal courts of the United States of America located in the
City of Wilmington in the State of Delaware), in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that all claims under
any theory of liability in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement in any other court.
Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Each party hereto agrees that service of summons and complaint or any
other process that might be served in any action or proceeding may be made on
such party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to the party to
be served at the address of the party and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section_ __ _ 11.1_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _
11.4_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in
any other manner permitted by Law. Each party hereto agrees that a final, non-
appealable judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive
and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by Law.

(b) The parties to this Agreement each hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law, any right to trial by jury of any claim, demand,
action or cause of action: (i) arising under this Agreement; or (ii) in any
way connected with or related or incidental to the dealings of the parties
hereto in respect of this Agreement or any of the transactions related
hereto, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in
contract, tort, equity, or otherwise. The parties to this Agreement each
hereby agrees and consents that any such claim, demand, action or cause of
action shall be decided by court trial without a jury and that the parties to
this Agreement may file an original counterpart of a copy of this Agreement
with any court as written evidence of the consent of the parties hereto to
the waiver of their right to trial by jury.

 



112 Section 11.5 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective heirs, successors and permitted assigns; _provided_ that this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements shall not be assigned by any
party hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior
written consent of Buyers and Seller; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyers
(and their permitted assigns) may at any time without the prior written
consent of Seller: (a) designate any other direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiaries of Silgan to have the right to purchase any of the Shares as a
"Buyer" hereunder; or (b) assign, in whole or in part, their rights and
obligations under this Agreement to one or more of its Affiliates or to any
subsequent purchaser of the Transferred Entities or of any material portion of
any of their respective assets. Any attempted assignment of this Agreement not
in accordance with the terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 11.5_ shall be void.

Section 11.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Seller Disclosure
Letter, the Ancillary Agreements (when executed and delivered) and the
Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement of the parties with
respect to the matters covered hereby and thereby and supersede all
prior agreements, understandings and representations, both written and oral,
between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 

Section 11.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this
Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, all other provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon any such determination, the parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of
the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 

Section 11.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in several
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
shall together constitute one and the same instrument. Delivery of an executed
counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile or other
electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed
counterpart to this Agreement.

Section 11.9 _Specific Performance_.

 

(a) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision
of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any court specified in  _Section_ __ _ 11.4_,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. The parties hereby agree not to assert, and hereby waive, in any
action seeking injunctive relief or for specific performance, the defense of
adequacy of a remedy at law and the posting of any bond or other security in
connection therewith.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 11.9(a)_, it is agreed that Seller shall be entitled to
specific performance of Buyers obligation to cause Buyers to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby (including to

 



113  effect the Closing in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement), only in the event
that: (i) Buyers are required to complete the Closing pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.2_ (disregarding for this purpose any conditions in _ARTICLE 6_ that
have not been satisfied as a result of any Buyers breach of this Agreement);
(ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or will be funded by the date the
Closing is required to have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_
(disregarding for this purpose any conditions in _ARTICLE 6_ that have not
been satisfied as a result of any Buyers breach of this Agreement); (iii)
any Buyer fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to
have occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_ (disregarding for this purpose
any conditions in _ARTICLE 6_ that have not been satisfied as a result of
such Buyers breach of this Agreement); and (iv) Seller has irrevocably
confirmed that, if specific performance is granted and the Debt Financing is
funded, then the Closing will occur. The parties have specifically bargained
for the right to specific performance of the obligations hereunder in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this _Section_ __ _ 11.9_,
notwithstanding the potential for payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in the
event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section_ __ _
7.3_.

 

(c) Each party further agrees that: (i) by seeking the remedies provided
for in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_, a party hereto shall not in any respect
waive its right to seek any other form of relief that may be available to such
party under this Agreement or in the event that the remedies provided for in
this  _Section_ __ _ 11.9_ are not available or otherwise are not granted;
and (ii) nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.9_ shall require any
party hereto to institute any action for (or limit any partys right to
institute any action for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _
11.9_ prior or as a condition to exercising any termination right under
_ARTICLE 7_ , nor shall the commencement of any action pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.9_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.9_
restrict or limit any such partys right to terminate this Agreement in
accordance with _ARTICLE 7_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement
that may be available then or thereafter. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall Seller be entitled to, or be
permitted to seek, specific performance in respect of any Financing Source.

Section 11.10 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of each party and its successors and
permitted assigns and, except for _Section_ __ _ 4.4_, _Section_ __ _ 4.6_,
_Section_ __ _ 4.9(b)_ and _ARTICLE 8_ (each of which shall be for the
benefit of the Persons set forth therein, and each such Person shall be an
intended third-party beneficiary thereof and shall have the rights, benefits
and remedies provided for therein), and except as provided in  _Section_ __ _
7.4_, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

 

Section 11.11 _No Other Representations and Warranties of Seller_. Except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _ARTICLE 2_ ,
neither Seller nor any Transferred Entity nor any of their respective agents,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or representatives nor any other
Person makes or shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty to
Buyers, express or implied, at law or in equity, on behalf of Seller, a
Transferred Entity or any Affiliate of Seller or of a Transferred Entity, and
each of Seller, the Transferred Entities and each of their
respective Affiliates by this Agreement disclaims any such representation or
warranty (including any representation or warranty as to merchantability,
suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or quality), whether by
Seller, a Transferred Entity 

 



114  or any of their respective agents, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees or representatives or any other Person, notwithstanding the delivery
or disclosure to any Buyer or any of its officers, directors, employees,
agents or representatives or any other Person of any documentation or other
information by a Seller, a Transferred Entity or any of their respective
agents, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or representatives or any
other Person with respect to any one or more of the foregoing.

Section 11.12 _No Other Representations and Warranties of Buyers_. Except
for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in _ARTICLE 3_ ,
neither any Buyer nor any of its agents, Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees or representatives nor any other Person makes or shall be deemed to
make any representation or warranty to Seller or WestRock, express or implied,
at law or in equity, on behalf of Buyers or any Affiliate of Buyers, and each
Buyer and its Affiliates by this Agreement disclaims any such representation
or warranty (including any representation or warranty as to merchantability,
suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or quality), whether by such
Buyer or any of its agents, Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or
representatives or any other Person, notwithstanding the delivery or
disclosure to Seller and WestRock or any of its officers, directors,
employees, agents or representatives or any other Person of any documentation
or other information by a Buyer or any of its agents, Affiliates, officers,
directors, employees or representatives or any other Person with respect to
any one or more of the foregoing.

 

Section 11.13 _No Additional Representations; Inspection_. Each Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that it has conducted its own independent
investigation and analysis as it has deemed necessary or desirable of, and,
based thereon, has formed an independent judgment concerning, the Business,
assets, condition, operations and prospects of the Transferred Entities. In
connection with each Buyers investigation, each Buyer has received from
Seller or its Affiliates various forward-looking statements regarding the
Business and the Transferred Entities (including the estimates,
assumptions, projections, forecasts, plans or budgets of future revenues,
expenses or expenditures, future results of operations (or any component
thereof), future cash flows (or any component thereof) or future financial
condition (or any component thereof) of the Business and the Transferred
Entities furnished to Buyers or any of its respective agents, representatives,
lenders or Affiliates) (the " _Forward-Looking Statements_ "). Each Buyer
acknowledges and agrees: (a) there are uncertainties inherent in attempting
to make the Forward-Looking Statements; (b) such Buyer is familiar with such
uncertainties; and (c) such Buyer is not relying on any Forward-Looking
Statement in any manner whatsoever. In entering into this Agreement, such
Buyer has relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis and the
representations and warranties set forth in _ARTICLE 2_ , and such Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, except for the representations and warranties
set forth in _ARTICLE 2_ : (a) neither Seller nor any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents or
representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty, either
express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to Buyers or any of its respective
agents, representatives, lenders or Affiliates prior to the execution of this
Agreement; and (b) it has not been induced by or relied upon in any manner
whatsoever any representation, warranty or other statement, express or
implied, made by Seller or any of its respective directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates, stockholders, agents or representatives or any
other Person. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that neither Seller nor any of its respective
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates,

 



115  stockholders, agents or representatives makes or has made any representation
or warranty, either express or implied: (a) with respect to any Forward-
Looking Statements made: (i) in any management presentations; (ii) in any
"data room"; (iii) in any supplemental due diligence information provided or
made available; (iv) in connection with such Buyers discussions with
management of the Business; (v) in negotiations leading to this Agreement; or
(vi) in any other circumstance; (b) with respect to the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying any Forward-Looking Statements; or (c) as to
merchantability, suitability or fitness for a particular purpose or quality,
with respect to any tangible assets or as to the condition or workmanship
thereof or the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or patent. Each
Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the representations and warranties set
forth in _ARTICLE_ __ _ 2_ are in lieu of, and such Buyer hereby expressly
waives all rights to, any implied warranties that may otherwise be applicable
because of the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code or any other Law,
including the warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
purpose.

 

Section 11.14 _Representation of the Transferred Entities and Seller_.
Each Buyer and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing, the
Transferred Entities) hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, shareholders, members, partners, officers, employees and
Affiliates, that, in the event that a dispute arises after the
Closing arising from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement between
any Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller or any of its
respective directors, shareholders, members, partners, officers, employees or
Affiliates (any of the foregoing, a " _Sell-Side Party_ "), on the other
hand, Rogers and Hardin LP (" _R andH_") or Eversheds LLP (" _Eversheds_ ") may
represent the Sell-Side Party in such dispute even though the interests of
the Sell-Side Party may be directly adverse to a Buyer or a Transferred
Entity, and even though RandH or Eversheds may have represented a Transferred
Entity in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling
ongoing matters for a Transferred Entity. Each Buyer further agrees that, as
to all communications among RandH or Eversheds, a Transferred Entity and the
Sell-Side Parties that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs to Seller (on behalf of the Sell-Side Parties) and may be
controlled by Seller and shall not pass to or be claimed by any Buyer or any
of the Transferred Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
a dispute arises between any Buyer or any of the Transferred Entities and a
third party other than a Sell-Side Party after the Closing, a Transferred
Entity may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of
confidential communications by RandH or Eversheds to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no Transferred Entity may waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of Seller.

 

Section 11.15 _Exhibits and Schedules_. The Seller Disclosure Letter and
all exhibits or other documents expressly incorporated into this Agreement,
are hereby incorporated into this Agreement and are hereby made a part hereof
as if set out in full in this Agreement. Without limiting the terms of the
Seller Disclosure Letter, any item disclosed in the Seller Disclosure Letter
referenced by a particular section in this Agreement shall be deemed to have
been disclosed with respect to every other section in this Agreement if the
relevance of such disclosure to such other section is reasonably apparent.
The specification of any dollar amount in the representations or warranties
contained in this Agreement or the inclusion of any specific item in the
Seller Disclosure Letter is not intended to imply that such amounts, or higher
or lower amounts or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no party shall use the fact of the setting of such amounts or
the inclusion of any such item in any dispute or

 



116  controversy as to whether any obligation, items or matter not described
herein or included in the Seller Disclosure Letter is or is not material for
purposes of this Agreement. The Seller Disclosure Letter and the information
and statements contained therein are not intended to constitute, and shall not
be construed as constituting, representations or warranties of Seller except
as, or to the extent, provided in this Agreement.

 



117 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have duly executed this Agreement as of the
date first above written.
