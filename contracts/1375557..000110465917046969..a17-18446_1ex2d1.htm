 **AGREEMENT**

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, premises, representations
and warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties to this Agreement
agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE 1 
THE OFFER**

 



 

1.1 _The Offer_.

 



 

(a) _Terms and Conditions_. Provided that this Agreement shall not have been
terminated in accordance with _Article 7_, as promptly as practicable after
the date hereof (but in no event later than ten (10) Business Days after the
date hereof), Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) commence,
within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act, the Offer to purchase
for cash any and all outstanding Company Shares at the Offer Price (subject to
_Section 2.4_). The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the
" _Offer to Purchase_ ") that contains the terms and conditions of the Offer
as set forth in this Agreement and in _Annex I_ (the " _Offer Conditions_ ").
The consummation of the Offer, and the obligation of Purchaser to accept for
payment and pay for Company Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be
subject only to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and to the
satisfaction, or waiver by Purchaser, of the Offer Conditions.

 



 

(b) _Waiver of Conditions_. To the extent permitted by Law, Purchaser
expressly reserves the right (in its sole discretion) to waive any of the
conditions to the Offer, and to increase the Offer Price or to make any other
changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that except with the prior written approval of the Company (in its sole
discretion), Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of
Company Shares sought to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend, modify or
waive the Minimum Condition, (v) impose conditions to the Offer that are in
addition to the conditions to the Offer set forth in _Annex I_ hereto, (vi)
except as provided in _Section 1.1(c)_ or _Section 1.1(d)_, terminate,
accelerate, extend or otherwise modify or amend the Expiration Date, or (vii)
otherwise modify or amend any of the Offer Conditions or other terms of the
Offer in a manner adverse, or that would reasonably be expected to be adverse,
to the holders of Company Shares. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event
shall any waiver by Parent or Purchaser of any condition to the Offer (other
than the Minimum Condition) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement be
deemed to be a modification or amendment of the Offer that is adverse to the
holders of Company Shares.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. Unless extended in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer shall expire at 12:00 midnight
(Eastern time) on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days following the
commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) promulgated under
the Exchange Act) (such date and time, the " _Initial Expiration Date_ "). In
the event that the Offer is extended pursuant to and in accordance with this
Agreement, then the Offer shall expire on the date and at the time to which
the Offer has been so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later
date and time to which the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Purchaser may
extend the Expiration Date at any time with the Companys written consent.
Purchaser may, without the Companys consent:

 



 

(i) extend the Offer for any period required by any Law or rules, regulations,
interpretations or positions of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ ") or its staff or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer (including in
order to comply with Exchange Act Rule 14e-1(b) in respect of any change in
the Offer Price); or

 



 

(ii) if, as of any Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and
has not been waived, extend the Offer on one or more occasions in consecutive
increments of up to ten (10) Business Days each (or such longer period as the
parties hereto may agree), until such time as all Offer Conditions are
satified or waived;

 



 

 _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the Companys written consent,
Purchaser shall not extend the Offer beyond the earlier of the End Date and
the termination of this Agreement. If, (A) as of any Expiration Date, any
Offer Condition (other than the Minimum Condition) is not satisfied and has
not been waived by Purchaser in its sole discretion or (B) as of any
Expiration Date, all Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived by
Purchaser in its sole discretion other than the Minimum Condition, then on
every occasion under clause (A) and on not more than two (2) occasions under
clause (B), in each case at the request of the Company, Purchaser shall extend
the Offer for an additional period of ten (10) Business Days (or such longer
or shorter period as the parties hereto may agree) to permit such Offer
Condition(s) to be satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the
Companys written consent, Purchaser shall not extend the Offer, and without
Purchasers prior written consent, Purchaser shall not be required to extend
the Offer, in each case beyond the earlier of the End Date and the termination
of this Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 1.1(c)_ shall be deemed to
impair, limit or otherwise restrict in any manner the right of the parties to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of
_Article 7_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of the Offer_. Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior
to its Expiration Date (as extended and re-extended in accordance with
_Section 1.1(c)_) without the prior written consent of the Company (in its
sole discretion), except if this Agreement has been terminated in accordance
with _Article 7_. If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article
7_, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to) promptly (and in any
event within two (2) Business Days of such termination), irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Company Shares
pursuant thereto. If the Offer is terminated by Purchaser, Purchaser shall,
and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, promptly return, and shall cause any
depositary acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance with Law,
all tendered Company Shares to the registered holders thereof and Purchaser
shall not, and Parent shall cause Purchaser not to, accept any Company Shares
pursuant to the Offer.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Payment for Company Shares_. On the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and the Offer, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall
cause Purchaser to) accept for payment, and pay for, all Company Shares that
are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly
(within the meaning of Rule 14e-1(c) promulgated under the Exchange Act) after
the Expiration Date (the time of such acceptance the " _Acceptance Time_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , that without the prior written consent of the Company
(in its sole discretion), Purchaser shall not accept for payment or pay for
any Company Shares if, as a result, Purchaser would acquire less than the
number of Company Shares necessary to satisfy the Minimum Condition. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall provide or cause to be
provided to Purchaser on a timely basis the funds necessary to pay for any and
all Company Shares that Purchaser becomes obligated to accept in the Offer and
purchase pursuant to the Offer and this Agreement. The Offer Price payable in
respect of each Company Share validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer shall be paid to the holder thereof in cash, without
interest, and net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section
2.8_.

 



 

(f) _Schedule TO and Offer Documents_. As soon as practicable on the date of
the commencement of the Offer in accordance with _Section 1.1(a)_, Parent and
Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule TO_"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal, a form of summary advertisement and
any schedule or form required to be filed pursuant to the Instructions to
Schedule TO (collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "). Purchaser may, but shall not be
required to, provide guaranteed delivery procedures for the tender of Company
Shares in the Offer; _provided_ , _however_ , that if Purchaser provides
guaranteed delivery procedures, for purposes of determining whether the
Minimum Condition has been satisfied, Parent and Purchaser shall include for
purposes of its determination thereof Company Shares tendered in the Offer
pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures (and such Company Shares shall be
deemed to be validly tendered) if and only if Company Shares subject to such
guarantees have been received by, or on behalf of, Purchaser as of the
Expiration Date. Parent and Purchaser agree to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, as and to the extent required by
federal securities Laws, including the Exchange Act. Parent and Purchaser
shall cause the Offer Documents to (i) comply with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act and (ii) as of the date first filed with the SEC and on
the date first published, sent or given to the holders of Company Shares, not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by Parent or
Purchaser with respect to information supplied by the Company for inclusion in
the Offer Documents. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company,
on the other hand, agree to promptly notify the other party and correct any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by Law, and Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer
Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Company Shares, in each case, as and to the extent required by Law,
or by the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ. Prior to an Adverse Recommendation
Change, the Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall consider in good faith any
comments from the Company or its counsel. In addition, prior to an Adverse
Recommendation Change, Parent and Purchaser shall provide in writing to the
Company and its counsel any written comments or other material written
communications (and shall orally describe any oral comments or other material
oral communication), that Parent and Purchaser or their counsel may receive
from time to time from the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental
Authority with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt, and any written or oral responses thereto. Prior to an Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the formulation of any response to any such
comments of the SEC or any other Governmental Authority or its staff,
including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any such
responses, which comments Parent and Purchaser shall consider in good faith.
Parent and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond
promptly to any such comments.

 



      
 

 



 

1.2 _Company Actions_.

 



 

(a) _Schedule 14D-9_. On the date that the Offer Documents are filed with the
SEC, the Company shall, in a manner that complies with the rules and
regulations promulgated by the SEC under the Exchange Act, including Rule
14d-9 thereunder, file with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule 14D-9_") that
shall, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.3_, contain the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, as and to the extent required by
federal securities laws, including the Exchange Act. The Company shall cause
the Schedule 14D-9 to (i) comply with applicable requirements of the Exchange
Act and (ii) as of the date first filed with the SEC and on the date first
published, sent or given to the holders of Company Shares, not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading; _provided_ , _however_ , that no covenant is made by the Company
with respect to information supplied by Parent or Purchaser for inclusion in
the Schedule 14D-9. Parent and Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, agree to promptly notify the other party and correct any
information included in, or incorporated by reference into, the Schedule
14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall have become false or misleading in
any material respect or as otherwise required by Law, and the Company agrees
to cause the Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Company Shares, in each case, as and to the extent
required by the Law, or by the SEC or its staff or NASDAQ. Prior to an Adverse
Recommendation Change (and except for a filing on Schedule 14D-9 to disclose
an Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with _Section 5.3_),
Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and
the Company shall consider in good faith any comments from Parent, Purchaser
or their counsel. In addition, prior to an Adverse Recommendation Change (and
except for comments or communications relating to a filing on Schedule 14D-9
to disclose an Adverse Recommendation Change made in compliance with _Section
5.3_), the Company shall provide in writing to Parent, Purchaser and their
counsel any written comments or other written communications (and shall orally
describe any oral comments or other material oral communication), that the
Company or its counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff
or any other Governmental Authority with respect to the Schedule 14D-9
promptly after receipt, and any written or oral responses thereto. Prior to an
Adverse Recommendation Change (and except for responses relating to a filing
on Schedule 14D-9 to disclose an Adverse Recommendation Change made in
compliance with _Section 5.3_), Parent, Purchaser and their counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to participate in the formulation of any
response to any such comments of the SEC or any other Governmental Authority
or its staff, including a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
such responses, which comments the Company shall consider in good faith. The
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to respond promptly to any
such comments.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Company Information_. Prior to an Adverse Recommendation Change, in
connection with the Offer, from time to time as reasonably requested by
Parent, Purchaser or their agents, the Company shall, or shall cause its
transfer agent to, promptly (and in any event no later than five (5) Business
Days after the date hereof) furnish to Purchaser and Parent a list, as of the
most recent practicable date, of the stockholders of the Company, mailing
labels and any available listing or computer files containing the names and
addresses of all record and beneficial holders of Company Shares, and lists of
security positions of Company Shares held in stock depositories (including
updated lists of stockholders, mailing labels, listings or files of securities
positions) and such other assistance as Parent, Purchaser or their agents may
reasonably request from time to time in communicating with the holders of
Company Shares. Except for such steps as are necessary to disseminate the
Offer Documents and any other documents necessary to consummate the Merger,
Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall: (i) hold in confidence the
information contained in any such lists of stockholders, mailing labels and
listings, computer files or files of securities positions in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement ( _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that
the Company consents to the use by Parent and Purchaser of such information as
is necessary to communicate the Offer and the Merger to the holders of Company
Shares, and acknowledges that such use does not constitute a breach of any
provision of the Confidentiality Agreement), (ii) use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to _Article 7_, Parent and Purchaser shall deliver to
(and shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
agents to deliver) the Company any and all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control.

The Merger shall be effected pursuant to Section 251(h) of the DGCL and shall

liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) The directors of Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time shall,
from and after the Effective Time, become the directors of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The officers of the
Company (other than the Chairman of the Company Board) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, continue as the

the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until
their respective successors shall have been duly elected or appointed and
qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance
with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

2.2 _Closing and Effective Time of the Merger_. The closing of the Merger (the
" _Closing_ ") will take place at 8:00 a.m., Eastern time, on the date of the
consummation of the Offer, subject to satisfaction or waiver of all of the

their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
fulfillment or waiver of those conditions at the Closing), at the offices of
Cleary Gottlieb Steen and Hamilton LLP, One Liberty Plaza, New York, New York
10006, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the

executed and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other
filings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at the time the Certificate of Merger shall have been
duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, or such later
date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (such date and time hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 



 

2.3 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Conversion of Company Shares_. Except as set forth in _Section 2.3(b)_,
for Dissenting Shares and for Company Restricted Shares, each Company Share
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive the Offer Price, without interest (the "
_Merger Consideration_ "), payable without interest in cash, net of applicable
withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.8_, upon surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 2.5_.

 



 

(b) _Excluded Company Shares_. Each Company Share (i) owned by Parent,
Purchaser or the Company, or by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary
of Parent, Purchaser or the Company, in each case outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time or (ii) irrevocably accepted for purchase pursuant
to the Offer (" _Accepted Company Shares_ "), shall, in each case, as of the
Effective Time, be canceled by virtue of the Merger without any consideration
paid therefor (other than, for the avoidance of doubt and without duplication,
any consideration that remains payable with respect to any such Accepted
Company Shares pursuant to the Offer).

 



 

(c) _Conversion of Purchaser Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of Purchaser issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one newly and validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

 



 

2.4 _Adjustments to the Offer Price and Merger Consideration_. The Offer Price
and Merger Consideration shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect
of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Shares),
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to Company Shares occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time.

 



 

2.5 _Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a
reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent (the identity and
terms of designation and appointment of which shall be reasonably acceptable
to the Company) for purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger
Consideration in connection with the Merger (the " _Paying Agent_ "). Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent.
Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited,
with the Paying Agent the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of
Company Shares shall be entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement. In the event such deposited funds are insufficient to make the
payments contemplated pursuant to _Section 2.3_, Parent shall promptly
deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent, such additional
funds to ensure that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds to make such
payments.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Procedures for Surrender_.

 



 

(i) _Certificates_. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time (and in no
event later than five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time), the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person that
was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company
Shares represented by certificates (the " _Certificates_ "), which Company
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (net
of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.8_ and without
interest) at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement: (i) a letter of
transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise be in such form as the
Company, Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (ii)
instructions for effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 2.5(e)_) in exchange
for payment of the Merger Consideration net of applicable withholding of Taxes
as provided in _Section 2.8_ and without interest. Upon surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu of the Certificate as provided in
_Section 2.5(e)_) to the Paying Agent, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates, the holder of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration for each Company Share formerly represented by such
Certificates (net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section
2.8_ and without interest), any Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section
2.8_ and without interest, in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, except
for Certificates representing Company Shares held by Dissenting Stockholders,
which, subject to _Section 2.6_, shall be deemed to represent the right to
receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in accordance with
and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no holder of non-certificated Company Shares represented by
book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall be required to deliver a
Certificate or, in the case of holders of Book-Entry Shares held through The
Depositary Trust Company, an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_. In lieu thereof, each holder of record
of one or more Book-Entry Shares held through The Depositary Trust Company
whose Company Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration shall, upon the receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying
Agent, be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to pay
and deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in respect of
each such Book-Entry Share a cash amount in immediately available funds equal
to the Merger Consideration (net of applicable withholding of Taxes as
provided in _Section 2.8_ and without interest), and such Book-Entry Shares
of such holder shall forthwith be canceled. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person that was, immediately prior to the Effective Time, a
holder of record of Book-Entry Shares not held through The Depositary Trust
Company: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall be in such form as the
Company, Parent and the Paying Agent shall reasonably agree; and (ii)
instructions for returning such letter of transmittal in exchange for the
Merger Consideration. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal, in
accordance with the terms of such letter of transmittal, duly executed, the
holder of such Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor a cash amount in immediately available funds equal to the Merger
Consideration (net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section
2.8_ and without interest), and such Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to
Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-
Entry Shares are registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of Book-Entry Shares. Until paid or surrendered as
contemplated hereby, each Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in cash, net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in
_Section 2.8_ and without interest, as contemplated by this Agreement, except
for Book-Entry Shares representing Company Shares held by Dissenting
Stockholders, which, subject to _Section 2.6_, shall be deemed to represent
the right to receive payment of the fair value of such Company Shares in
accordance with and to the extent provided by Section 262 of the DGCL.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the
records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company
Shares except as otherwise provided for herein or by Law. If, after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for
any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability_. Any portion of
the funds (including any interest received with respect thereto) made
available to the Paying Agent that remains unclaimed by the holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares nine (9) months after the Effective Time
will be returned to the Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof
designated by the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holder who
has not tendered its Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with _Section 2.5(b)_ prior to such time shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for delivery of the Merger
Consideration, without interest and net of applicable withholding of Taxes as
provided in _Section 2.8_, in respect of such holders surrender of their
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and compliance with the procedures in
_Section 2.5(b)_. Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by the holders
of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental
Authority will, to the extent permitted by Law, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation or an Affiliate thereof designated by the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of any claim or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Purchaser,
the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their respective affiliates
will be liable to any holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger
Consideration delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger
Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ hereof;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the
owners of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in a
reasonable sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 



 

2.6 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (but subject to the provisions of this _Section 2.6_), Company
Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a
holder who is entitled to demand and has properly demanded appraisal for such
Company Shares in accordance with, and who complies in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (such Company Shares, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ", and
such holder, a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration. At the Effective Time, all
Dissenting Shares shall be cancelled and cease to exist, and the holders of
Dissenting Shares shall only be entitled to the rights granted to them under
the DGCL. If any such holder fails to perfect or otherwise waives, withdraws
or loses his right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or other Law,
then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Dissenting
Shares shall cease and such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been
converted, as of the Effective Time, into and shall be exchangeable solely for
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest and net of
applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.8_. The Company
shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for
appraisal of Company Shares, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any
other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
relating to rights to be paid the fair value of Dissenting Shares. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or compromise or offer
to settle or compromise, any such demands.

 



 

2.7 _Treatment of Company Options and Company Restricted Shares_.

 



 

(a) _No Assumption of Awards_. No Company Options or Company Restricted Shares
shall, for purposes of the Company Stock Plans or otherwise, be continued,
converted, assumed or replaced by the Surviving Corporation in connection with
the Transactions.

 



 

(b) _Treatment of Vested Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
each outstanding, unexpired and unexercised Company Option that is vested and
exercisable or that, by the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan or
award agreement, would automatically become vested and exercisable as a result
of the occurrence of the Transactions (the " _Vested Options_ ") shall be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Vested Option shall be entitled to receive, in consideration for the
cancellation of such Vested Option in settlement therefor, a payment in cash
(net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.8_ and
without interest) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number of
Company Shares subject to such Vested Option immediately prior to such
cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Company Share subject to such Vested Option immediately
prior to such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to
as the " _Option Payments_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, no holder of a
Vested Option that, as of immediately prior to such cancellation, has an
exercise price per Company Share that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall be entitled to any payment with respect to such cancelled
Vested Option, which shall be cancelled without consideration therefor. From
and after the Effective Time, each Vested Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment, if any. As soon as practicable following
the Closing, but in any event on or prior to the next applicable payroll
payment date (but no later than fifteen (15) days) following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation shall make by a payroll payment through the Companys or
Purchasers payroll provider or a payment through the Companys stock plan
administrator and net of applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in
_Section 2.8_ and without interest thereon, to each holder of Vested Options
such holders Option Payment.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Treatment of Vested Restricted Shares_. Immediately prior to the
Effective Time, each award of Company Restricted Shares that is outstanding
and vested or that, by the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan or award
agreement, would automatically become vested as a result of the Transactions
(the " _Vested Restricted Shares_ ") shall be cancelled and, in exchange
therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled Vested Restricted Shares
shall be entitled to receive, in consideration of the cancellation of such
Vested Restricted Shares and in settlement therefor, a payment in cash
(subject to any applicable withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.8_
and without interest), equal to the product of (i) the total number of Vested
Restricted Shares immediately prior to such cancellation (which, in the case
of awards of performance-vesting Vested Restricted Shares, shall be calculated
"Target Level" performance (as defined in the applicable award agreement
governing such Vested Restricted Shares)) and (ii) the Merger Consideration
(such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the " _Restricted Share
Payments_ "). As soon as practicable following the Closing, but in any event
on or prior to the next applicable payroll payment date (but no later than
fifteen (15) days) following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation shall make
by a payroll payment through the Companys or Purchasers payroll provider or
a payment through the Companys stock plan administrator net of applicable
withholding of Taxes as provided in _Section 2.8_ and without interest
thereon to each holder of Vested Restricted Shares such holders Restricted
Share Payment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Offer shall not apply to the Vested Restricted Shares, and no Vested
Restricted Shares may be tendered pursuant to the Offer.

 



 

(d) _Company Share Purchase Plan_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
may continue to operate the Company Share Purchase Plan in accordance with its
terms; _provided_ , that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
Company Share Purchase Plan, (i) the Company shall not permit any individual
to, and no individual shall, increase the amount of an existing election, or
make a new election, with respect to payroll deductions thereunder; (ii) the
offering period ongoing as of the date of this Agreement shall be the final
offering period under the Company Share Purchase Plan and the currently
outstanding purchase rights under the Company Share Purchase Plan shall be
exercised immediately prior to the earlier of (x) the next regularly scheduled
Trading Window (as defined in the Company Share Purchase Plan) under the
Company Share Purchase Plan or (y) the date that is seven Business Days prior
to the Effective Date (such date, the " _Final Enrollment Date_ ") and any
participant payroll deductions not applied to the purchase of Company Common
Stock on the Final Enrollment Date shall be returned to participants pursuant
to the terms of the Company Share Purchase Plan; and (iii) no additional
options shall be granted upon or after such Final Enrollment Date. The Company
shall terminate the Company Share Purchase Plan, effective as of the Effective
Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) _Board Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if
appropriate, any committee thereof) shall adopt appropriate resolutions and
take all other actions as it deems necessary and appropriate to effect the
transactions described in this _Section 2.7_.

 



 

2.8 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation
and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, such amounts that Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be,
is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or any
provision of Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent,
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall
timely remit to the appropriate Governmental Authority any and all amounts so
deducted or withheld.

 



 

2.9 _Necessary Further Actions_. Each of the Company, Parent and Purchaser
agree to take all necessary action to cause the Merger to become effective as
soon as practicable following the Acceptance Time without a meeting of the
Companys stockholders, as provided in Section 251(h) of the DGCL and upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement. In furtherance, and
without limiting the generality, of the foregoing, neither Parent nor
Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and Purchaser shall cause their respective
Affiliates and Representatives not to, take any action that could render
Section 251(h) of the DGCL inapplicable to the Merger. If, at any time after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised
that any deeds, bills of sale, assignments, assurances or any other actions or
things are necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise the Surviving Corporations right, title or interest in,
to or under, or duty or obligation with respect to, any of the property,
rights, privileges, powers or franchises, or any of the debts or Liabilities,
of the Company as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, or otherwise
to carry out the intent of this Agreement, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company, all such deeds, bills of sale, assignments,
assumptions and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may be
necessary or desirable to continue, vest, perfect or confirm of record or
otherwise any and all right, title and interest in, to and under, or duty or
obligation with respect to, such property, rights, privileges, powers or
franchises, or any such debts or Liabilities, in the Surviving Corporation or
otherwise to carry out the intent of this Agreement.

Parent on the date hereof (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being
understood that any information set forth in one section or subsection of the
Company Disclosure Letter corresponding to _Article 3_ of this Agreement
shall be deemed to apply to and qualify the section or subsection of this
Agreement to which it corresponds and each other section or subsection of
_Article 3_ of this Agreement to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such information is relevant to such other section or

with the SEC on or after August 1, 2016 and prior to the date of this
Agreement, other than any disclosures contained in the forward-looking

Directors_.

 



 

(a) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority required to conduct its business as
currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and, where such concept is recognized, is in good standing in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified and in
good standing would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(b) _Section 3.1(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true,
correct and complete list of the Companys Subsidiaries as of the date of this
Agreement and, for each such Subsidiary, (i) its jurisdiction of incorporation
or formation, (ii) the class and amount of its authorized, issued and
outstanding capital stock or other equity or voting interests, (iii) the name
of each of its shareholders or equity owners and (iv) the number of shares of
capital stock or other equity or voting interests owned by each such holder.
Except as would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect, each of the Companys Subsidiaries (A) has been duly organized
and is validly existing and, where such concept is recognized, is in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization; (B) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation to do business and, where such concept is
recognized, is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of
the business conducted by it makes such qualification necessary; and (C) has
all requisite corporate power and authority required to conduct its business

respect. _Section 3.1(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a
correct and complete list of the officers and directors of each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

3.2 _Corporate Authorization_.

 



 

(a) Assuming the accuracy of the representations set forth in _Section 4.7_,
the Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to enter into and
to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the
Transactions. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized
by the Company Board and, except for the filing of the Certificate of Merger
with the Delaware Secretary of State, require no other corporate action on the
part of the Company. Assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Purchaser of this Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the legal,
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms, subject to laws of general application relating
to bankruptcy, insolvency, the relief of debtors, reorganization, moratorium
and other similar laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors rights and by general principles of equity (collectively, the "
_Enforceability Exceptions_ "). Assuming the Merger is consummated in
accordance with Section 251(h) of the DGCL, no vote of the holders of any of
the Company capital stock is necessary to authorize or adopt this Agreement or
to consummate the Transactions.

 



 

(b) At a meeting duly called and held, the Company Board has unanimously
adopted resolutions, which (i) determined that this Agreement, the Tender

under, or cause or give others a right of termination, vesting, amendment,
cancellation or acceleration under, any material Contract of Parent or
Purchaser, except in the case of clauses (b) and (c) above, as would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. If Parent

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time following the date hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time the
Company or any of its Representatives receives a bona fide unsolicited written
Competing Proposal from a Third Party (which Competing Proposal was initially
made after the date of this Agreement and did not result from a breach of this
_Section 5.3_), and if the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors, and
based on information then available, that such Competing Proposal constitutes
or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company and its Representatives may furnish information concerning the Company
and its Subsidiaries to such Third Party making the Competing Proposal and
engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party with respect to
such Competing Proposal; _provided_ , that (A) prior to so furnishing such
information or engaging in any such discussions or negotiations, the Company
receives from such Third Party an executed Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement and (B) any non-public information concerning the Company or its
Subsidiaries provided or made available to such Third Party shall, to the
extent not previously provided or made available to Parent, also be promptly
(and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours after it is provided or made
available to such Third Party) provided or made available to Parent. The
Company shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify
Parent in the event that the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
Competing Proposal and shall disclose to Parent the material terms and
conditions of any such Competing Proposal (including the identity of the Third
Party making such Competing Proposal). The Company shall (i) promptly (and in
any event within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent of any material change
to the material terms of any such Competing Proposal of which the Company has
been informed, or any determination by the Company Board that any Competing
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (ii) promptly notify Parent of (A) any material negotiation sessions
between such Third Party or its Representatives on the one hand, and the
Company or its Representatives, on the other hand, including providing a high-
level summary of the material terms and conditions discussed in such material
negotiation session and (B) if the Company, or such Third Party has informed
the Company that it, has decided to not pursue such Competing Proposal and
(iii) provide to Parent as soon as practicable (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) after receipt or delivery thereof of any written
indication of interest (or amendment thereto) or any written material that
constitutes an offer (or amendment thereto) including copies of any proposed
Alternative Acquisition Agreements and any financing commitments related
thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, following the receipt
of a Competing Proposal, contact such Third Party to clarify and understand
the terms and conditions thereof to facilitate the Company Boards
determination with respect to whether such Competing Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
(i) if (A) the Company receives a bona fide unsolicited written Competing
Proposal that the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel and its financial advisors, constitutes a Superior
Proposal and (B) the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with
outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to the Company and the
stockholders of the Company under Law, then the Company Board may make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(e)_ to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior
Proposal; and (ii) the Company Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to material events, changes or developments in circumstances that
were not known to or reasonably foreseeable by the Company Board as of or
prior to the date hereof and becomes known to the Company Board after the date
hereof and prior to the Acceptance Time if the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company Board to
the Company and the stockholders of the Company under Law; _provided_ , that
the Company Board may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 5.3(c)_ unless:

 



 

(1) the Company shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent, at
least four (4) Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of the
Companys intention to take any action permitted under this _Section 5.3(c)_,
which notice shall, if applicable, specify the reasons for the proposed
Adverse Recommendation Change and, if applicable, the material terms and
conditions of any Superior Proposal (including the identity of the Third Party
making such Superior Proposal) and, if applicable, provide a copy of the
relevant proposed transaction agreement; and

 



 

(2) prior to making an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or terminating this
Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
its Representatives to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, (x) in the
case of _Section 5.3(c)(i)_, such Competing Proposal ceases to constitute a
Superior Proposal and (y) in the case of _Section 5.3(c)(i)_ or _Section
5.3(c)(ii)_, the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel, that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation
Change would not be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties owed by the Company
Board to the Company and the stockholders of the Company under Law. In the
event of any material revisions to a Competing Proposal constituting a
Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written
notice to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this _Section 5.3(c)_
with respect to such new written notice, except that references to the four
(4) Business Day period above shall be deemed to be references to a two (2)
Business Day period.

 



      
 

 



 

For the avoidance of doubt, if Parent, within four (4) Business Days following
its receipt of a Superior Proposal notice makes an offer that, as determined
in good faith by the Company Board (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors), results in the applicable Competing Proposal
no longer being a Superior Proposal, then the Company shall have no right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(e)_ as a result of such
Competing Proposal.

 



 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.3_ or elsewhere in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof from (i)
taking and disclosing to the stockholders of the Company a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii)
making any "stop, look and listen" communication to the stockholders of the
Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (iii)
making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company that is required by
Law; _provided_ , that this _Section 5.3(d)_ shall not permit the Company
Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Changes except as otherwise set forth
expressly in this _Section 5.3_.

 



 

5.4 _Certain Filings_. The Company and Parent shall cooperate with one another
in connection with the preparation of the Schedule 14D-9 and the Offer
Documents and any other documents required to be filed by the Company, Parent
or Purchaser with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, including
furnishing information reasonably required in connection therewith; _provided_
, _however_ , that the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.4_ shall not
be deemed to have been breached as a result of actions by the Company
permitted by _Section 5.3_.

each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company shall use its commercially

manner practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions,
including using commercially reasonable efforts to: (i) cause each of the
conditions to the Offer set forth on _Annex I_ and each of the conditions to

stockholders so tender is in their sole discretion); and (ii) obtain, as
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and maintain all

expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or obtain approval under any other Antitrust Law as soon as practicable.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable: (i) if Parent determines it is
advisable or CFIUS requests or requires filings related thereto, subject to
_Section 5.5(h)_, CFIUS Clearance and (ii) subject to _Section 5.5(f)_, the
agreement by the Defense Security Service (" _DSS_ ") in the form of a

good faith the views of such counsel in connection with, any proposed
communications by such party or its Affiliates to DSS or CFIUS concerning the
Transactions (except for personal identifier information or other confidential

promptly as practicable, including proposing, negotiating, committing to and
effecting, by mitigation agreement, letter of assurance or commitment,
national security agreement, security control agreement, special security
agreement, voting trust agreement or proxy agreement, restrictions or actions
that after the Closing would limit Parents freedom of action, ownership,
control, influence, management or access over the business of the Company and
its Subsidiaries; _provided_ that notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Agreement shall obligate Parent or Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Parent
to, and the Company shall not and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to not,
take any of the foregoing actions or agree to any of the foregoing limitations
with respect to any portion of the business of the Company and its
Subsidiaries other than the portion thereof requiring a facility clearance

of Defense if services for non-classified customers of the Department of
Defense are shifted to a foreign entity.

 



 

(g) Each of the parties hereto will use its commercially reasonable efforts to

participate in such meetings and teleconferences. The parties will use their
commercially reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure
under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense
privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.5(e)_ in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege. The Company and Parent may,
as each reasonably deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
5.5_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material" and redact personally identifiable
information or classified information.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) After considering the Companys views in good faith, Parent shall have,
except where prohibited by Law, responsibility for determining the strategy
for dealing with any Governmental Authority regarding Law relating to

Purchaser or any Subsidiary of Parent to, and the Company shall not and shall
cause each Company Subsidiary to not, agree to limit in any manner whatsoever
(i) any rights of ownership of any securities (including the Company Shares),
or to divest, dispose of or hold separate any securities or all or a portion

promptly notify the other parties of (a) any fact(s), change(s), event(s),
development(s) or circumstance(s) that have occurred, arisen or come into
existence and become known to the notifying party, that would reasonably be
expected to cause any condition to the obligations of the notifying party to
effect the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions not to be satisfied, (b) the
failure of the notifying party to comply with or satisfy any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this
Agreement which would reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the
obligations of any party to effect the Offer, the Merger or the Transactions
not to be satisfied, and (c) any Proceedings commenced by or involving any
current or former stockholder of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (on
their own behalf or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries)
arising out of or related to this Agreement or the Transactions ("
_Stockholder Litigation_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise modify the conditions to the obligations of any party to effect the
Offer, the Merger or the Transactions, nor limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder.

issue a joint press release with respect to the execution of this Agreement.
Thereafter, the Company and Parent shall not, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries not to, issue any press release or other announcement (to the
extent not previously publicly disclosed or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions without the
prior consent of the other party (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), except (a) as such press release or other
announcement may be required by Law or the applicable rules of a national
securities exchange, in which case the party required to issue the release or
make the announcement shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
the other party with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
release or announcement in advance of its issuance, (b) that each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries may make announcements from time to time to their
respective employees, customers, suppliers and other business relations and
otherwise as the Company may reasonably determine is necessary to comply with
Law or the requirements of any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or (c) in connection with an Adverse Recommendation
Change if and to the extent permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

content to the extent replicated in whole or in part in any subsequent press
release or other announcement.

in any manner adverse to the Indemnified Persons except as required by Law.

misstatement, misleading statement, act, omission, neglect, breach of duty or
any matter claimed against an Indemnified Person by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity that existed or occurred at or prior to the Effective

paid for such tail policy exceed two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the
amount per annum the Company paid in its last full fiscal year; _provided_ ,
_further_ that the Company shall give Parent a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the selection of such tail policy and give reasonable and good
faith consideration to any comments made by Parent with respect thereto and
the Company shall not purchase such policy (and shall purchase the alternative
policy identified by Parent) if Parent shall have identified an alternative
policy satisfying the foregoing requirements at a lesser premium. If the
Company or the Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail"
insurance policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
continue to maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from

with the Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with
the same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in all respects than the coverage
provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or the
Surviving Corporation shall purchase from the Companys current insurance
carrier or from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as
the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to DandO Insurance
comparable DandO Insurance for such six (6) year period with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are no less favorable than as provided
in the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof; _provided_ , that in
no event shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend for
such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual premium amount in excess of
two hundred fifty percent (250%) of the amount per annum the Company paid in
its last full fiscal year; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the aggregate
premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving
Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for
a cost not exceeding such amount.

 



 

(d) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger,
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and

that is adverse to any Indemnified Person (and their respective successors and
assigns) without the consent of such affected Indemnified Person (or their
respective successors and assigns).

render such anti-takeover Law inapplicable to the foregoing.

the Merger shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

all actions necessary or advisable to ensure such payment, performance and
discharge by Purchaser hereunder. Parent shall, immediately following
execution of this Agreement, approve and adopt this Agreement in its capacity
as sole stockholder of Purchaser and deliver to the Company evidence of its
vote or action by written consent approving and adopting this Agreement in
accordance with applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation and bylaws

necessary for the satisfaction of all of Parents and Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement, including the payment of the aggregate Offer Price and
Merger Consideration and the consideration in respect of the Company Options
and Company Restricted Shares and to pay all related fees and expenses. Parent

5.14 _Employees_.

 



 

(a) Parent hereby acknowledges that a "change of control" and/or "acquisition"
(or other similar phrase) within the meaning of the Plans, as applicable, will
occur as of the Acceptance Time. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
(or an applicable Subsidiary thereof) to honor the Plans that provide for
severance and change in control obligations and/or transaction-based payments
and benefits in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to
the date hereof and any other agreements with employees entered into in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , that such Plans have

benefits (including severance benefits, and group health, life and disability
plans, but excluding benefits provided pursuant to any defined benefit pension
plan) that are substantially similar, in the aggregate, taken as a whole, to
the base compensation, bonus or incentive opportunities and employee and
fringe benefits provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, for purposes of determining eligibility
to participate, vesting and entitlement to benefits where length of service is
relevant under any benefit plan or arrangement of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates (each, a " _Parent Benefit
Plan_ "), Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Continuing
Employee to receive service credit for service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the same extent such service credit was granted under the
Plans (for purposes of eligibility to participate and vesting and, solely in
respect of vacation and severance plans, benefit accrual purposes) immediately
prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions, actively at
work requirements, waiting periods and insurability requirements with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing
Employees (and any dependents or beneficiaries thereof) under any welfare
benefit plans that such employees may be eligible to participate in after the
Effective Time, other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in
effect with respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of
the Effective Time under the applicable Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (ii) cause any co-payments, deductibles and other out-of-
pocket expenses incurred by a Continuing Employee during the plan year that
includes the Effective Time to be credited for purposes of satisfying all
deductible, co-payment and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such Continuing Employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable
plan year of each comparable Parent Benefit Plan, as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such plan; _provided_ , that in each case (i) and
(ii), such waiver or credit shall only be to the extent (A) that such
limitation or payment would have been waived or credited in the corresponding
Plan in which such Continuing Employee was a participant immediately prior to
his commencement of participation in such Parent Benefit Plan and (B) that
would not result in any duplication of benefits. Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, use commercially reasonable
efforts to honor all vacation, personal and sick days accrued by Continuing
Employees under the plans, policies, programs and arrangements of the Company
and its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, no
provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) guarantee employment for
any period of time for, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation to terminate the employment of, any Continuing Employee for any
reason, (ii) require Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any
particular Plan or Parent Benefit Plan or prevent the amendment, modification
or termination thereof after the Effective Time (it being understood that
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with any obligations
set forth in _Section 5.14(a)_ ) or (iii) be treated as an amendment or other
modification of any Plan or Parent Benefit Plan. The provisions of this
_Section 5.14_ are solely for the benefit of the parties to this Agreement,
and no Continuing Employee (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) or
other Person shall be regarded for any purpose as a third party beneficiary of
this Agreement, and no provision of this _Section 5.14_ shall create such
rights in any such Persons.

 



 

5.15 _Director Resignations_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to
Parent evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation of the
directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries (other than directors of the
Subsidiaries whom Parent determines shall continue to serve in such capacities
following the Effective Time), effective at the Effective Time.

 



 

5.16 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) notify Parent in

customary joint defense agreement, and at Parents expense) in, but not
control, the defense and settlement of, any Stockholder Litigation. The
parties shall cooperate in good faith to address to any Stockholder
Litigation. No compromise or full or partial settlement of any Stockholder
Litigation (other than any settlement providing solely for supplemental
disclosures to the Companys stockholders) shall be agreed to by the Company
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



      
 

 



 

5.17 _Payoff of Existing Company Indebtedness_. The Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (a) obtain customary payoff letters
reasonably acceptable to Parent from all financial institutions and other
Persons to which indebtedness for borrowed money of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is owed, or the applicable agent, trustee or other representative
on behalf of such Persons, which payoff letters together with any related
release documentation shall, among other things, include the payoff amount and
provide in substance reasonably acceptable to Parent, among other things, that
Liens and guarantees, if any, granted in connection therewith related to the
assets, rights and properties of the Company and its Subsidiaries securing
such indebtedness for borrowed money and any other obligations secured thereby
shall be, upon the payment of the amount set forth in the applicable payoff
letter at or prior to the consummation of the Offer be released and terminated
and (b) deliver or cause to be delivered such payoff letters, together with
the related release documentation, to Parent at the consummation of the Offer.
At the consummation of the Offer, subject to Parent making available necessary
funds to do so, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, and
shall cause the Companys Subsidiaries to, permanently (i) terminate the
credit facilities requested by Parent to be so terminated, and all related
Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party and (ii)
cause to be released any guarantees and any Liens on its assets relating to
such terminated credit facilities.

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each of Parent
and Purchaser acknowledges and agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates

a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Purchaser in the
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is payable for the efforts and
resources expended and opportunity forgone while negotiating this Agreement
and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation
of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Each of the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section 7.2_ are an integral part of the Transactions, and that
without these agreements, Parent, Purchaser and the Company would not enter
into this Agreement.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, each
of the parties hereto expressly acknowledges and agrees that except in the
event of Fraud based upon, or any Willful Breach of, any representation,
warranty or covenant or agreement contained herein, Parents right to receive
payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to this _Section 7.2_ , in
circumstances in which the Termination Fee is paid, shall constitute the sole
and exclusive remedy of Parent and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates

partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, trustees, officers,
employees, agents or Affiliates (the " _Parent Related Parties_ ") against the

partners, stockholders, members, managers, directors, officers, employees,
agents or Affiliates (collectively, the " _Company Related Parties_ ") for all
any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, fees, expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, inquiries
and fines suffered in respect of this Agreement or the Transactions in such
circumstances, and upon payment of the Termination Fee to Parent pursuant to
this _Section 7.2_ , none of the Company Related Parties shall have any
further liability or obligation to any of the Parent Related Parties relating
to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions, except in the event
of Fraud based upon, or any Willful Breach of, any representation, warranty or
covenant or agreement contained herein. The parties acknowledge that any prior
payment of the Termination Fee shall be taken into account when determining
(or, if appropriate, netted against) any remedies for Fraud based upon, or
Willful Breach of, any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein.

 



 

(h) All payments under _Section 7.2_ shall be made by wire transfer of

8.6 _Headings_. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

 



 

8.7 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 



      
 

 



 

8.8 _Amendments_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended prior to the
Acceptance Time if, but only if, such amendment is in writing and is signed by
each party to this Agreement.

 



 

8.9 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Acceptance Time, any party hereto may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party or parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other party or parties contained herein
or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance by the
other party or parties with any of the agreements or conditions contained
herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but
such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

 



 

8.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits and
Company Disclosure Letter and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto)
together with the Tender Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement contain
all of the terms, conditions and representations and warranties agreed to by
the parties relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and constitute
the entire agreement and understanding of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements (except the Confidentiality Agreement) and understandings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, on such matters.

 



 

8.11 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assigned by any party by
operation of law or otherwise without the prior written consent of the other
parties. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 8.11_
shall be null and void.

 



 

8.12 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. The provisions of this Agreement are be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns, and no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder
upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective successors
and, except (a) as provided in _Section 5.8_ (which will be to the benefit of
the Persons referred to in such Section) and (b) following the Effective Time,
the rights of the Companys stockholders (who are not Dissenting Stockholders)
to receive the Merger Consideration. The representations and warranties in
this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and
are for the sole benefit of the parties hereto. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto, and consequently,
may not accurately characterize actual facts or circumstances.

 



 

8.13 _Mutual Drafting; Interpretation_.

 



 

(a) Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement,
which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between
the parties. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any provision.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) Unless the context otherwise requires, references to agreements and other
documents shall be deemed to include all subsequent amendments and other
modifications thereto.

 



 

(ii) Whenever this Agreement refers to a number of days, such number shall
refer to calendar days unless Business Days are specified.

 



 

(iii) The word "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which a subject or
other thing extends, and such phrase shall not mean simply "if".

 



 

(iv) All accounting terms used herein and not expressly defined herein shall
have the meanings given to them under GAAP.

 



 

(v) The word "party" shall, unless the context otherwise requires, be
construed to mean a party to this Agreement. Any reference to a party to this
Agreement or any other agreement or document contemplated hereby shall include
such partys successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

(vi) Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all references to "dollars" or
"$" shall refer to the lawful currency of the United States.

 



 

(vii) The singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa; the
masculine gender shall include the feminine and neuter genders; the feminine
gender shall include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter gender
shall include masculine and feminine genders.

 



 

(viii) As used in this Agreement, the words "include" and "including" and
variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of limitation, but rather
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

 



 

(ix) All Exhibits and Schedules annexed hereto or referred to herein are
hereby incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in
full herein. Any capitalized terms used in any Exhibit or Schedule but not
otherwise defined therein, shall have the meaning as defined in this
Agreement. Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement to
"Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended to refer to
Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and Schedules to this
Agreement.

 



 

(x) The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder" and words of
similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular section or article in which such words
appear.

 



 

(xi) Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the term "or" shall
not be deemed to be exclusive.

 



      
 

 



 

8.14 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Trial by Jury_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement, and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any claim
or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement or as an inducement
to enter into this Agreement), shall be governed by the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that would
result in the application of any Law other than the Law of the State of
Delaware.

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any Proceeding with
respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder, or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect of this Agreement
and the rights and obligations arising hereunder brought by any other party
hereto or its successors or assigns, will be brought and determined
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery
declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any state or federal
court within the State of Delaware). Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for itself and in
respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the personal
jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not bring any
action relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions in any court
other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions, (i) any
claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named
courts for any reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this
_Section 8.14_ , (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune
from the jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in
such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the Law, any claim
that (A) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B)
the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (C) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive
and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably
consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in _Section
8.3_ and agrees that service made in such manner shall have the same legal
force and effect as if served upon such party personally within the State of
Delaware. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this
Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE
AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND
HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS
VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.14(c)_.

 



      
 

 



 

8.15 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be signed in any number of
counterparts, including by facsimile or other electronic transmission each of
which shall be an original, with the same effect as if the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each party hereto shall have received a counterpart hereof
signed by all of the other parties hereto. Until and unless each party has
received a counterpart hereof signed by the other party hereto, this Agreement
shall have no effect and no party shall have any right or obligation hereunder
(whether by virtue of any other oral or written agreement or other
communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts or
otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall be
sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

 



 

8.16 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at Law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine, and accordingly, (a) the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific
performance of the terms hereof, in each case in the Delaware Court of
Chancery and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware
(or, if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law
or in equity, (b) the parties waive any requirement for the securing or
posting of any bond in connection with the obtaining of any specific
performance or injunctive relief and (c) the parties will waive, in any action
for specific performance, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at Law. Any
partys pursuit of specific performance at any time will not be deemed an
election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other right or
remedy to which such party may be entitled, including, except as provided in
_Section 7.2(g)_ , the right to pursue remedies for liabilities or damages
incurred or suffered by such party in the case of a breach of this Agreement
involving fraud or Willful Breach.

 



      
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Purchaser and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.

(b) At the Expiration Date, any of the following conditions shall not be
satisfied (or have been waived):

 



 

(i) the applicable waiting period, together with any extensions thereof, under
the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated (the " _HSR Condition_ ");

 



 

(ii) DSS Consent shall have been obtained (the " _DSS Condition_ ");

 



 

(iii) no Law or Order of any Governmental Authority with competent
jurisdiction shall be in effect which (A) restrains, prohibits or otherwise
makes illegal the consummation of the Offer or the Merger or (B) except as
contemplated by _Section 5.5(f)_ of the Merger Agreement, imposes any
limitations on the ownership or operation by Parent (or any of its
Subsidiaries) of all or any portion of businesses or assets of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries, or compels Parent, the
Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to dispose of or hold separate
any portion of the businesses or assets of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries (the condition under this paragraph (iii), together
with the HSR Condition and the DSS Condition, the " _Regulatory Conditions_

_Section 3.1(a)_ , _Section 3.2_ , _Section 3.5(a)_ , _Section 3.5(c)_ and
_Section 3.20_ of the Merger Agreement shall be true and correct in all
respects as of the Expiration Date as though made on and as of the Expiration
Date (except that those representations and warranties which address matters
only as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such date),
except, in the case of _Section 3.5(a)_ and _Section 3.5(c)_ , to the extent
that any inaccuracies in such Sections would be de minimis, and (B) any other
representations and warranties of the Company contained in the Merger
Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Expiration Date (without giving
effect to any references to any "Company Material Adverse Effect" or other
"materiality" qualifications) as though made on and as of the Expiration Date
(except that those representations and warranties which address matters only
as of a particular date need only be true and correct as of such date) except
where failure to be so true and correct would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

 



      
 

 



 

(vi) the Company shall have complied with or performed in all material
respects all covenants and obligations that the Company is required to comply
with or to perform at or prior to the Expiration Date;

 



 

(vii) the Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate signed by an
executive officer of the Company and dated as of Expiration Date to the effect
that the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(v) and (b)(vi) have been

_Merger Agreement_ "), dated as of July 25, 2017 by and among Parent,
Purchaser and Company.
