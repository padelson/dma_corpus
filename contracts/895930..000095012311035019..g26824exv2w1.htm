the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income,
gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Company and its

amended and any terms or conditions may not be waived except by a written agreement signed by the
Parent, Merger Sub and the Stockholders&#146; Representative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any
party in exercising any right under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement
will operate
as a waiver of such right, and no single or partial exercise of any such right will preclude
any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right. The waiver, in
accordance with <U>Article&nbsp;V</U> above, of any condition based on the accuracy of any
representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation,
will not affect the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based on such
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. To the maximum extent permitted by Legal
Requirements, (a)&nbsp;no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (b)&nbsp;no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a
waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to
take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are
cumulative and not alternative.

court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall
be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; provided, however, that the
remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated
in any way unless such invalid or unenforceable provision or clause is so significant as to
materially affect the expectations of Parent and the Company regarding this Agreement. Otherwise,
any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by the Parent and the Stockholders&#146;
Representative with a valid provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic
effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision.

pursuant to that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of April&nbsp;7, 2011 (as amended or modified, the
&#147;<B>Merger Agreement</B>&#148;), by and among Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, and Brazos GP Partners, LLC,
solely as representative of the Former Stakeholders for certain purposes therein (the
&#147;<B>Stockholders&#146; Representative</B>&#148;), the undersigned, being the registered holder(s) of the stock
certificate(s) identified in the table above (the &#147;<B>Certificate(s)</B>&#148;), which represent all of the
shares of Company Common Stock, Series&nbsp;A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;C Convertible
Preferred Stock and Series&nbsp;D Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, as applicable, owned by
the undersigned (collectively the Company Common Stock, Series&nbsp;A Convertible Preferred Stock,
Series&nbsp;C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series&nbsp;D Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, the
&#147;<B>NSC Shares</B>&#148;), encloses herewith, delivers and surrenders the Certificate(s). In accordance with
the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive, without duplication, the Per
Common Share Consideration; each share of Series&nbsp;A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share

defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the
transactions contemplated thereby. Holders of (i)&nbsp;seventy-five percent of each class of the
Company Preferred Stock outstanding and (ii)&nbsp;a majority of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock
(voting on an &#147;as-converted&#148; basis) and the Company Common Stock, voting together as a single
class, have adopted by written consent pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the <B>&#147;DGCL&#148;</B>) the Merger Agreement, thereby approving the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement has been adopted by all
necessary action on the part of the Company and the stockholders of NSC (the <B>&#147;NSC Stockholders&#148;</B>).
However, in order to receive your share of the amounts specified in <U>Section&nbsp;1.6</U> of the
Merger Agreement, you will need to execute and deliver this Letter of Transmittal and Waiver of
Appraisal Rights. For your information and convenience, a copy of the Merger Agreement is enclosed
herewith.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;228 of the DGCL requires that prompt notice of the taking of corporate action, such as
approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger,
without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of stockholders shall be given to those
stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting,
would have been entitled to notice of the meeting. This Letter of Transmittal constitutes the
notice required to be given to the NSC Stockholders who did not execute the written consents
approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as
required by Section&nbsp;228 of the DGCL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You as an NSC Stockholder have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of your NSC
Shares, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the Merger is completed, and then only
to the extent you comply with all requirements of Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL, the full text of which
is attached as <U>Exhibit&nbsp;B</U> to this Letter of Transmittal. The appraisal amount you would
receive could be more than, the same as or less than the amount you would be entitled to receive
under the terms of the Merger Agreement. If you intend to exercise such appraisal rights then you
must, among other things, submit a written demand for an appraisal to the Company within the time
period specified by Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures
specified in Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. This Letter
of Transmittal is intended to serve as notice to you, as a NSC Stockholder, of your appraisal
rights, as required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the complexity of Section&nbsp;262 of the DGCL, you should consult with your advisors,
including legal counsel, in connection with any demand for appraisal. Any demand for an appraisal
should be sent to NSC at the following address:

Parent (the &#147;Payor&#148;) with the Payee&#146;s correct TIN if you are a U.S. person (as defined in the
instructions to the enclosed IRS Form W-9), which, in the case of a Payee who is an
individual, is the Payee&#146;s social security number. If the Payor is not provided with the
correct TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, the Payee may be subject to a $50 penalty
imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) and backup withholding at a rate of 28&nbsp;percent
on the gross proceeds received pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding is not an
additional tax. Rather, the tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding will be
reduced by the amount withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund
may be obtained provided the required information is timely furnished to the IRS.</TD>

backup withholding, (b)&nbsp;the Payee has not been notified by the IRS that such Payee is subject to
backup withholding as a result of a failure to report all interest or dividends, or (c)&nbsp;the IRS
has notified the Payee that such Payee is no longer subject to backup withholding, and (iii)&nbsp;the

proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of

after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an
appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw

merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares
not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal
have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement
shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10&nbsp;days after such stockholder&#146;s written request for such
a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10&nbsp;days after

stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by
1 or more publications at least 1&nbsp;week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general

advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and

the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by
certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon
of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such

proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any
rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall
determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be
paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court
shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines
otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of
payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal
Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period
between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application
by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the
appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior
to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose
name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f)
of this section and who has submitted such stockholder&#146;s certificates of stock to the Register in
Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section.

Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock
forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the
corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Court&#146;s decree may be enforced as
other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting

the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may
order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorney&#146;s fees and the fees and expenses of
experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal.

to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for
an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e)&nbsp;of this section, or if such
stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such
stockholder&#146;s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either
within 60&nbsp;days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection
(e)&nbsp;of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of
such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal
proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval
of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just;
provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such
stockholder&#146;s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation
within 60&nbsp;days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection
