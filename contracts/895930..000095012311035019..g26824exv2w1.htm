 D. The Company has received the Required Stockholder Vote necessary to approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, and has irrevocably delivered evidence of such Required Stockholder Vote to Parent and Merger Sub.

 Section 1.5 _Directors and Officers_. At the Effective Time, the directors and officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the directors and officers of the Surviving Corporation, to serve until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. 

  

 Section 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock and Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a) _Effect on Company Capital Stock and Company Stock Options_.

   #####

Each Post-Closing In-The-Money Option that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled pursuant to an Option Cancellation Agreement and converted into the right to receive the Per In-The-Money Option Consideration (as, if and when such amounts are required to be paid to the Post-Closing In-The-Money Options in accordance with this Agreement); and 

  

 (vii) _Out-Of-The-Money Options_. Each Out-Of-The-Money Option that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be cancelled pursuant to an Option Cancellation Agreement and will not be entitled to receive any Merger Consideration. 

  

 (b) _Effect on Merger Sub Stock_. Each share of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.7 _Surrender of Certificates_. 

  

 (a) _No Further Rights as Company Stockholders_. At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Capital Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) will automatically be cancelled and retired and will cease to exist, and no holder of record of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") will have any rights as a stockholder of the Company, other than rights to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. 

  

 (i) _Company Capital Stock_. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to Parent, together with a letter of transmittal in the form attached to this Agreement as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ "), duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions to the Letter of Transmittal, (A) the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash equal to the amounts required to be paid to such holder of such Certificate upon surrender thereof in accordance with _Section 1.6(a)_ (to the extent applicable) (as, if and when such amounts are required to be paid to such Persons in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement) and (B) the Certificate so surrendered will be canceled. Parent will, subject to the condition set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, cause the payment described in the preceding sentence to be made to the holder of such Certificate by check or wire transfer (as indicated in the Letter of Transmittal) of immediately available funds to the account designated by such holder in the Letter of Transmittal delivered with such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each outstanding Certificate that prior to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Capital Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all purposes, to evidence the right to receive the applicable amounts referred to in this _Section 1.7(b)(i)_ for each of such shares (subject to the provisions of this Agreement, including the provisions relating to the Escrow Amount and the Reserve Amount). 

  

 (ii) _In-The-Money Options_. Upon delivery to the Parent of an executed Option Cancellation Agreement, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions 

   ##### 

  

    

to the Option Cancellation Agreement, the holder of an In-The-Money Option
shall be entitled to receive cash equal to the amounts required to be paid to
such holder in respect of such surrendered In-The-Money Options in accordance
with _Section 1.6(a)_ (as, if and when such amounts are required to be paid
to such Persons in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement). Parent will, subject to the condition set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, cause the payment described in the preceding
sentence to be made to such Optionholder by check or wire transfer (as
indicated in the Option Cancellation Agreement) of immediately available
funds to the account designated by such holder in the Option Cancellation
Agreement, subject to the tax withholding requirements described in _Section
1.9_. 

  

 (c) _Transfers of Ownership_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed, and there will thereafter be no further issuances of or registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock on the records of the Company. 

  

 (d) _Escrow Agent_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent and Stockholders Representative will enter into the Escrow Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ with Regions Bank (" _Escrow Agent_ "), which will provide that Parent will deliver on the Closing Date to the Escrow Agent cash in the amount equal to the Escrow Amount. 

  

 Section 1.8 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate will have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Parent will pay to the record holder of such Certificate the consideration into which the shares of Company Capital Stock formerly represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to _Section 1.6_, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by such record holder and the delivery by such record holder of an agreement to indemnify (without any bonding requirement) Parent and the Surviving Corporation against any claim that may be made with respect to such Certificate. 

  

 Section 1.9 _Withholding Rights_. Parent and Surviving Corporation, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former stockholder or former holder of an Unexercised Option such amounts, if any, as Parent or Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the payment of such Merger Consideration under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of any other Legal Requirement. For administrative convenience, Parent and Surviving Corporation may tender payment with respect to any Unexercised Option to the Companys payroll provider to be paid to the applicable holder net of any applicable withholding. To the extent that amounts are withheld from the Merger Consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any former stockholder or former holder of an Unexercised Option as provided in this _Section 1.9_ and are properly paid over to the appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Former Stakeholder. 

  

 Section 1.10 _Appraisal Rights_. 

  

 (a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall take all steps necessary to comply with Section 262 of the DGCL. All notices delivered to the stockholders of the Company relating to Section 262 of the DGCL shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any share of Company Capital Stock that, as of the Effective Time, is held by a holder who has, as of the Effective Time, preserved appraisal rights under Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such share (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), will not be converted into or represent the right to receive Merger Consideration, and the holder of such share will be entitled only to such rights as may be granted to such holder pursuant to Section 262 

   ##### 

  

    

of the DGCL; provided, however, that if such appraisal rights will not be
perfected or the holder of such share will otherwise lose such holders
appraisal rights with respect to such share, then, as of the later of the
Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or the loss
of such rights, such share will cease to constitute Dissenting Shares and
will automatically be converted into and will represent only the right to
receive (upon the surrender of the Certificate or Certificates representing
such shares or the completion of the process described in _Section 1.7_) the
applicable Merger Consideration, without interest.

The Company will not make any payment or settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand unless Parent will have consented in writing to such payment or settlement offer, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each dissenting stockholder who, pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of the dissenting shares will receive payment therefor (but only after the value therefor has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such provisions). 

  

 Section 1.11 _Taking of Further Action_.

Former Stakeholder. 

  

 The Company, the Stockholders Representative (on behalf of the Former Stakeholders), Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company can rely on the Allocation Schedule as setting forth a true, complete and accurate listing of all amounts due to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company to the Former Stakeholders pursuant to this Agreement. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall have any liability with respect to the allocation of proceeds among the Former Stakeholders resulting from any payments made to such Former Stakeholders pursuant to the Allocation Schedule, and the Former Stakeholders hereby release Parent and the Surviving Corporation from any Loss relating to the allocation of the Merger Consideration pursuant to the Allocation Schedule. Following the Closing, the Stockholders Representative shall have the right to update the Allocation Schedule prior to the distribution of any Post-Closing Merger Consideration Amounts in order to accurately reflect how such Post-Closing Merger Consideration Amounts should be distributed to the Former Stakeholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and each Former Stakeholder, by execution of a Letter of Transmittal (or Option Cancellation Agreement), thereby agrees to cooperate with the Stockholders Representative, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the other Former Stakeholders in order to ensure that each Former Stakeholder receives its respective portion of any Post-Closing Merger Consideration Amounts which it may be entitled to receive pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. Each Former Stakeholder agrees that the Stockholders Representative shall have reasonable discretion in interpreting the Agreement and, absent manifest error or willful misconduct, such determination shall be binding on all Former Stakeholders.

The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Stockholders Representative agree to cooperate fully with the Accounting Firm and promptly provide all documents and information requested by the Accounting Firm so as to enable it to make such determination as quickly and as accurately as practicable.

 (e) _Earnout Consideration Procedures_. 

  

 (i) On or before the date that is 60 days following the date that is 12 months from the Closing Date, for purposes of determining Earnout Payment I, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative a reasonably detailed written statement (the " _Earnout Payment I Statement_ ") setting forth Parents good faith calculation of Center-level EBITDA for Earnout Period I. Such calculation of Center-level EBITDA for Earnout Period I will be derived from the unaudited financial statements of Parent and its Subsidiaries for Earnout Period I (the " _Earnout Payment I Financial Statements_ "). The amount of Earnout Payment I as calculated in the Earnout Payment I Statement shall be distributed from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the Former Stakeholders at the time such Earnout Payment I Statement is delivered, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Parent Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_. An amount equal to the sum of (A) the Earnout Potential _minus_ (B) the amount of Earnout Payment I (without reduction for any pending claims) shall be distributed from the Escrow Fund to Parent at the time such Earnout Payment I Statement is delivered, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (ii) On or before the date that is 60 days following December 31, 2012, for purposes of determining the Earnout Payment II, Parent will prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative a reasonably detailed written statement (the " _Earnout Payment II Statement_ " and, together with the Earnout Payment I Statement, the " _Earnout Statements_ ") setting forth Parents good faith calculation of Center-level EBITDA for Earnout Period II. Such calculation of Center-level EBITDA for Earnout Period II will be derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2012. The amount of Earnout Payment II as calculated on the Earnout Payment II Statement shall be distributed from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders Representative for the benefit of the Former Stakeholders at the time such statement is delivered, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and the Parent Indemnified Persons rights to indemnification pursuant to _Article VIII_. An amount equal to the sum of (A) the remaining Escrow Amount at the end of Earnout Period II _minus_ (B) the amount of Earnout Payment II (without reduction for any pending claims) shall be distributed from the Escrow Fund to Parent at the time such Earnout Payment II Statement is delivered, subject to the terms of the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 (iii) The calculations set forth on the Earnout Statements shall be prepared using the Earnout Accounting Mechanics, consistently applied throughout the relevant measurement periods. In preparing the Earnout Statements, the parties shall disregard any changes in (i) post-merger related costs associated with integration, rebranding or similar expenses, (ii) regional billing office billing methodology, (iii) Parent overhead charges and intercompany charges payable to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (iv) purchase accounting, (v) non-cash charges, and (vi) other charges associated with a change in accounting pronouncements or methodologies, made by Parent after Closing that negatively impact expenses at any surgery center operated by the Subsidiaries of the Surviving Corporation by more than $5,000 in the aggregate during an earnout period. 

  

 (iv) Within 45 days after delivery of the applicable Earnout Statement, the Stockholders Representative may deliver written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent of any objections that the Stockholders Representative may have to the applicable Earnout Statement. Such Objection Notice will set forth in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such objection together with 

   ##### 

  

    

the amount(s) in dispute. The failure of the Stockholders Representative to
deliver such Objection Notice within the prescribed time period will
constitute the Stockholders Representatives acceptance of the applicable
Earnout Statement as determined by Parent. Upon receipt of the applicable
Earnout Statement, the Stockholders Representative and its representatives
will be given reasonable access, during normal business hours, to all of
the Surviving Corporations books and records (including working papers,
schedules and calculations) reasonably relating to the preparation of the
applicable Earnout Statement. The Stockholders Representative and its
representatives may make inquiries of Parent and its respective
representatives and employees regarding questions concerning or disagreements
with the applicable Earnout Statement arising in the course of their review
thereof, and Parent will use reasonable efforts to cooperate in good faith
with and respond to such inquiries. 

  

 (v) Upon receipt of the Objection Notice within such 45-day period, Parent and the Stockholders Representative will attempt in good faith to resolve any dispute regarding the applicable Earnout Statement. If Parent and the Stockholders Representative are unable to resolve any disagreement with respect to the applicable Earnout Statement within 15 days following Parents receipt of the Objection Notice, then such dispute will be submitted to a mutually agreeable independent accounting firm (the " _Arbitrating Accountant_ "). If Parent and the Stockholders Representative cannot agree upon the Arbitrating Accountant, Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall each select one accounting firm and those accounting firms shall select the Arbitrating Accountant. The Arbitrating Accountant will be instructed to send to Parent and the Stockholders Representative, within 15 days of the date on which such dispute is referred to such Arbitrating Accountant, its determination of only the specific matters remaining in dispute which calculation will be based solely on written presentations made by the parties and in accordance with this Agreement (including the related definitions), and not on the basis of an independent review, and with respect to each individual item will be at or between the determinations prepared by the Stockholders Representative and Parent and will be final and binding on all parties. The parties shall promptly comply with all reasonable requests by the Arbitrating Accountants for information, book, records and similar items. The fees and expenses of the Arbitrating Accountant will be allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the Stockholders Representative, on the other hand, so that (i) the amount of fees and expenses paid by the Stockholders Representative will be equal to the product of (A) and (B), where (A) is the aggregate amount of such fees and expenses, and where (B) is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount in dispute that is ultimately unsuccessfully disputed by the Stockholders Representative (as finally determined by the Arbitrating Accountant), and the denominator of which is the total value in dispute, and (ii) the amount of fees and expenses payable by Parent will be the balance of such fees and expenses. 

  

 (vi) The additional Earnout Consideration in excess of amounts reflected on the Earnout Statements and paid to the Former Stakeholders pursuant to _Sections 1.15(e)(i)_ and  _(e)(ii)_ , if any, will be paid to the Former Stakeholders within five (5) days after the final determination of the applicable additional earnout payment pursuant to this _Section 1.15(e)_. 

  

 (vii) Parent agrees that from and after the Closing Date and until and including the expiration of Earnout Period II, Parent shall ensure that the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries have adequate capital as set forth in the Companys 2011 capital budget previously provided to Parent and working capital as otherwise needed to conduct its business in the ordinary course as currently conducted. The Former Stakeholders acknowledge that following the Closing, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall conduct the business of each Company Subsidiary in the ordinary course and may take actions that they, in good faith, believe to be in the best interest of such Company Subsidiary, even if those actions could have a negative impact on the amount of Earnout Consideration received by the Former Stakeholders as contemplated by this _Section 1.15_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the 

   ##### 

  

    

Surviving Corporation shall not take any action with the intent or for the
purpose of reducing the Earnout Consideration to be paid to the Former
Stakeholders pursuant to this _Section 1.15_. Parent agrees that
during Earnout Period I and Earnout Period II it will not cause the Surviving
Corporation to consolidate two or more Subsidiaries without the prior written
consent of the Stockholders Representative (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and Parent and the Stockholders
Representative agree that, in connection with any request for such consent,
Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall negotiate, in good faith,
with respect to an appropriate adjustment, if any, to the Minimum Center-
level EBITDA and Target Center-level EBITDA to reflect the proposed
consolidation. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation sells or
otherwise transfers all or a portion of its ownership interest in one or more
of the Companys Subsidiaries during Earnout Period I or Earnout Period II
such that the Surviving Corporation does not hold a direct or indirect
majority ownership interest in a Company Subsidiary, such Subsidiarys
portion of the Target Center-level EBITDA set forth on _Annex C_ shall be
deemed to have been earned for purposes determining Center-level EBITDA in
Earnout Period I or Earnout Period II (as applicable). In the event Parent or
the Surviving Corporation sells or otherwise transfers part, but less than
all, of its ownership interest in one or more of the Companys Subsidiaries
during Earnout Period I or Earnout Period II but retains a direct or indirect
majority ownership interest in such Company Subsidiary, such Subsidiarys
portion of the Target Center-level EBITDA set forth on _Annex C_ shall
be appropriately adjusted to reflect the change in the Surviving
Corporations direct or indirect ownership interest for purposes determining
Center-level EBITDA in Earn-Out Period I or Earn-Out Period II (as
applicable) and the Minimum Center-level EBITDA will be reduced
proportionately. The parties agree that Parent and its Affiliates do not owe
any fiduciary duty to the Former Stakeholders, but instead the parties intend
the provisions of this Agreement (including this  _Section 1.15_) to govern
their contractual relationship. 

  

 (f) _Preliminary Statements_. Within thirty (30) calendar days following the end of each full calendar month following the Closing through the month ending December 31, 2012, the Surviving Corporation shall prepare and deliver to the Stockholders Representative (x) the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries as of the portion of the applicable earnout period then ended (the " _Preliminary Financial Statements_ "), and (y) a preliminary statement (the " _Preliminary Earnout Statement_ ") setting forth the Surviving Corporations good faith calculation of Center-level EBITDA for each applicable earnout period (i) for such applicable fiscal month then ended and (ii) for the period beginning on the Closing Date to the applicable fiscal month then ended (until the end of Earnout Period I) and (iii) for the period beginning January 1, 2012 to the applicable fiscal month then ended, in each case, in accordance with the Earnout Accounting Mechanics. Within 15 days of receipt of the Preliminary Financial Statements and the Preliminary Earnout Statement, the Stockholders Representative shall review such statements and notify Parent in writing of any good faith material disagreement the Stockholders Representative may have with respect to the content of such statements. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall make itself and, as applicable, its employees available during normal business hours, upon the reasonable request of the Stockholders Representative, to discuss the Preliminary Financial Statements and the Preliminary Earnout Statements as well as any notices of disagreement provided under this  _Section 1.15(f)_. Failure by the Stockholders Representative to provide a notice of disagreement shall in no event prohibit the Stockholders Representative from providing an Objection Notice pursuant to _Section 1.15(e)(iv)_. The Preliminary Financial Statements and the Preliminary Earnout Statements shall be prepared in good faith based upon information known to the Surviving Corporation at the time of such preparation. 

  

 Section 1.16 _Closing Deliveries_. In addition to any other documents to be delivered under other provisions of this Agreement, at the Closing: 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) The Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Parent: 

  

 (i) resignation letters (in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent), effective as of the Effective Time, evidencing the resignation of each of the officers and directors of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that Parent has requested to resign as of Closing, executed by each such officer and director (or, in the event any such officer or director refuses to execute such resignation letters, evidence (in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent) of removal of such Person from such position(s)); 

  

 (ii) pay-off letters with respect to all unpaid Indebtedness (other than Center-Level Debt) of the Company, in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, providing for, upon the payment of all unpaid Indebtedness (other than Center-Level Debt) owed by the Company, the termination of all Encumbrances (other than such Encumbrances securing Center-Level Debt) held by the applicable lenders with respect to the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including the authorization of the filing by Parent of all necessary UCC-1 termination statements and other necessary documentation in connection with the termination of the lenders security interests), executed by the lenders;

constitute or give rise to a waiver by the non-breaching party of any
condition set forth in this Agreement, or to otherwise limit the remedies
available to the non-breaching party under this Agreement (whether prior to
or after the Closing). Not more than ten (10) days prior to the Closing Date,

 Section 4.8 _Cancellation of Option Awards_. Prior to the Closing Date and pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Option Agreements, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an option cancellation agreement with each holder of an Unexercised Option (each, an " _Option Cancellation Agreement_ "), which Option Cancellation Agreement shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to both parties and shall contain representations, warranties, covenants and other provisions consistent in all material respects with the Letter of Transmittal.

 Section 4.9 _Redemption and Amendment of Notes_. As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an Amendment to Subordinated Note with each of the holders of Companys Convertible Subordinated 

   ##### 

  

    

Notes listed in _Section 4.9(a)_. Such Amendment to Subordinated Note shall
be in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_. On or prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall give notice of redemption effective thirty (30) days
following the Closing Date to the holders of the Companys Convertible
Subordinated Notes listed in _Section 4.9(b)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule. Such notice of redemption shall be subject to the prior
review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. 

  

 Section 4.10 _Financing_. To the extent reasonably requested by Parent, the Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Affiliates and representatives (including legal and accounting advisors) to, reasonably cooperate with Parent in connection with Parents financing in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Financing_ "), including (i) timely providing financial and other information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries to Parents lenders (including information to be used in the preparation of an information package regarding the business, operations, financial projections and prospects of Parent and the Company) and (ii) cooperating reasonably with Parents lenders due diligence;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) such cooperation does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (y) any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred by the Company and its Subsidiaries at Parent or Merger Subs request in the performance of its obligations under this _Section 4.11_ shall be paid by Parent upon demand.

Parent agrees that any remedy at law for any breach by it of this _Section 4.11_ would be inadequate, and the Company or such Subsidiary would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case. If it is ever held by a court of competent jurisdiction that the restriction placed on Parent by this _Section 4.11_ is too onerous and is not necessary for the protection of the Company and/or such Subsidiaries, Parent agrees that any such court of competent jurisdiction may impose lesser restrictions which such court may consider to be necessary or appropriate to properly protect the Company and/or such Subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, "solicit" for employment shall not be deemed to include general solicitations of employment not specifically directed toward Key Employees or any inquiry made independently by any Key Employee.

If elected by employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries who continue employment and who have participated in the Company 401(k) plan, Parent shall cause its 401(k) Plan to accept distributions from Continuing Employees 401(k) accounts as rollover distributions subject to the terms of the Parent 401(k) Plan and the rules and regulations under Section 402(c) of the Code. 

   

 (c) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.3_ shall (i) limit or preclude the Company or Parent from amending or terminating any Employee Benefit Plan or (ii) amend, or be deemed to amend, any Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, this _Section 6.3_ is for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing contained in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person (including, without limitation, any Company employee or any representative, dependent or heir thereof), other than the parties hereto, any legal or equitable rights, remedy or claim hereunder or to amend or modify the terms of any Company Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 (e) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be responsible for any obligations and liabilities arising under the WARN Act due to Parents or the Surviving Corporations actions or omissions following the Closing, including with respect to any termination of employees of the Company following the Closing. 

   

 Section 6.4 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, the parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other and with their respective representatives and agents in connection with any steps required to be taken as part of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and the parties agree (a) to execute and deliver to each other such other documents, and (b) to do such other acts and things, all as the other parties may reasonably request, for the purpose of carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. 

  

 Section 6.5 _Consent of Stockholders_. Company will take all action necessary in accordance with applicable Legal Requirements and its Organizational Documents to solicit written consents from its stockholders to vote upon the approval of this Agreement and the Merger. All notices and other information delivered to the stockholders of Company relating to the solicitation of consents shall be subject to the prior review and approval of Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The Company will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Former Stakeholder to ratify the appointment of the Stockholders Representative pursuant to _Section 10.13_ hereof, and to provide evidence of the same to Parent.

 Section 6.7 _Indemnification, Exculpation_. 

  

 (a) All rights to indemnification or exculpation (including advancement of expenses) existing as of the date of this Agreement in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as provided in the Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years after the Closing; provided, however, that if any claims are asserted or made within such period, all rights to indemnification (and to advancement of expenses) thereunder shall continue until disposition of any such claims. Parent shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to, take any action to diminish or impair the indemnification and exculpation provisions existing in the Organizational Documents of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. The foregoing provision is a contract right in favor of the current or former directors, officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries and shall not be adversely effected by any modification to the Organizational Documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the date hereof. 

   

 (b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase, and after the Closing Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain, an extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance coverage for the directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries in a form reasonably satisfactory to Parent that shall provide such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured than the directors and officers insurance currently maintained by the Company. 

   

 (c) The provisions of this _Section 6.7_ are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Person entitled to be indemnification pursuant to this _Section 6.7_ , and each such persons heirs, legatees, representatives, successors and assigns, it being expressly agreed that such Persons shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.7_ and (ii) shall not be subject to amendment by the parties to this Agreement. The indemnification obligations provided under this _Section 6.7_ are primary and the indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.7_ shall not be obligated to pursue claims that exist under any other agreement or document which may provide such Person with any rights of indemnification or exculpation. 

   

 (d) Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby acknowledge that the Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.7_ may have certain rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and/or insurance provided by current shareholders, members, or other Affiliates of the Company or its shareholders (" _Indemnitee Affiliates_ ") separate from the indemnification obligations of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereunder. Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation hereby agree (i) that the Surviving Corporation is the indemnitor of first resort (i.e., its obligations to the indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.7_ are primary and any obligation of any Indemnitee Affiliate to advance expenses or to provide indemnification for the same expenses or liabilities incurred by the indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.7_ are secondary), and (ii) that Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitee Affiliates from any and all claims against the Indemnitee Affiliates for contribution, subrogation or any other recovery of any kind in respect thereof.

ARTICLE VII. 
 TAX MATTERS 

   

 The following provisions shall govern the allocation of responsibility as between Parent and the Stockholders Representative for certain tax matters following the Closing Date: 

  

 Section 7.1 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is necessary to determine the liability for Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for any taxable period of the Company and its Subsidiaries that includes (but does not end on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), the determination of the Taxes of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two (2) taxable years or periods, one which ended at the close of the Closing Date and the other which began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date, and items of income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment factors of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the Straddle Period, shall be allocated between such two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the books of the Company and its Subsidiaries were closed at the close of the Closing Date. However, (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation, and (ii) periodic taxes such as real and personal property taxes shall be apportioned ratably between such periods on a daily basis. 

  

 Section 7.2 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_. 

  

 (a) _Filing of Tax Returns_. Parent shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries that are required to be filed after the Closing Date and pay all Taxes shown as due on those Tax Returns. All such Tax Returns relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or a Straddle Period shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the past practices of the Company and its Subsidiaries, unless Parent reasonably determines that such past practices are not consistent with applicable Legal Requirements. Without the prior written consent of the Stockholders Representative (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), the Surviving Corporation shall not amend any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period. 

   

 (b) _Review Rights_. No later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing thereof, Parent shall provide the Stockholders Representative with drafts of all Tax Returns prepared by it pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)_, but only to the extent such Tax Returns would reasonably be expected to result in a Tax liability subject to indemnification pursuant to  _Section 8.2_ of this Agreement. The Stockholders Representative shall have the right to review and provide comments on such Tax Returns during the fifteen (15) day period following the receipt of such Tax Returns. The Stockholders Representative and Parent shall consult with each other and attempt in good faith to resolve any issues arising as a result of any Tax Returns described in this _Section 7.2(b)_. Upon resolution of all such items, the relevant Tax Return shall be timely filed on that basis. If any dispute with respect to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which Parent deems correct, without prejudice to any partys rights and obligations under this  _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_. 

   

 Section 7.3 _Certain Actions_. Parent covenants that without the prior consent of the Stockholders Representative, it shall not, and shall not cause or permit the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or any Affiliates of Parent, to make or change any material Tax election (including 

   ##### 

  

    

making any election under Section 338 of the Code), take any Tax position on
any Tax Return relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or compromise or settle
any Tax liability , in each case if such action would have the effect of
materially increasing the Tax liability (or Tax indemnity) or materially
reducing any Tax asset of any Stockholder in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax
Period. If Parent breaches the foregoing covenant, such Stockholder shall not
be liable for any Taxes that are a direct or indirect result of such breach.
After the Closing Date, Parent and its Affiliates shall not, without the
consent of the Stockholders Representative, agree to the waiver or any
extension of the statute of limitations relating to any Taxes of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or any Straddle
Period. 

 

 Section 7.4 _Tax Proceedings_. The Surviving Corporation shall promptly notify the Stockholders Representative in writing upon receipt by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries of notice of any Tax audits, examinations or assessments that could give rise to any indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_. Any such audit shall be treated as a Third Party Claim subject to _Section 8.6_. 

   

 Section 7.5 _Cooperation on Tax Matters_  

  

 (a) Parent and the Stockholders Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article VII and any audit, litigation or other Proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation shall include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such audit, litigation or other Proceeding and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Stockholders Representative and Parent agree (i) to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or the Stockholders Representative, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any taxing authority, and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if Parent so requests, the Stockholders Representative shall allow Parent to take possession of such books and records in lieu of destruction. 

   

 (b) Parent, the Stockholders Representative and the Company further agree, upon request, to use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be imposed in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby. 

   

 Section 7.6 _Transfer Taxes_. Any transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement shall be borne 50% by the Former Stakeholders (which fees the Stockholders Representative will pay to Parent) and 50% by Parent. 

  

 Section 7.7 _Tax Refunds_. Any Tax Refunds, less any expenses incurred by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary in seeking such Tax Refunds, that are received by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries within 12 months following to the Closing Date, or with respect to which Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary files a claim for refund within the 12 months following the Closing Date, that are attributable to any Tax period (or portion thereof) ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall be for the account of the Former Stakeholders and shall be forwarded by Parent 

   ##### 

  

    

to the Stockholders Representative on behalf of such Former Stakeholders
promptly upon receipt, except to the extent that such Tax Refund arises as
a result of a carryback of a loss or other Tax benefit attributable to a
period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, any Tax Refund attributable to the use of any Tax net
operating loss, capital loss or other carryforward in any Tax period
beginning after the Closing Date shall be retained by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or the Subsidiaries, as applicable. Parent shall, if the
Stockholders Representative reasonably requests, file or cause the relevant
entity (Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiaries of the Company
or any successor) to file a claim for refund for any Tax Refunds for which
the Stockholders Representative reasonably believes the Former Stakeholders
are entitled to a Tax Refund. The Stockholders Representative shall prepare,
or cause to be prepared, any such claim for refund. 

  

ARTICLE VIII. 
 INDEMNIFICATION 

   

 Section 8.1 _Survival_. All representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements in this Agreement, the Schedules attached hereto, the certificates delivered pursuant to _Section 1.16_ , and any other certificate or document (including any Letter of Transmittal) delivered pursuant to this Agreement will survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, subject only to _Section 8.5_. The right to indemnification, reimbursement, or other remedy based on such representations, warranties, covenants and obligations will not be affected by any investigation conducted with respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) about, the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with, any such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, no party shall bring any claim alleging a breach of _Section 4.4(b)_ against any other party following the Closing, and in no event shall the failure of any party to comply with the covenant contained in _Section 4.4(b)_ of this Agreement be asserted as a defense against any claim for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VIII_. 

  

 Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Reimbursement by the Former Stakeholders_.

 (a) Except as addressed specifically in another clause of this _Section 8.2_, any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in this Agreement, any certificate delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section 1.16(a)_, or any other certificate or document delivered by the Company at Closing pursuant to this Agreement, in each case disregarding the terms "material," "materiality," and "Company Material Adverse Effect"; (provided, however, that such "material", "materiality" and "Company Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and limitations shall not be disregarded in _Section 2.14(a)(xi)_ and the first sentence of _Section 2.19_ ); 

   

 (b) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement to be performed or complied with by the Company prior to Closing; 

   

 (c) that portion of Damages allocable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in connection with any written settlement relating to any Proceeding against the Surviving Corporation, any Company Subsidiary or any Parent Indemnified Person brought by a Governmental Authority after the 

  ##### 

  

    

Closing Date alleging a violation of any Healthcare Law that, if successful,
would give rise to or evidence a breach of any representation or warranty
made by the Company in this Agreement;  _provided_ , that for the avoidance
of doubt, the foregoing shall be subject to the consent requirements set
forth in _Section 8.6_; 

   

 (d) any breach of any representation or warranty made by the Company in (i) the first two sentences of _Section 2.1_ and (ii) _Sections 2.2(a)_, _2.4_ and _2.7_ of this Agreement, in each case disregarding the terms "material," "materiality," and "Company Material Adverse Effect"; 

   

 (e) payments made to stockholders holding Dissenting Shares in excess of the consideration such stockholders would have been entitled to receive pursuant to this Agreement had they not been Dissenting Shares; and 

   

 (f) any costs and expenses reasonably incurred (including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements and the costs of litigation and investigation) and any payments by the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates to holders of Unexercised Options who do not execute and deliver to the Company an Option Cancellation Agreement at or prior to the Closing, in connection with the cancellation of all Unexercised Options. 

  

For avoidance of doubt, the Company shall have no liability to, or obligation
to indemnify, the Parent Indemnified Persons from and after the Closing. 

   

 Section 8.3 _Indemnification and Reimbursement by Parent_. Subject to the limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and after the Closing, Parent shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the Former Stakeholders and their respective officers, directors, stockholders, employees, representatives, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons_ ") from, and shall reimburse the Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons for, any Damages directly or indirectly arising from or in connection with, incidental or relating to: 

  

 (a) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, the certificate delivered by Parent pursuant to _Section 1.16(b)_, or any certificate or document delivered by Parent or Merger Sub at Closing pursuant to this Agreement, in each case disregarding the terms "material" and "materiality"; and 

   

 (b) any non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation of Parent or Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation in this Agreement.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the obligation of the Former Stakeholders to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons pursuant to _Section 8.2_ is subject to the following limitations and qualifications: 

  

 (a) The Former Stakeholders will have no indemnification liability for any single Loss (or series of related Losses) that does not exceed $50,000 (the " _Mini-Basket_ "). 

   

 (b) The Former Stakeholders will have no indemnification liability under _Sections 8.2(a)_ through (c) until the total amount of Losses (other than Losses disregarded pursuant to Section 8.4(a)) incurred by the Parent Indemnified Persons thereunder exceeds $1,000,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which case the Stockholders will be responsible for the amount of the Losses in excess of the Basket. 

       ##### 

  

     

 (c) The Former Stakeholders shall have no indemnification liability for Damages under  _Section 8.2_ in an amount in excess of the amount remaining from time to time in the Escrow Fund, if any (the " _Cap_ "). 

   

 (d) The limitations set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of this _Section 8.4_ shall not apply to Damages pursuant to _Sections 8.2(d)_, _(e)_ and _(f)_. For avoidance of doubt, nothing contained herein (including _Sections 8.4(a)_ through _(c)_ ) shall limit or restrict any Parent Indemnified Persons right to maintain or recover any amounts from one or more Former Stakeholders in connection with any action or claim based upon any fraud committed by such Former Stakeholder (but no Former Stakeholder shall have any liability for the fraud of any other Person). 

   

 (e) All Damages relating to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 8.2_ shall be satisfied solely out of the amount remaining from time to time in the Escrow Fund, if any. In no event shall any Former Stakeholder be obligated to reimburse, replenish or make any further contribution (in cash or in kind) to the Escrow Fund following the Closing. 

   

 (f) In addition to the indemnification obligations of the Former Stakeholders pursuant to  _Section 8.2_, each Former Stakeholder that executes and delivers a Letter of Transmittal shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons to the extent provided therein.

 Section 8.5 _Time Limitations_. 

  

 (a) Former Stakeholders will have no indemnification liability for the breach of any representation or warranty or covenant set forth in this Agreement (or for any obligations under Section 8.2(c)) unless on or before the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Parent notifies Stockholders Representative of a claim or potential claim made by Parent in good faith specifying the factual basis of that claim or potential claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that any claim in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud, shall survive and, in each case, may be made by Parent at any time prior to thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. 

   

 (b) Parent will have no indemnification liability for the breach of any representation or warranty set forth in _Article III_, unless on or before the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date, Stockholders Representative notifies Parent of a claim or potential claim made by Stockholders Representative in good faith specifying the factual basis of that claim or potential claim in reasonable detail to the extent then known by Stockholders Representative;  _provided_ , _however_ , that any claim in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud, shall survive and, in each case, may be made by Stockholders Representative at any time prior to thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations period. 

   

 (c) Upon the giving of notice specified in _Sections 8.5(a)_ or _(b)_ , as the case may be, the indemnity with respect thereto shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this Agreement (regardless of when the Damages in respect thereof may actually be incurred), and the indemnitee shall have the right to commence legal proceedings with respect to any such noticed claim or potential claim subsequent to the survival date for the enforcement of their rights under this _Article VIII_. 

       ##### 

  

     

 Section 8.6 _Third-Party Claims_. 

  

 (a) Promptly after receipt by a Person entitled to indemnity under _Sections 8.2_ or  _8.3_ (an " _Indemnified Person_ ") of notice of the assertion of any claim against any Indemnified Person by a third party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), such Indemnified Person shall give notice to the Person obligated to indemnify under such section (an " _Indemnifying Person_ ") of the assertion of such Third-Party Claim, provided that the failure to notify the Indemnifying Person will not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any liability that it may have to any Indemnified Person, except to the extent that (and only to the extent that) such failure is demonstrated by the Indemnifying Person to have actually caused the Damages for which it is obligated to pay hereunder to be greater than such Damages that would have been payable had the Indemnified Person given the prompt notice required hereby. Such notice shall be accompanied by copies of all relevant documentation with respect to such Third Party Claim, including any summons, complaint or other pleading that may have been served, any written demand or any other relevant document or instrument. 

   

 (b) If an Indemnified Person gives notice to the Indemnifying Person pursuant to _Section 8.6(a)_ of the assertion of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such Third-Party Claim at its own cost and expense and, to the extent that it wishes (unless (i) the Indemnifying Person is also a Person against whom the Third-Party Claim is made and the Indemnified Person determines in good faith based upon the advice of counsel that joint representation would be inappropriate, (ii) the Indemnifying Person fails to provide reasonable assurance to the Indemnified Person of its financial capacity to defend such Third-Party Claim, or (iii) Parent asserts a claim against the Escrow Fund and the amount of Damages sought in the Third-Party Claim is greater than the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund), to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim with counsel satisfactory to the Indemnified Person, subject to the Indemnified Persons right to participate in such defense at its own expense. After notice from the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Person shall not, so long as it diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the Indemnified Person under this _Article VIII_ for any fees of the Indemnified Persons counsel with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Person in connection with the defense of such Third-Party Claim, other than reasonable costs of investigation or to the extent incurred at the Indemnifying Persons request in connection with its defense of the claim. If the Indemnifying Person assumes control of the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) such assumption will conclusively establish for purposes of this Agreement that the claims made in that Third-Party Claim are within the scope of and subject to indemnification, (ii) no compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims may be effected by the Indemnifying Person without the Indemnified Persons consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of any Legal Requirement or any violation of the rights of any Person; (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying Person or out of the Escrow Fund; and (iii) the Indemnified Person shall have no liability with respect to any compromise or settlement of such Third-Party Claims effected without its consent. If notice is given to an Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Person does not, within ten (10) days after the Indemnified Persons notice is given, give notice to the Indemnified Person of its election to assume the defense of such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Person can manage such Third Party Claim in accordance with the terms and conditions herein. Whether or not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

    ##### 

  

     

 (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an Indemnified Person determines in good faith based upon the advice of counsel that there is a reasonable probability that a Third-Party Claim may adversely affect it or its Affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages for which it would be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, or such Third-Party Claim involves any material matter beyond the scope of or in excess of the indemnification obligations hereunder, the Indemnified Person may, by notice to the Indemnifying Person, assume the exclusive right to defend, compromise or settle such Third-Party Claim, but the Indemnifying Person will not be bound by any determination of any Third-Party Claim so defended for the purposes of this Agreement or any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Indemnifying Person shall not be obligated to indemnify any Person pursuant to Section 8.2(c) in connection with any compromise or settlement effected without its consent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

 (d) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ : (i) both the Indemnified Person and the Indemnifying Person, as the case may be, shall keep the other Person fully informed in all material respects of the status of such Third-Party Claim and any related proceedings at all stages thereof where such Person is not represented by its own counsel, and (ii) the parties agree to render to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and to cooperate in good faith with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any Third-Party Claim. 

   

 (e) With respect to any Third-Party Claim subject to indemnification under this _Article VIII_ , the parties shall cooperate in such a manner as to preserve in full (to the extent possible) the confidentiality of all Confidential Information and the attorney-client and work-product privileges. In connection therewith, each party agrees that: (i) it will use commercially reasonable efforts, in respect of any Third-Party Claim in which it has assumed or has participated in the defense, to avoid production of Confidential Information (consistent with applicable law and rules of procedure), and (ii) all communications between any parties hereto and counsel responsible for or participating in the defense of any third-party claim will, to the extent possible, be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-client or work-product privilege. 

   

 Section 8.7 _Procedure For Indemnification  Other Claims_. Subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, a claim for indemnification for any matter not involving a Third-Party Claim may be asserted by notice to the party from whom indemnification is sought. 

  

 Section 8.8 _Calculation of Damages_. For purposes of calculating the amount of Damages to which the Parent Indemnified Persons and Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons are entitled under this _Article VIII_, the terms "material," "materiality," and "Company Material Adverse Effect" will be disregarded ( _provided_ , _however_ , that such "material", "materiality" and "Material Adverse Effect" qualifications and limitations shall not be disregarded in,  _Section 2.14(a)(xi)_ and the first sentence of _Section 2.19_). 

  

 Section 8.9 _Tax Benefit Offset_. To the extent an Indemnified Person recognizes any Indemnification Tax Benefit (as defined below) as a result of any Damages, the Indemnified Person shall pay the amount of such Indemnification Tax Benefit (but not in excess of the indemnification payment or payments actually received from the Indemnifying Party with respect to such Damages) to the Indemnifying Person within 60 calendar days of such Indemnification Tax Benefits being actually recognized by the Indemnified Person (to the extent such Indemnification Tax Benefit are actually recognized prior to the payment of the Damages, the amount of Damages shall be reduced by the amount 

   ##### 

  

    

of Indemnification Tax Benefit actually recognized). For this purpose, the
Indemnified Person shall be deemed to recognize an indemnification tax
benefit ("Indemnification Tax Benefit") with respect to a taxable year if,
and to the extent that, the Indemnified Persons liability for Taxes for such
taxable year, calculated by excluding any Tax items attributed to the Damages
for all taxable years, exceeds the Indemnified Persons actual liability for
Taxes for such taxable year, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributed to the Damages. 

  

 Section 8.10 _Remedies Exclusive_. From and after the Closing Date, except in connection with any action or claim based upon fraud, the remedies provided for in this Article VIII shall be exclusive remedy available to the parties hereto with respect to the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement. If any party or Former Stakeholder commits fraud, then only such party or Former Stakeholder who committed such fraud will be liable for such fraud and no party or Former Stakeholder shall be liable for any fraud committed by any other party or Former Stakeholder. 

  

 Section 8.11 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. Any payments made pursuant to the indemnification obligations arising under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all Tax purposes. 

  

 Section 8.12 _Mitigation_. The parties shall cooperate with each other to resolve any claim or liability with respect to which an Indemnifying Person is obligated to indemnify an Indemnified Person hereunder, including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate Damages. In connection with any Damages for which an Indemnified Person may seek indemnification under this _Article VIII_, such Indemnified Person shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue available insurance coverage that such Indemnified Person has in respect of such Damages and the amount of insurance proceeds actually received by the Indemnified Person, less any deductibles, shall not be included in Losses that such Indemnified Person may recover under this  _Article VIII_. Any out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) incurred by such Indemnified Person pursuing such insurance coverage shall constitute Losses for purposes of _Article VIII_. If the Indemnified Person receives any insurance proceeds subsequent to an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying Person in respect of such Losses and (a) the Indemnified Person has not been fully reimbursed for all such Losses by such indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Person, then the Indemnified Person shall keep the portion of such insurance proceeds necessary to fully reimburse the Indemnified Person for all such Losses and shall promptly pay the remainder of such insurance proceeds to the Indemnifying Person with respect to any indemnification payment made to the Indemnified Person up to the amount of the insurance proceeds so received by the Indemnified Person and (b) the Indemnified Person has been fully reimbursed for all such Losses by such indemnification payment from the Indemnifying Person, then such Indemnified Person shall promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Person for any indemnification payment made to the Indemnified Person up to the amount of the insurance proceeds so received by the Indemnified Person. 

  

ARTICLE IX. 
 TERMINATION 

   

 Section 9.1 _Termination Events_. By written notice given prior to or at the Closing, this Agreement may be terminated as follows: 

  

 (a) by Parent, in the event that following the date of this Agreement Parent obtains Knowledge of breaches of the representations and warranties of the Company contained in _Sections_  

  ##### 

  

    

 _2.5(b)_ , _2.11_ , _2.16_ or _2.17_ of this Agreement that would be
reasonably expected to result in Damages in excess of $7,000,000; 

   

 (b) by Parent, if the satisfaction of any of the conditions to Parents and Merger Subs obligation to close the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in _Section 5.1_ becomes impossible or otherwise incapable of cure by September 30, 2011 (other than through the failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with its obligations under this Agreement), and Parent has not waived such condition in writing on or before such date; 

   

 (c) by the Stockholders Representative, if the satisfaction of any of the conditions to the Companys obligation to close the transactions contemplated hereby as set forth in _Section 5.2_ becomes impossible or otherwise incapable of cure by September 30, 2011 (other than through the failure of the Company to comply with its obligations under this Agreement), and the Stockholders Representative has not waived such condition in writing on or before such date; 

   

 (d) by either Parent or the Stockholders Representative, if any Order of any Governmental Authority of competent jurisdiction permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise preventing the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby has been issued and becomes final and non-appealable; 

   

 (e) by mutual written consent of Parent and the Stockholders Representative; or 

   

 (f) by Parent or the Stockholders Representative, if the Closing has not occurred on or before September 30, 2011 or such later date as Parent and the Stockholders Representative may agree upon in writing. 

   

 Section 9.2 _Effect of Termination_. If the Agreement is terminated pursuant to  _Section 9.1_, all obligations of the parties under this Agreement will terminate, except that the obligations in _Section 4.11_, _Section 6_.1; _Section 6.2(a)_, this  _Article IX_ and _Article X_ will survive; provided, however, that termination of this Agreement will not preclude a party from bringing a claim against any other party to this Agreement for a breach arising prior to such termination or to compel specific performance by another party of its obligations under this Agreement. Nothing in this _Article IX_ shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any willful breach (but not any other breach) by such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement, to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by any other party of his, her or its obligations under this Agreement or to limit the right of any party to commence any Proceeding for improper or wrongful termination of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, such phrase "willful breach" shall be interpreted throughout this Agreement to mean that the "willfully breaching" party acted purposely with Knowledge that his or its actions were in breach of the terms of this Agreement. 

  

ARTICLE X. 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS 

   

 Section 10.1 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided by this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by the Company prior to Closing shall be paid by the Company (and, to the extent not paid by the Company or its Subsidiaries as of Closing, shall be deducted from the Merger Consideration as Transaction Expenses pursuant to the terms hereof), and all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by Parent and Merger Sub shall be paid by Parent. Notwithstanding 

   ##### 

  

    

the foregoing, Parent will pay one-half and the Stockholders Representative
will pay (from amounts in the Reserve Account) one-half of the fees
and expenses of the Escrow Agent under the Escrow Agreement. 

  

 Section 10.2 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. No party may assign any of its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties, except that Parent may assign any of its rights and delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement (i) to any Affiliate of Parent, and (ii) may collaterally assign its rights hereunder to any financial institution providing financing to Parent in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that no such assignment or delegation will relieve Parent from any of its obligations hereunder or require the other parties to this Agreement to resort to any such assignee or transferee prior to seeking any remedies against the assigning or transferring party permitted under or pursuant to this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will apply to, be binding in all respects upon, and inure to the benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Except as set forth in _Section 6_.8, nothing in this Agreement will be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement and the Former Stakeholders any legal or equitable right under or with respect to this Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, except such rights as will inure to a permitted successor or assignee pursuant to this _Section 10.2_. 

  

 Section 10.3 _Notices_. All notices, consents, waivers, and other communications under this Agreement must be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when (a) delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) sent by facsimile with confirmation of transmission by the transmitting equipment, (c) received by the addressee, if sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or (d) received by the addressee, if sent by a nationally recognized overnight delivery service, return receipt requested, in each case to the appropriate addresses or facsimile numbers set forth below (or to such other addresses or facsimile numbers as a party may designate by notice to the other parties):

 Section 10.4 _Entire Agreement; Disclosure Schedules_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes, Schedules and Exhibits attached to this Agreement and the other documents and supplements delivered pursuant to this Agreement) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, whether written or oral, between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof 

   ##### 

  

    

and thereof (other than the Confidentiality Agreement, which will remain in
full force and effect). No exceptions to any representations or
warranties disclosed on one schedule shall constitute an exception to any
other representations or warranties made in this Agreement unless its
relevance or applicability to information called for by any other Company
Disclosure Schedule is reasonably apparent. The inclusion of an item in the
Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a representation or warranty
shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item represents an
exception or material fact, event or circumstance or that such item
constitutes a Company Material Adverse Effect. 

  

 Section 10.5 _Amendment; Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. This Agreement may not be amended and any terms or conditions may not be waived except by a written agreement signed by the Parent, Merger Sub and the Stockholders Representative. Neither the failure nor any delay by any party in exercising any right under this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, and no single or partial exercise of any such right will preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right. The waiver, in accordance with _Article V_ above, of any condition based on the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or on the performance of or compliance with any covenant or obligation, will not affect the right to indemnification, reimbursement or other remedy based on such representation, warranty, covenant or obligation. To the maximum extent permitted by Legal Requirements, (a) no waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific instance for which it is given; and (b) no notice to or demand on one party will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of such party or of the right of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents referred to in this Agreement. The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and not alternative. 

  

 Section 10.6 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability; provided, however, that the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect without being impaired or invalidated in any way unless such invalid or unenforceable provision or clause is so significant as to materially affect the expectations of Parent and the Company regarding this Agreement. Otherwise, any invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced by the Parent and the Stockholders Representative with a valid provision which most closely approximates the intent and economic effect of the invalid or unenforceable provision. 

  

 Section 10.7 _Headings; Construction_. The headings of Articles and Sections in this Agreement are provided for convenience only and will not affect its construction or interpretation. All Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules to this Agreement are incorporated into and constitute an integral part of this Agreement as if fully set forth herein. All words used in this Agreement will be construed to be of such gender or number as the context requires. The word "including" shall be read as "including but not limited to" and otherwise shall be considered illustrative and non-limiting. All references to dollars or "$" in this Agreement will be to U.S. dollars. Unless expressly provided otherwise, all references to "ordinary course of business" shall mean consistent with past practice and custom (including, without limitation, with respect to amount, timing, scope, quality, quantity and frequency). The language used in the Agreement will be construed, in all cases, according to its fair meaning, and not for or against any party hereto. The parties acknowledge that each party has reviewed this Agreement with competent counsel of its choosing and that rules of construction to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party will not be available in the interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 10.8 _Execution of Agreement; Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this Agreement and all 

   ##### 

  

    

of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute one and the same
agreement. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and of signature pages by
facsimile, or by .pdf or similar imaging transmission, will constitute
effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the parties and may
be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes. Signatures of
the parties transmitted by facsimile, or by .pdf or similar imaging
transmission, will be deemed to be their original signatures for any purpose
whatsoever. 

  

 Section 10.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and any claims that arise out of or result from this Agreement, will be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to any conflicts of laws principles that would require the application of any other law. 

  

 Section 10.10 _Enforcement of Agreement_. The Company and Parent acknowledge and agree that the other party would be damaged irreparably in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by the Company or Parent could not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. Accordingly, the Company and Parent agree that, in addition to any other right or remedy to which the Company or Parent, as applicable, may be entitled, at law or in equity, it will be entitled to enforce any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of the provisions of this Agreement, without posting any bond or other undertaking. 

  

 Section 10.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LEGAL REQUIREMENT THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY PERTAINING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, WHETHER NOW OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY MAY FILE A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 10.11_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE KNOWING, VOLUNTARY AND BARGAINED AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO IRREVOCABLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY, AND THAT ANY PROCEEDING OR ACTION WHATSOEVER BETWEEN THE PARTIES RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY WILL INSTEAD BE TRIED IN A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION BY A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A TRIAL. 

  

 Section 10.12 _Independence of Covenants, Representations and Warranties_. All covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a certain covenant, the fact that such action or condition is permitted by another covenant shall not affect the occurrence of such default, unless expressly permitted under an exception to such initial covenant. In addition, subject to _Section 10.4_, all representations and warranties hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a particular representation or warranty proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that another representation or warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter is correct or is not breached will not affect the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation and warranty hereunder. 

  

 Section 10.13 _Stockholders  Representative_. 

  

 (a) Brazos GP Partners, LLC shall be constituted and appointed as agent (the foregoing person and any other person duly acting in such capacity as authorized hereunder from time to time, the " _Stockholders  Representative_") for and on behalf of each Former Stakeholder to give and receive notices and communications, to agree to, negotiate and enter into, on behalf of the Former 

  ##### 

  

    

Stakeholders, amendments, consents and waivers under this Agreement pursuant
to the terms set forth herein, to make and receive payments on behalf of the
Former Stakeholders pursuant to the terms set forth herein, to take such
other actions as authorized by this Agreement, including actions
in connection with the determination of the Estimated Closing Statement, the
Proposed Closing Statement and the Final Closing Statement, and to take all
actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Stockholders
Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing. Such agency may be
changed by a vote or written consent by the holders of a majority of the
Company Capital Stock on an as-converted basis as of the Closing Date, voting
in the same manner as would have been voted in accordance with the
Organizational Documents of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the " _Majority Stockholders_ "), from time to time upon not
less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent. If at any time the
Stockholders Representative resigns, dies or becomes incapable of acting,
the Majority Stockholders shall immediately choose another Stockholder to act
as the Stockholders Representative under this Agreement. No such resignation
shall be effective until a new Stockholders Representative shall be appointed
and have confirmed his acceptance of such appointment in writing to Parent.
The Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons may not make a claim for indemnity
against Parent pursuant to this Agreement except through the Stockholders
Representative, who shall make such a claim only upon the written direction
of the Majority Stockholders. The Stockholders Representative may enforce,
prosecute and settle any indemnification related claim without directions
from the Former Stakeholders or the Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons,
and all acts and decisions of the Stockholders Representative in connection
with such matters shall be binding on all the Former Stakeholders and Former
Stakeholder Indemnified Persons. No bond shall be required of the
Stockholders Representative, and the Stockholders Representative shall
receive no compensation for services provided hereunder, but shall receive
reimbursement from, and be indemnified severally by, the Former Stakeholders,
in proportion to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration received by
such Former Stakeholders, for any and all Damages or expenses incurred by the
Stockholders Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties
pursuant to this  _Section 10.13_, and, in addition to the foregoing, the
Stockholders Representative shall be entitled to offset the amount of any
such Damages and expenses from any amounts released from the Escrow Fund and
the Reserve Account upon its release to the Former Stakeholders prior to
the distribution of such funds to the Former Stakeholders in accordance with
the terms hereof. Notices or communications to or from the Stockholders
Representative shall constitute notice to or from each of the Former
Stakeholders. 

   

 (b) The Stockholders Representative will be entitled to engage such counsel, experts and other agents as the Stockholders Representative deems necessary or proper in connection with performing the Stockholders Representatives obligations hereunder, and will be promptly reimbursed by the Former Stakeholders for all reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances incurred by the Stockholders Representative in such capacity upon demand. Each Former Stakeholder shall indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholders Representative pro rata based upon such Former Stakeholders pro rata share of the total outstanding shares of the Company Capital Stock on an as-converted basis as of the Closing Date, from any and all Damages that are incurred by the Stockholders Representative as a result of actions taken, or actions not taken, by the Stockholders Representative herein, except to the extent that such Damages arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholders Representative. The Stockholders Representative shall not be liable to the Former Stakeholders for any act done or omitted hereunder as Stockholders Representative, excluding acts which constitute gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

   

 (c) All amounts received by the Stockholders Representative on behalf of the Former Stakeholders under this Agreement will be promptly paid by the Stockholders Representative to the Former Stakeholders in the proportions required under this Agreement; provided, however, that the 

  ##### 

  

    

 Stockholders Representative will be entitled to set off any amounts payable to the Stockholders Representative under _Section 10.13_ against amounts otherwise payable to the Former Stakeholders pursuant to this _Section 10.13_. 

   

 (d) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative in respect of any action under this Agreement shall constitute a decision of all of the Former Stakeholders and any other Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons, whether or not there was any prior consultation with or contrary instructions from any Former Stakeholder, and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such Former Stakeholder and other Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons, and Parent may conclusively rely upon any decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative hereunder as being the decision, act, consent or instruction of each and every such Former Stakeholder and any other Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons. Parent shall be able to rely conclusively on the proper distribution of such amounts by the Stockholders Representative among the Former Stakeholders upon receipt by the Stockholders Representative of such amounts. Parent is hereby irrevocably relieved from any liability to any Person (including any Former Stakeholder or any other Former Stakeholder Indemnified Persons) for any acts done by them in accordance with such decision, act, consent or instruction of the Stockholders Representative. 

   

 (e) The holders of two-thirds of the issued and outstanding Company Capital Stock (on a fully-diluted, as-converted basis) immediately prior to the Effective Time may amend this Section 10.13 from time to time following the date hereof and such amendment shall be binding on all Former Stakeholders. Any such amendment shall not be binding on and shall have no effect on Parent or the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 Section 10.14 _Reserve Account_  

  

 (a) The Stockholders Representative is hereby authorized to establish an account for the purposes set forth herein (the " _Reserve Account_ "). The Stockholders Representative is hereby authorized to use the funds in the Reserve Account, or, to the extent the Reserve Account has been satisfied, to use any remaining funds in the Escrow Fund that are to be released to the Former Stakeholders, to satisfy, to the extent there are sufficient funds therefor, (i) all costs, fees, expenses, liabilities or other obligations of the Former Stakeholders or the Stockholders Representative hereunder, (including, expenses of attorneys, accountants and other advisors), and (ii) any other obligations or expenses incurred by the Stockholders Representative in connection with the performance of its duties under this Agreement and the other agreements entered into in connection herewith. 

   

 (b) Any funds remaining in the Reserve Account as of the Survival Date (or, if any indemnification claims remain outstanding on such Survival Date, the date on which all such outstanding claims have been resolved) (the " _Reserve Termination Date_ ") shall be distributed to the Former Stakeholders, in accordance with _Section 1.6(b)_;  _provided_ , that the Stockholders Representative may in its reasonable discretion authorize the distribution of all or part of the Reserve Account prior to the Reserve Termination. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Stockholders Representative shall retain in the Reserve Account after the Reserve Termination Date, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, any amount that the Stockholders Representative deems in its reasonable discretion to be necessary to satisfy any costs, fees, liabilities or expenses or other obligations of the Former Stakeholders or the Stockholders Representative it expects to incur under this Agreement (whether on its behalf or on behalf of the Former Stakeholders) after the Reserve Termination Date or with respect to its defense or settlement of any unresolved actual or potential claims as of the Reserve Termination Date. Any 

  ##### 

  

    

amounts otherwise payable from the Escrow Fund to any Former Stakeholders may
be placed into the Reserve Account at the Stockholders Representatives
discretion. 

  

 Section 10.15 _Legal Representation_. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that OMelveny and Myers LLP (" _OMM_ ") may serve as counsel to the Former Stakeholders, on the one hand, and the Company and its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, in connection with the negotiation, preparation, execution, and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, OMM (or any successor) may serve as counsel to the Former Stakeholders in connection with any litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement notwithstanding such representation of the Company and/or any of its Subsidiaries, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation agrees that it will not request any files or records from OMM related to OMMs services as counsel to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement for purposes of bringing or advancing any claim or potential claim against the Former Stakeholders or the Stockholders Representative in connection with this Agreement or any other documents being executed in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 In connection with the proposed merger of AmSurg Merger Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Merger Sub"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of AmSurg Corp., a Tennessee corporation (the "Parent"), with and into National Surgical Care, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), pursuant to that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of April 7, 2011 (as amended or modified, the "Merger Agreement"), by and among Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, and Brazos GP Partners, LLC, solely as representative of the Former Stakeholders for certain purposes therein (the "Stockholders Representative"), the undersigned, being the registered holder(s) of the stock certificate(s) identified in the table above (the "Certificate(s)"), which represent all of the shares of Company Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, as applicable, owned by the undersigned (collectively the Company Common Stock, Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, Series C Convertible Preferred Stock and Series D Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company, the "NSC Shares"), encloses herewith, delivers and surrenders the Certificate(s). In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive, without duplication, the Per Common Share Consideration; each share of Series A Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Series A Preferred Share Consideration; each share of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Series C Preferred Share Consideration; each share of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any Dissenting Shares) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and shall be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Series D Preferred Share Consideration (collectively the Per Common Share Consideration, Per Series A Preferred Share Consideration, Per Series C Preferred Share Consideration and Per Series D Preferred Share Consideration the "Share Consideration"). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meaning set forth in the Merger Agreement. 

  

 The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated thereby. Holders of (i) seventy-five percent of each class of the Company Preferred Stock outstanding and (ii) a majority of the outstanding Company Preferred Stock (voting on an "as-converted" basis) and the Company Common Stock, voting together as a single class, have adopted by written consent pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") the Merger Agreement, thereby approving the Merger and the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Accordingly, the Merger Agreement has been adopted by all necessary action on the part of the Company and the stockholders of NSC (the "NSC Stockholders"). However, in order to receive your share of the amounts specified in _Section 1.6_ of the Merger Agreement, you will need to execute and deliver this Letter of Transmittal and Waiver of Appraisal Rights. For your information and convenience, a copy of the Merger Agreement is enclosed herewith. 

  

 Section 228 of the DGCL requires that prompt notice of the taking of corporate action, such as approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent of stockholders shall be given to those stockholders who have not consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would have been entitled to notice of the meeting. This Letter of Transmittal constitutes the notice required to be given to the NSC Stockholders who did not execute the written consents approving the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger, as required by Section 228 of the DGCL. 

  

 You as an NSC Stockholder have the right to seek appraisal of the fair value of your NSC Shares, as determined by the Delaware Court of Chancery, if the Merger is completed, and then only to the extent you comply with all requirements of Section 262 of the DGCL, the full text of which is attached as _Exhibit B_ to this Letter of Transmittal. The appraisal amount you would receive could be more than, the same as or less than the amount you would be entitled to receive under the terms of the Merger Agreement. If you intend to exercise such appraisal rights then you must, among other things, submit a written demand for an appraisal to the Company within the time period specified by Section 262 of the DGCL. Your failure to follow exactly the procedures specified in Section 262 of the DGCL will result in the loss of your appraisal rights. This Letter of Transmittal is intended to serve as notice to you, as a NSC Stockholder, of your appraisal rights, as required by Section 262(d) of the DGCL. 

  

 Because of the complexity of Section 262 of the DGCL, you should consult with your advisors, including legal counsel, in connection with any demand for appraisal. Any demand for an appraisal should be sent to NSC at the following address:

    |   | IRS Form W-9 or W-8: U.S. federal income tax law generally
requires that if your shares are accepted for payment, you or your assignee
(in either case, the "Payee"), must provide the Parent (the "Payor") with the
Payees correct TIN if you are a U.S. person (as defined in the instructions
to the enclosed IRS Form W-9), which, in the case of a Payee who is
an individual, is the Payees social security number. If the Payor is not
provided with the correct TIN or an adequate basis for an exemption, the
Payee may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") and backup withholding at a rate of 28 percent on the gross proceeds
received pursuant to the Merger. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Rather, the tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding will
be reduced by the amount withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment
of taxes, a refund may be obtained provided the required information is
timely furnished to the IRS.  
      
    |   | To prevent backup withholding, each Payee that is a U.S. person
(as defined in the instructions to the enclosed IRS Form W-9) must provide
such Payees correct TIN by completing the enclosed IRS Form W-9, certifying
that (i) the TIN provided is correct, (ii) (a) the Payee is exempt
from backup withholding, (b) the Payee has not been notified by the IRS that
such Payee is subject to backup withholding as a result of a failure to
report all interest or dividends, or (c) the IRS has notified the Payee that
such Payee is no longer subject to backup withholding, and (iii) the Payee is
a U.S. person (including a U.S. resident alien). If the Shares are held in
more than one name or are not held in the name of the actual owner, consult
the W-9 instructions for information on which TIN to report.  
      
    |   | Exempt Payees (including, among others, all corporations and
certain foreign individuals) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. To prevent possible erroneous backup withholding, an
exempt Payee should check the "Exempt payee withholding" box on IRS Form W-9.
See the W-9 Specific Instructions for additional instructions.  
      
    |   | In order for a nonresident alien or foreign entity to qualify
as exempt, such person must submit an appropriate and properly completed IRS
Form W-8, usually an IRS Form W-8BEN, signed under penalties of perjury
attesting to such exempt status. An IRS W-8BEN and other Forms W-8 may
be obtained from the IRS at its Internet website: www.irs.gov.  
      
    |   | TO PREVENT BACKUP WITHHOLDING ON PROCEEDS, EACH PAYEE SHOULD
COMPLETE AND PROVIDE THE PARENT WITH THE ENCLOSED IRS FORM W-9 (FOR PAYEES
THAT ARE U.S. PERSONS, INCLUDING U.S. RESIDENT ALIENS) OR AN APPROPRIATE IRS
FORM W-8 (FOR PAYEES THAT ARE NOT U.S. PERSONS, AND IN MOST CASES THE
ENCLOSED IRS FORM W-8BEN). CONSULT THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE ENCLOSED IRS FORM
W-9 FOR THE DEFINITION OF "U.S. PERSON."

 _Annex B_  

   

Section 262 of the Delaware General Corporation Law 

 

§ 262\. Appraisal rights. 

   

 (a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant to § 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of Chancery of the fair value of the stockholders shares of stock under the circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a stock corporation and also a member of record of a nonstock corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily meant by those words and also membership or membership interest of a member of a nonstock corporation; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in one or more shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is deposited with the depository. 

  

 (b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be effected pursuant to § 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to § 251(g) of this title), § 252, § 254, § 257, § 258, § 263 or § 264 of this title: 

  

 (1) Provided, however, that no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the agreement of merger or consolidation, were either (i) listed on a national securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving corporation as provided in § 251(f) of this title. 

   

 (2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to §§ 251, 252, 254, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything except: 

   

 a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof; 

  

 b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more than 2,000 holders; 

  

 c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a. and b. of this paragraph; or 

  

 d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the foregoing subparagraphs a., b. and c. of this paragraph. 

  

 (3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party to a merger effected under § 253 of this title is not owned by the parent corporation immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation. 

   

 (c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a provision, the procedures of this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is practicable. 

  

 (d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows: 

  

 (1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting, shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for notice of such meeting with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) hereof of this section that appraisal rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such stockholders shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for 

      ##### 

  

    

appraisal of such stockholders shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it
reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and
that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such
stockholders shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation
shall not constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action
must do so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days
after the effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or
resulting corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent
corporation who has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor
of or consented to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or
consolidation has become effective; or 

   

 (2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to § 228 or § 253 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section. Such notice may, and, if given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of mailing of such notice, demand in writing from the surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holders shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such holders shares. If such notice did not notify stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i) each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or (ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided, however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the sending of the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such holders shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given, provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the notice is given. 

   

 (e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such stockholders demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholders written request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a nominee on behalf of such person may, in such persons own name, file a petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this subsection. 

  

 (f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be borne by the surviving or resulting corporation. 

  

 (g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as to such stockholder. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value. In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good cause shown, interest from the effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of payment of the judgment. Upon application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such stockholders certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under this section. 

  

 (i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares, together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The Courts decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of this State or of any state. 

  

 (j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and the fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all the shares entitled to an appraisal. 

  

 (k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation); provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal of such stockholders demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party to withdraw such stockholders demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this section. 

  

 (l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

   lin-iiV *."(=*. I :-Jli: Page _2_ The person who g ives Form W-9 to the
partnership for purposes of eatabfahing its U_S_ status and avoiding
withholding on its allcc=ole share of net income from the partnership
conducing a trade or business in the United Stales- is in the following oases:
The U.5. owner of a disregarded entity and not the entity, The U.S. grantor
or other owner of a grantor trust and not the triEt, aid The U.S. trust
(other than a grantor trust] and not the beneficiaries of thetnBt Foreign
peraon. If-you are a foreign person, do not use Form W-B. Instead, use
the appropriate Form W-a (see Publication 515, Withholding of Tax on
Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.). Nonresident ilien who becomes a
resident alien. Gene-ally, only = nonre-aide1"! = en individual _may_ use the
terms of a tar treaty to reduce _of_ eliminate U.S. tax on DErtain types of
income. However, mos! las treaties contain a provision known as a "saving
clause.11 Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an Exemption
from tan to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has
otherwise become a U.S. resident aien for tax purposes. If you are a U.S.
resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause
of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of
income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following
five items: The treaty country. Generally, this musl be the same treaty under
w ch you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien. The treaty
article addressing the income. The article number (or location) in the tax
treaty that contains the saving clause anc its exceptions. The type and amount
of income that qiElifies for the exemption from ihx. Sufficient facts _la_
pEtffy the exemption from tax under the terms, of the treaty article.
_Example._ Article SO of the U^S.-China income tax treaty allows an exemption
from tax fcr scholarship income received by a Chinese student
temporarily present in the United Slates. Under U.S. bw, this student w
becone a resicent alien for tax purposes if his or her stay in the United
States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph _2_ or thefHt Protocol to
tine U.S.-China treaty (dated April SD, 19SJ) allows the provisions of
Article  _20_ to continue to apply even after tine Chinese student becomes, a
resident alien of the Unied States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this
exception (under paragraph _2_ of the flrat protocol and is relying on this
exception to claim an exemption from tax on his, or he* scholarship
or felcwship income would attach to Form W-9 a Btatemert that includes the
information described above to sifjport that exemption. If you area
nonresident alien or a foreign entity not subject to backup withholding, give
the requester the appropriate completed Form W-S. What is backup
withholding? P=rsol"5 m=ung certain payments to you must under certain
conditiona withhold and pay to the IRS a percentage of such payments. This e
called "backup withhold ing." Payments that may be subject to backup
withholding include interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker
and bartet exchange transactions, rerta, royalties, nonemployee pay. and
certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are
net subject to backup withholding. Youwil not be subject to backup withhold
hg on paymerts you receive rf you give the requester your correct TIN, make
the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends
on your tax return. Payments you receive will be subject to backup
withholding if: You do not furnish your TIN to the requester, You do not
certify your TIN when req lired (see the Part 11 instructions on page 3
fcr details), The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect
TIN, The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you
did not neper all your interest and dividends on your tax ratum (for
repcrtahle interest arid dividerids only), or You do not certify to the
requester that you are not subject to backup withholding under 4 above for
neportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 19B3 only). Certain
payees i~c pavments are exempt from backup withholding. See the instructions
below and the separate Instructions for the Requester of Fcnn W-9. Also see

The Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses shall be deducted fifty percent (50%) from the Escrow Funds and fifty percent (50%) paid by Acquiror fifteen (15) Business Days following delivery of an invoice therefore to the Acquiror and the Stockholders Representative unless the Acquiror or the Stockholders Representative objects in writing to the Escrow Agent Fees and Expenses within such fifteen (15) Business Day period. 

   

 (b) The Stockholders Representative (solely on behalf of the Former Stakeholders and in its capacity as the Stockholders Representative, not in its individual capacity) and the Acquiror, jointly and severally, hereby agree to indemnify Escrow Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or reasonable expense (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) actually incurred by the Escrow Agent, arising out of or in connection with its entering into this Escrow Agreement and carrying out its duties hereunder, including the reasonable costs and expenses of defending itself from any claim or liability; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Escrow Agent shall not be entitled to indemnification hereunder for losses, liabilities and expenses which arise out of the willful misconduct, gross negligence or material breach of this Escrow Agreement by the Escrow Agent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Escrow Agreement shall derogate from the indemnification rights or obligations of any party to the Merger Agreement.

so resigning may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Escrow Agent located within the territorial United
States and with capital and surplus comparable to the capital and surplus of

resulting appointment shall be binding upon all parties hereto. By mutual
written agreement, the Stockholders Representative and the Acquiror shall
