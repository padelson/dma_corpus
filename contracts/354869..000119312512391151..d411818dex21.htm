v AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of September 12, 2012 (this "
_Agreement_ "), is by and between FIRSTMERIT CORPORATION, an Ohio corporation
(" _Parent_ "), and CITIZENS REPUBLIC BANCORP, INC., a Michigan corporation
(the " _Company_ ").

RECITALS

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of Company with
and into Parent (the " _Merger_ ") upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the corporation Law
of the state of Ohio (" _Parent Corporation Law_ ") and the Business
Corporation Act of the State of Michigan (the " _MBCA_ ");

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent and the Company have
determined that the Merger is in the best interest of their respective
shareholders; and

 

WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

Article 1.

 

THE MERGER

 

 _Section 1.1 __The Merger._

Upon the terms and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Parent Corporation Law and
the MBCA, at the Effective Time, the Company shall be merged with and into
Parent. As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall cease and Parent shall continue as the surviving corporation of
the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

 _Section 1.2_ _Closing._

Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Article 7_ , the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of
Dykema Gossett PLLC, 39577 Woodward Avenue, Suite 300, Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan 48304 (or such other place as agreed by the parties) not later than
the second Business Day following the date on which all of the conditions set
forth in _Article 6_ are satisfied or, if permissible, waived (other than
those conditions to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver thereof), unless the parties hereto
agree to another date.

 



1 _Section 1.3 __Effective Time._

 

Immediately following the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by
filing certificates of merger (the " _Certificates of Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Ohio and the Department of Licensing and
Regulatory Affairs of the State of Michigan, in such form as required by, and
executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the Parent Corporation
Law and the MBCA. The Merger shall become effective at the date and time at
which both such filings have been completed, or at such later date and time as
Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger
(such date and time at which the Merger shall become effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").

 

 _Section 1.4 __Effect of the Merger._

At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this
Agreement, the Certificates of Merger and the applicable provisions of the
Parent Corporation Law and the MBCA. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise provided herein, (a) all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company shall
vest in the Surviving Corporation, (b) all debts, liabilities and duties of
the Company shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation, and (c) all causes in action of the Company shall continue
unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall accrue to the Surviving
Corporation.

_Section 1.5 __Articles of Incorporation; Bylaws._

 

The Parent Charter, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the certificate or articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by
applicable Law, subject to _Section 5.14.2_. The Parent Bylaws, as in effect
immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein or by applicable Law, subject to _Section 5.14.2_.

_Section 1.6 __Directors and Officers._

The directors and officers of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, subject to _Section 5.13.6_, be the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

Article 2.

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

_Section 2.1 _ _Conversion of Securities._

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

_Section 2.1.1 Conversion of Company Common Stock and TARP Preferred Stock.
_

 



2 _Section 2.1.1.1 _Each share of common stock, no par value per share, of
the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to
be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.1.2_) shall be converted into the
right to receive, subject to _Sections 2.1.4_ and _2.4.4_ , 1.37 shares of
common stock, without par value per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), of
Parent (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") (the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be received per share of Company Common Stock, the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each Certificate previously representing any such
share or Book-Entry Share shall thereafter represent the right to receive the
Merger Consideration into which such shares shall have been converted pursuant
to this  _Section 2.1.1.1_. No fractional share of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued, and in lieu thereof, a cash payment shall be made pursuant to
_Section 2.4.4_ hereof.

 

 _Section 2.1.1.2 _Each issued and outstanding share of the Company Fixed
Rate Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A (" _TARP Preferred Stock_
") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any shares of TARP Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.1.2_) shall be converted into the right to receive cash in an aggregate
amount equal to the liquidation preference of the TARP Preferred Stock, plus
all accrued, cumulated and unpaid dividends owing by the Company on such TARP
Preferred Stock.

 

 _Section 2.1.2 Cancellation of Certain Company Common Stock and TARP
Preferred Stock. _

 

Each share of Company Common Stock or TARP Preferred Stock held by Parent, any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, in the treasury of the Company or owned by
any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (other than shares held in trust
accounts or otherwise held for or on behalf of third parties in a fiduciary,
custodian or similar capacity where none of the Company, Parent or
their respective Subsidiaries is the beneficial owner) immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

 

 _Section 2.1.3 Parent Common Stock. _

Each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall remain outstanding immediately after the Effective
Time unaffected by the Merger.

 

 _Section 2.1.4 Change in Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock. _

 

If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any stock
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination
or exchange of shares, the Merger Consideration shall be
correspondingly adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination or exchange of shares.

 



3 _Section 2.2 __Company Options and Warrants._

 

 _Section 2.2.1 _The Company will take all actions necessary such that, at
the Effective Time, all employee or director options to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock that are outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Option_ ") will cease to represent
options to purchase Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically
into options to purchase Parent Common Stock; provided, however, that Company
Options will be converted such that: (i) the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock purchasable upon exercise of each Company Option will equal the product
of (x) the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were purchasable
under the Company Option immediately before the Effective Time and (y) the
Merger Consideration, rounded to the nearest whole share; and (ii) the per
share exercise price for each Company Option will equal the quotient of (x)
the per share exercise price of the Company Option in effect immediately
before the Effective Time divided by (y) the Merger Consideration, rounded to
the nearest cent. At the Effective Time, Parent will assume each Company
Option as so converted. At the Effective Time, Parent will assume each of the
plans set forth in _Section 2.2.1_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Company Stock Plans_ ").

_Section 2.2.2 _Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the exercise price and
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the
Company Options shall be determined in a manner consistent with any applicable
requirements of Section 409A of the Code and (ii) in the case of any Company
Option to which Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock purchasable pursuant to such option
shall be determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such
adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section
424(a) of the Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the
Effective Time, each Company Option shall continue to be governed by the same
terms and conditions as were applicable to such Company Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any rights resulting from
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, the applicable award agreements
thereunder and any applicable change in control agreement, including any right
to vesting or acceleration).

 

 _Section 2.2.3 _Unless purchased by the Company or Parent at or prior to the
Effective Time, the warrant issued to the United States Department of
Treasury (" _UST_ ") on December 12, 2008 with respect to 1,757,812.5 shares
of Company Common Stock (the " _TARP Warrant_ "), by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the holder thereof, cease to represent a
warrant to purchase Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically
into a warrant to purchase Parent Common Stock (the " _Parent Warrant_ ") in

 _Section 2.3.1 _All (A) shares of Company Common Stock, whether denominated
as restricted stock, salary stock or retainer stock granted under the Company
Stock Plans (collectively, " _Company Restricted Stock_ "), and (B) restricted
stock units granted under

 



4  the Company Stock Plans (" _Company RSUs_ ") outstanding, vested and
unrestricted immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any shares of
Company Restricted Stock and any Company RSUs that are required to vest, or
the restrictions upon which are required to lapse, after giving effect to any
rights resulting from the transactions contemplated under this Agreement
pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the applicable award agreements
thereunder) will be treated at the Effective Time the same as, and have the
same rights and be subject to the same conditions (including the conditions
set forth in _Section 2.4_) hereunder as, each other share of Company Common
Stock outstanding at the Effective Time as provided in _Section 2.1.1.1_.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any share of Company Restricted Stock or
Company RSU that constitutes, either in whole or in part, a deferral of
compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code, will instead be treated as
a vested right to receive consideration the same as, and with the same rights
and subject to the same conditions (including the conditions set forth in
_Section 2.4_) hereunder as, each other share of Company Common Stock
outstanding at the Effective Time as provided in _Section 2.1.1.1_, payable
when such share of Company Restricted Stock or Company RSU would otherwise
have been settled in accordance with its terms.

_Section 2.3.2 _All shares of Company Restricted Stock and Company RSUs that
are outstanding but unvested or subject to restrictions immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after giving effect to any vesting acceleration, lapse of
restrictions, or other rights resulting from the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plans and the applicable
award agreements thereunder) will cease to represent awards settleable in
shares of Company Common Stock and will be converted automatically into awards
settleable in shares of Parent Common Stock; provided, however, that such
Company Restricted Stock and Company RSUs will be converted such that the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be received upon settlement of each
such award will equal the product of (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock that were to be received upon settlement under the
applicable award immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) the Merger
Consideration, rounded to the nearest whole share. At the Effective Time,
Parent will assume each such award of Company Restricted Stock and each such
Company RSU, in each case, as so converted. Each such award shall continue to
be governed by the same terms and conditions as were applicable to such award
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any rights
resulting from the Merger and the other transactions contemplated under this
Agreement pursuant to the Company Stock Plans, the applicable award agreements
thereunder and any applicable change in control agreement, including any
right to vesting or acceleration).

_Section 2.4 __Exchange Procedures._

 

 _Section 2.4.1 Exchange Agent. _

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank or trust company
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") to act as
agent for Parent for purposes of, among other things, mailing and receiving
letters of transmittal, and distributing the Merger Consideration to the
CompanyÂ’s shareholders.

 



5 _Section 2.4.2 Exchange Procedures for Company Common Stock. _

 

At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this _Article 2_ , (A)
certificates representing the Merger Consideration issuable pursuant to
_Section 2.1.1.1_ in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock, and (B) from time to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay cash in
lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 2.4.4_ and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to _Section 2.4.3_ (such certificates
representing the Merger Consideration, together with such cash consideration
and such dividends or other distributions, being hereinafter referred to as
the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included
in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid only to Parent.
As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause
the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (A) a letter of
transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share to the Exchange Agent
and shall be in customary form) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share in exchange for the Merger
Consideration, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to this Agreement.
Following the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, properly
completed and duly executed, and upon surrender of such other documents as may
be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-
Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have been converted
pursuant to _Section 2.1.1.1_, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4.4_
and any dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section_ _ _ _2.4.3_ , and the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued
on the Merger Consideration or any other cash or other consideration, payable
upon surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry Share. In the event of a
permitted transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock which is
not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the Merger
Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to  _Section 2.4.4_ and any dividends
or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section_
_2.4.3_ may be paid to a transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share is
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to
evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable transfer
Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section
2.4.2_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time
after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such
surrender the Merger Consideration into which the shares of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall have
been converted pursuant to _Section 2.1.1.1_ and cash in lieu of any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holder is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.4.4 _and any dividends or other distributions to
which such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4.3_.

 



6 _Section 2.4.3 Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares. _

 

No dividends or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu
of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant to _Section
2.4.4_, unless and until the holder of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws,
following surrender of any such Certificate, there shall be paid to the holder
of the certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued
in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) promptly, the amount of any cash
payable with respect to a fractional share of Parent Common Stock to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4.4_ and the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock and
(B) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior to
surrender and a payment date occurring after surrender, payable with respect
to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock.

_Section 2.4.4 Fractional Shares. _

No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or other distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to any rights of a shareholder of
Parent. In lieu of such fractional share interests, Parent shall pay to each
holder of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time an amount in cash
equal to (A) the fractional share interest to which such holder (after taking
into account all shares of Company Common Stock held immediately prior to the
Effective Time by such holder) would otherwise be entitled, multiplied by (B)
the Average Price. As promptly as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional share interests,
the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent and Parent shall deposit such amount
with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional share interests subject to and in
accordance with the terms hereof.

_Section 2.4.5 Further Rights in Company Securities. _

All Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Company Common Stock and TARP Preferred Stock with respect to which such
payments are made, respectively. 

_Section 2.4.6 Termination of Exchange Fund. _

 

Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including any interest received with respect
thereto) which remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock
and TARP Preferred Stock for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to Parent upon demand, and any holders of Company Common Stock and
TARP Preferred Stock who have not theretofore complied with this  _Article 2_
shall thereafter look only to Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat
and similar Laws) as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger
Consideration,

 



7  any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which they
are entitled pursuant to _Section 2.4.4_ and any dividends or other
distributions with respect to Parent Common Stock to which they are entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.4.3_, in each case, without any interest thereon.

 

 _Section 2.4.7 No Liability. _

None of Parent nor the Company shall be liable to any holder of Company Common
Stock and TARP Preferred Stock for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the Exchange
Fund, or from Parent or the Company in the case of the shares of TARP
Preferred Stock, delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

 _Section 2.4.8 Lost Certificates. _

If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be
lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such person is entitled
pursuant to _Section 2.4.4_ and any dividends or other distributions with
respect to Parent Common Stock to which such person is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.4.3_, in each case, without interest thereon.

_Section 2.4.9 Withholding. _

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent or the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and
withhold under the Code, the UST regulations thereunder or any other provision
of federal Tax Law, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with
respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of Company Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent or the Exchange Agent.

_Section 2.5 __Stock Transfer Books._

 

At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers of Company Common
Stock and TARP Preferred Stock that were outstanding on the records of the
Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such Company Common Stock or TARP Preferred Stock, as applicable,
except as otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time,
any Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.

or is advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in Law or any

record or otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest

status of the approvals being sought, in each case subject to applicable laws
relating to the confidentiality of information. Each of the parties shall

Company and Parent shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any
actions, consents, approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from
parties to any Company Material Contracts or Parent Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Merger and seeking any such actions,
consents, approvals or waivers; provided further, that except as expressly
provided in  _Article 6_ , no such actions, consents, approvals or waivers
shall constitute

 



59  conditions to Closing. In the event that either party shall fail to obtain
any third party consent described in the first sentence of this _Section
5.9.2_, such party shall use reasonable best efforts, and shall take any such
actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to mitigate any
adverse effect upon the Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and
their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected
to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent.

 

 _Section 5.9.3 _From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time,

under this Agreement, subject to the limitations of the next sentence, Parent
shall cooperate in good faith with all Governmental Authorities and shall
take, or cause to be taken, any and all steps and make, or cause to be made,
any and all undertakings necessary in order to obtain any approvals sought

and every impediment asserted by any Governmental Authority under any
applicable Law, cause the expiration of any notice or waiting periods under

proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, order
or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, disposition or holding separate of assets
or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries
and (ii) accepting any operational restrictions or otherwise taking
or committing to take actions that limit any of ParentÂ’s, the CompanyÂ’s or
their respective SubsidiariesÂ’ freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain or freely operate, any of the assets, properties, operations
or businesses of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries.

the Parent Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall not be required, in connection
with obtaining any consents or approvals hereunder, or in connection with
otherwise complying with any provisions of this Agreement, to consent to or
take any action of the types described above that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to, in the good faith reasonable
judgment of ParentÂ’s Board, (x) materially and adversely affect the business,
operations, financial condition, property or assets of the combined
enterprise of Parent and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries or (y)
materially impair the value of the Company to Parent (taking into account,
however, in the case of this clause (y), any offsetting benefit to Parent and
ParentÂ’s Subsidiaries from taking any such action).

_Section 5.9.5 _If any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Law, each of the Company
and Parent shall, and shall cause their respective 

 



60  affiliates to, cooperate and use their reasonable best efforts to contest
and resist, except insofar as the Company and Parent may otherwise agree, any
such action or proceeding, including any action or proceeding that seeks a
temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction that would prohibit,
prevent or restrict consummation of the Merger or other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

imposed by any Takeover Law and each of them will take all necessary steps
within its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) those
transactions from any applicable Takeover Law, as now or hereafter in
effect.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided,
however, that no such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement; provided further, that a breach of this _Section 5.10_ shall not
be considered for purposes of determining the satisfaction of the closing
conditions set forth in Article 6 or give rise to a right of termination
under _Article 7_ if the underlying breach or breaches with respect to which
the other party failed to give notice would not result in the failure of the
closing conditions set forth in  _Article 6_ or would not result in the
ability of such non-breaching party to terminate this Agreement.

 

 _Section 5.11 __Public Announcements_.

Parent and the Company shall, as promptly as practicable but no later than the

length of service is relevant in any Parent Benefit Plan (but in each case
other than benefit accruals under defined benefit plans and supplemental
executive retirement plans), in which such Company Employees may be eligible
to participate after the Effective Time and only to the extent that such
service was recognized in a corresponding Company Benefit Plan as of the date

compensation pursuant to such Company Benefit Plans earned or accrued through,
and to which such individuals are entitled due to the consummation of the

ParentÂ’s publicly stated guidelines and qualifications for director nominees.

_Section 5.13.7 _Nothing in _Sections 5.1_ or _5.13_ , express or implied,
shall (i) amend, or be deemed to amend, any Company Benefit Plan, any Parent
Benefit Plan or any other benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or
arrangement, (ii) require the continued employment or service of any Company
Employee or any other person with any person or entity, (iii) except as set
forth in _Section 5.13.7(iii)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, prevent
the amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan, any Parent Benefit
Plan or any other benefit plan, program, policy, agreement or arrangement in
accordance with its terms or (iv) except as set forth in _Section 5.13.7(iv)_
of the Company Disclosure Schedule, create any right in any Company Employee
or any other person to any compensation or benefits or any other rights or
remedies of any nature or kind whatsoever.

_Section 5.14 _ _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_.

_Section 5.14.1 _At and after the Effective Time Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless all past and present directors, officers, employees and agents
of the Company (" _Covered Persons_ ") to the same extent such persons would
be entitled to be indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company
pursuant to the Company Articles, the Company Bylaws and indemnification
agreements in existence on the date of this Agreement with any Covered Persons
for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. At and
after 

 



63  the Effective Time, each Covered Person shall be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any Litigation with respect to any matters
subject to indemnification hereunder to the same extent such persons are
entitled thereto as of the date of this Agreement, provided that any person to
whom expenses are advanced undertakes, to the extent required by the MBCA, to
repay such advanced expenses if it is ultimately determined that such person
is not entitled to indemnification.

_Section 5.14.2 _For not less than six years from and after the Effective
Time, the Parent Charter or Parent Bylaws shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of Covered Persons than are currently set forth in the Company
Articles and Company Bylaws to the extent permitted by Law. Any
indemnification agreements with Covered Persons in existence on the date of
this Agreement shall be assumed by Parent in the Merger, without any further
action, and shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms.

_Section 5.14.3 _For six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall provide
to the CompanyÂ’s current directors and officers an insurance and
indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring on or
before the Effective Time (" _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable
than the CompanyÂ’s existing policies in effect as of the date hereof (the "
_Existing Policies_ "); provided, however, Parent shall not be required to
expend in any one year an amount in the aggregate that is more than 250% of
the most recent annual premium amount paid by the Company with respect to the
Existing policies prior to the Effective Time. In the event the cost of such
coverage shall exceed such insurance premium amount, Parent shall purchase
as much coverage as may be obtained for the insurance premium amount. Parent
shall be required to purchase the maximum "run-off coverage" or "tail
coverage" available under the Existing Policies; provided, however, that
Parent shall not be required to pay an annual premium for such "run-off
coverage" or "tail coverage" in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid
prior to the date of this Agreement, but in such case shall purchase as much
coverage as is available for such amount. If such maximum "run-off coverage"
or "tail coverage" does not extend fully to the required six year period,
Parent shall first seek the additional coverage from the CompanyÂ’s insurers
under the Existing Policies prior to seeking such additional coverage from
any other insurers. The provisions of the immediately preceding sentences
shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies have been obtained
by Parent or the Company at or prior to the Effective Time for purposes of
this _Section 5.14.3_, which policies provide such directors and officers
with coverage no less favorable than the Existing Policies for an aggregate
period of at least six years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including in connection
with the approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
provided such prepaid policies if obtained by the Company shall in each case
be subject to ParentÂ’s prior consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). If
such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder.

_Section 5.14.4 _In the event Parent (A) consolidates with or merges into
any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that (i) such continuing or surviving
corporation or entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.14_, or (ii) other
appropriate arrangements are made to provide for the obligations of Parent
and the surviving corporation under this _Section 5.14_.

 



64 _Section 5.14.5 _The obligations under this _Section 5.14_ shall not
be terminated or modified in such a manner as to affect adversely any Covered
Person without the consent of such affected Covered Person. The provisions of
this _Section 5.14_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Covered Persons and their respective successors, heirs and personal
representatives.

_Section 5.15 __Certain Tax Matters_.

At or prior to the Closing, the Company shall have delivered to Parent a
certificate complying with the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.1445-2,

 _Section 5.16 __Transfer Taxes_.

Parent shall pay all stock transfer, real estate transfer, documentary, stamp,
recording and other similar Taxes (including interest, penalties and additions
to any such Taxes) (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") incurred in connection with the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and the Company shall
cooperate with Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

 _Section 5.17 __Plan of Reorganization_.

This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of UST Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). After the date of this Agreement
(including, without limitation, after the Effective Time) subject to the
other terms and conditions in this Agreement, each party hereto shall take any
action that is required to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not take any
actions or cause any actions to be taken which could reasonably be likely to
prevent the Merger from qualifying, as a reorganization within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code. After the date of this Agreement (including after
the Effective Time), neither party shall take or cause to be taken any action
that could reasonably be likely to disqualify the Merger as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

_Section 5.17.1 _All parties hereto shall report the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code, unless otherwise
required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code.

_Section 5.17.2 _The parties hereto shall cooperate and use their reasonable
best efforts in order for Parent to obtain the opinion of Jones Day described
in _Section 6.2.3_ and for the Company to obtain the opinion of Dykema
Gossett PLLC described in  _Section 6.3.4_. In connection therewith, both
Parent and the Company shall deliver to Jones Day and Dykema Gossett PLLC
representation letters, dated and executed as of the dates of such opinions.

Upon the Effective Time, Parent shall assume the due and punctual performance
and observance of the covenants and conditions to be performed by Company

Supplemental Indenture, dated October 3, 2006, between the Company and U.S.
Bank National Association as Trustee, and (ii) the Indenture, dated as of
January 27, 2003, between the Company and JP Morgan Chase Bank, as Trustee,
relating to the 7.50% Enhanced Trust Preferred Securities of Citizens
Funding Trust I and the floating rate trust preferred securities of Citizens
Michigan Statutory Trust I, respectively (collectively, the " _Trust Preferred
Securities_ "), and the due and punctual payments of the principal of and
premium, if any, and interest on the Trust Preferred Securities. In
connection therewith, Parent shall execute and deliver any supplemental
indentures, and the parties hereto shall provide any opinion of counsel to the
trustee thereof, required to make such assumptions effective.

_Section 5.19 __Intentionally Omitted_.

 

 _Section 5.20 __Bank Merger_.

Upon ParentÂ’s request and contingent upon the Closing, the Company and Company
Bank shall cooperate with Parent to prepare documentation for a potential
merger of Company Bank with and into Parent Bank (the "Bank Merger"), in
accordance with the provisions of, and with the effect provided in, applicable
Law and to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under any

obtaining approval of all relevant Governmental Authorities. The Company, as

have caused the board of directors of the Company Bank to approve the Bank
Merger not later than five (5) Business Days after the execution of this
Agreement. The Bank Merger shall be consummated at or after the Effective Time
at such time as Parent shall direct. The Company and Parent will, as the sole

Upon the consent of the Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably or
delayed, taking into account subclauses (i) through (v) below for purposes of
determining whether such consent was unreasonably withheld or delayed), Parent
shall have the right to revise the structure of the Merger or the
acquisition, conversion, redemption or retirement of all outstanding shares of
the TARP Preferred Stock, _provided_ no such revision shall (i) result in the
Merger, for federal income tax purposes, not qualifying as a "reorganization"
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, (ii) result in any changes
in the amount or type of the consideration which the holders of shares of
Company Common Stock are entitled to receive under this Agreement, (iii)
impede or delay the consummation of the Merger in any non- _de minimis_
respect, (iv) result in the TARP Preferred Stock not having been retired or

reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

_Section 8.7 __Severability_.

 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to
the extent possible.

_Section 8.8 __Entire Agreement_.

This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the Disclosure Schedules and the
other documents delivered pursuant hereto) and the Confidentiality Agreement
constitute the entire agreement of the parties and supersede all prior
agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

_Section 8.9 __Assignment_. 

This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without
the prior written consent of the other party (which shall not unreasonably be

 _Section 8.10 __Parties in Interest_.

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each
party hereto and their respective successors and assigns, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, other than pursuant to _Section 5.14_ hereof
and _Section 5.13.7(iv)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, is intended to
or shall confer upon any other person any right, benefit or remedy of any
nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. The representations
and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the
parties and are for the sole benefit of the parties. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties of
risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of
the parties and may have been qualified by certain disclosures not reflected
in the text of this Agreement. Accordingly, persons other than the parties may
not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND
THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY

ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS
DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR
THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE

 _Section 8.13 __Disclosure_.

Each party hereto has or may have set forth information in its respective
Disclosure Schedule in a section thereof that corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates. A matter set forth in one section of the
Disclosure Schedule need not be set forth in any other section of the
Disclosure Schedule so long as its relevance to the latter section of the
Disclosure Schedule or section of the Agreement is reasonably apparent on the
face of the information disclosed in the Disclosure Schedule. The fact that
any item of information is disclosed in a Disclosure Schedule to this
Agreement shall not be construed to mean that such information is required to
be disclosed by this Agreement. Such information and the dollar thresholds
set forth herein shall not be used as a basis for interpreting the terms
"material," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or "Parent Material Adverse
Effect" or other similar terms in this Agreement.

 



89 _Section 8.14 __Counterparts_.

 

This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when
executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together
shall constitute one and the same agreement.

 

 _Section 8.15 __Specific Performance_.

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
