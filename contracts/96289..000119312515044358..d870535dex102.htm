below) and transfer to Buyer the Assumed Liabilities (defined below) and
Buyer desires to purchase from Sellers all of the Acquired Assets and assume
all of the Assumed Liabilities, in each case upon the terms and conditions

based thereon within fifteen days after such dispute is submitted and such
firm shall make a determination in a manner consistent with the definitions of
Inventory Value, Petty Cash, Assumed Consumer Liabilities and Credit Bid

and Petty Cash for the Acquired Stores and ( _b_ ) the amount of the Assumed
Consumer Liabilities as such firm may reasonably request. The determination of
such firm shall be final, binding and conclusive upon Buyer and Sellers

Credit Bid Consideration as finally determined hereunder and pursuant to

such excess against the amount of debt under the Credit Facilities held by
Buyer as of such time, _provided_ that if the amount of debt under the Credit
Facilities held by Buyer as of such time is insufficient to cover such excess,
then such shortfall amount shall instead be payable by Buyer in cash by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account or accounts specified
by the Sellers;

(ii) if the Estimated Credit Bid Consideration exceeds the Final Credit Bid
Consideration (the " _Adjustment Amount_ "), then ( _A_ ) if the amount of

the definition of Cash Consideration, an amount equal to the Adjustment
Amount will be released from the Escrow Account to Buyer as provided below
and, to the extent the amount in the Escrow Account prior to such release is
less than the Adjustment Amount, Sellers shall pay to Buyer an amount equal
to the amount by which the Adjustment Amount exceeds the amount in the Escrow

Schedule(s), and neither Buyer nor any Seller shall agree to any proposed
adjustment based upon or arising out of Allocation Schedule(s) by
any Governmental Authority without first giving the other Party prior written
notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained herein shall prevent
Buyer or any Seller from settling any proposed deficiency or adjustment by
any Governmental Authority based upon or arising out of the Allocation
Schedule(s), and neither Buyer nor any Seller shall be required to litigate
before any court any proposed deficiency or adjustment by any Governmental
Authority based upon or arising out of such Allocation Schedule(s).

Governmental Authority) shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to Sellers.

_b_ ) the certificate incorporation of Buyer, ( _c_ ) any Order or ( _d_ )
any Law.

Section 6.4 _Availability of Funds; Solvency_.

Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is in full force and effect and
is a valid and binding obligation of Buyer subject to the terms and conditions

or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become
absolute and matured.

of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for which Sellers are or

from any claims with respect to any such fees or commissions.

Section 6.7 _Condition of Acquired Assets; Representations_. Notwithstanding
anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary (but without limiting in
any manner _Section 7.10_ or _Section 9.10_ ), Buyer acknowledges and agrees

investigation. In connection with Buyers investigation, Buyer has received or

other forecasts and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that
there are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates,
projections and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such

or its authorized Representatives, and ( _c_ ) use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause their outside accountants and outside counsel to cooperate
with Buyer in its investigation; _provided_ that Buyer shall submit to Sellers
requests for such access, information or cooperation, including reasonable
detail regarding the requested access, information or cooperation, a
reasonable period in advance of the time at which such access, information or
cooperation is to be provided, and all such requests shall be submitted only
to the individual designated in writing by Sellers as Sellers designated
representative, or to such other individuals as such designated individual may
designate from time to time to receive such requests (" _Sellers  Interim
Access Manager_"). Such requests of Buyer shall be submitted only by the
individual designated in writing by Buyer or another individual reasonably
acceptable to Sellers Interim Access Manager as successor thereto,
as Buyers designated representative (" _Buyer s Interim Access Manager_").
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no such access, information
or cooperation shall be permitted or required to the extent that it
would require Sellers to disclose information subject to attorney-client
privilege or would be prohibited by Law or would otherwise contravene any
antitrust or competition Law.

 

(b) After the Effective Date and prior to the Closing Date, Sellers shall, and
shall cause their Subsidiaries to, promptly following Buyers request, seek
and use their respective reasonable best efforts to arrange such meetings and
telephone conferences with material suppliers and vendors of Sellers and their
Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer and necessary and
appropriate for the Buyer to coordinate transition of such suppliers and
vendors to the Business following the Closing.

 

Section 7.2 _Operations Prior to the Closing Date_. Sellers covenant and agree
that, except ( _i_ ) as expressly contemplated by this Agreement, ( _ii_ ) as
disclosed in _Schedule 7.2_ , ( _iii_ ) with the prior written consent of
Buyer (which consent, other than with respect to _Section 7.2(b)(ii)_, shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), ( _iv_ ) as required by the
Bankruptcy Court or ( _v_ ) as otherwise required by Law, after the Effective
Date and prior to the Closing Date:

 

(a) Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, taking into account
Sellers status as debtors-in-possession in the Bankruptcy Case, to carry on
the Business in the Ordinary Course of Business, to maintain in full force and
effect the Permits, to maintain and preserve the Acquired Assets in their
present condition (including by using its reasonable best efforts to renew
any Assigned Agreements that come up for renewal in the Ordinary Course of
Business), other than reasonable wear and tear and sales of Inventory in the
Ordinary Course of Business, and to keep intact the business relationships
relating to the Acquired Stores and the Acquired Assets; and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing,

(b) Sellers shall not:

 

(i) other than the sale of Inventory in the Ordinary Course of Business, any
Permitted Inventory Reduction or pursuant to any debtor-in-possession
financing or cash collateral agreement or order, sell, lease (as lessor),
transfer (including the transfer from

 



29  an Acquired Store to a non-Acquired Store) or otherwise dispose of, or
mortgage or pledge, or voluntarily impose or suffer to be imposed any
Encumbrance (other than Assumed Liabilities and Permitted Encumbrances) on,
any Acquired Asset;

(ii) amend, modify, terminate, waive any rights under or create
any Encumbrance with respect to, any of the Assigned Agreements or otherwise
take any actions not required by the terms of any Assigned Agreement that
would result in any increase in any payments to be made under such Assigned
Agreement;

 

(iii) except in the Ordinary Course of Business, cancel or compromise any
material claim or waive or release any material right, in each case, that is
a claim or right related to an Acquired Asset; or

(iv) enter into any agreement or commitment to take any action prohibited by
this _Section 7.2_.

(c) Sellers shall cause each Acquired Store to have a sufficient amount
of Petty Cash as of the Closing to conduct its operations in the Ordinary
Course of Business following the Closing.

(d) Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause the level,
composition and mix of Inventory at each Acquired Store to be consistent with
the Projected Inventory for such Acquired Store and the saleable condition of
such Inventory as of the Closing to be consistent with the saleable condition
of such Inventory as of the date of this Agreement.

(e) Without in any way limiting any Partys rights or obligations under this
Agreement, the Parties understand and agree that ( _i_ ) nothing contained in
this Agreement shall give Buyer, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of Sellers or the Business prior to the Closing and
( _ii_ ) prior to the Closing, Sellers shall exercise, consistent with, and
subject to, the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over the Business and their operations to the extent permitted by
Law, including taking into account Sellers status as debtors-in-possession in
the Bankruptcy Case. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Sellers
shall be permitted to take all actions that are necessary or desirable to
comply with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act and WARN
Act, including providing any notices required under the WARN Act, and no such
actions shall constitute a violation of this _Section 7.2_.

 

Section 7.3 _HSR Act; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.3(c)_, as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Date, Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall
each prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed, any notifications
required to be filed under the HSR Act with the United States Federal Trade
Commission (the " _FTC_ ") and the Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), if
applicable, and request early termination of the waiting period under the HSR
Act. Buyer, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall as soon as
reasonably practicable respond to any requests for additional information in
connection with such filings and shall take all other actions necessary to
cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the
earliest practicable date after the date of filing. Buyer shall be responsible
for payment of the applicable filing fee under the HSR Act.

 



30 (b) In addition to the actions to be taken under _Section 7.3(a)_, Sellers,
on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner reasonably practicable, the transactions
contemplated hereby, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the
following: ( _i_ ) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the
conditions precedent set forth in _Article IX_ and _Article X_ to be
satisfied, ( _ii_ ) the obtaining of all necessary Governmental Authorizations
and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings
(including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to avoid
any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority, ( _iii_ ) the defending of any
Proceedings challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transaction
contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary
restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Authority
vacated or reversed, and ( _iv_ ) the execution or delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting
the foregoing, each Seller shall cause any applicable Retained Subsidiary
that holds any Purchased Assets to transfer such Purchased Assets to a Seller
prior to the Closing.

 

(c) If required by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Authority in order
to obtain clearance under or to terminate any waiting period required by the
HSR Act or to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any Order
that would have the effect of preventing or delaying the Closing beyond the
Outside Date, Buyer will propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and
if such offer is accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold
separate Order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of Acquired
Assets or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to take any action which
it is capable of taking (collectively, a " _Divestiture Action_ "), and if
the offer is accepted, take or commit to take, such action. Buyer will
promptly advise Sellers of any Divestiture Action required by the FTC, the DOJ
or other Governmental Authority and any negotiations with respect thereto.
For purposes of this _Section 7.3_, a Divestiture Action will be considered
"required" by the FTC, the DOJ or other Governmental Authority only if and to
the extent that Buyer has been notified by the FTC, the DOJ, or such other
Governmental Authority that the failure or refusal to take such Divestiture
Action would result in the filing of Proceedings seeking an Order that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(d) Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, ( _i_ )
shall promptly inform each other of any communication from any Governmental
Authority concerning this Agreement, the transactions contemplated hereby, and
any filing, notification or request for approval and ( _ii_ ) shall permit the
other to review in advance any proposed written or material oral
communication or information submitted to any such Governmental Authority in
response thereto and shall discuss and attempt to reasonably account for any
comments or suggestions of the other Party (in each case excluding any
portions thereof that contain confidential information). In addition, none of
Parties shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry with
respect to this Agreement or the

 



31  transactions contemplated hereby, unless such Party consults with the other
Parties in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by any such Governmental
Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate
thereat, in each case to the maximum extent practicable. Subject to any
restrictions under applicable laws, rules or regulations, Buyer, on the one
hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, shall furnish the other with copies of
all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda setting forth
the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their respective
Representatives on the one hand, and the Governmental Authority or members of
its staff on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby (excluding documents and communications which are subject
to preexisting confidentiality agreements or to the attorney-client privilege
or work product doctrine) or any such filing, notification or request for
approval (in each case excluding any portions thereof that contain
confidential information). In carrying out their obligations under this
_Section 7.3_, subject to applicable Law, each of the Parties shall not
submit or otherwise provide any information to such Governmental Authority
without first having provided a reasonable opportunity to the other Party and
its counsel to comment upon such information. Each Party shall also furnish
the other Party with such necessary information and assistance as such other
Party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registration or submissions of information
to the Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement, the
transactions contemplated hereby and any such filing, notification or request
for approval. Any Party may, as it deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any sensitive material provided to the other Party under this
_Section 7.3_, or otherwise pursuant to this Agreement, as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to the outside legal counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed
by such outside counsel to the directors, officers or employees of the
recipient, unless express written permission is obtained in advance from the
source of the materials.

 

(e) Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall, after the entry of the Sale Order, enter
into any agreement that would have the effect of delaying the consummation of
any action contemplated by this Agreement without the written consent of the
other Party. For the avoidance of doubt, no Party shall commit to or agree
with any Governmental Authority to stay, toll or extend any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act or other applicable Laws, without the prior
written consent of the other Parties.

Section 7.4 _Bankruptcy Court Filings and Approval_.

(a) Sellers shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain entry of
the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order and such other relief from
the Bankruptcy Court as may be necessary or appropriate in connection with
this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Sellers shall file with the Bankruptcy Court, on or prior to the
end of the second (2nd) Business Day following the later of the Filing or
execution of this Agreement, the motion seeking entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order and the Sale Order authorizing Sellers to enter into this
Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereunder. Buyer
agrees that it will promptly take such actions as are reasonably requested by
Sellers to assist in obtaining entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the
Sale Order and, consistent with _Section 8.3(a)_ below, a finding by the
Bankruptcy Court of adequate assurance of future performance by Buyer.

 



32 (b) Prior to the filing by Sellers of the motion contemplated by the second
sentence of  _Section 7.4(a)_, Sellers will ( _i_ ) provide a copy thereof
(including, in each case, the related forms of order and notice and supporting
materials) to Buyer and its counsel, ( _ii_ ) provide Buyer and its counsel
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document, and any
amendment or supplement thereto, and ( _iii_ ) incorporate any reasonable
comments of Buyer and its counsel into such document and any amendment or
supplement thereto. 

(c) Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that this Agreement and the sale of the
Acquired Assets and the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Agreements
are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval. Sellers and Buyer acknowledge that (
_i_ ) to obtain such approval, Sellers must demonstrate that they have taken
reasonable steps to obtain the highest or otherwise best offer possible for
the Acquired Assets and ( _ii_ ) Buyer must provide adequate assurance of
future performance under the Assigned Agreements to be assigned by Sellers.

 

(d) Sellers shall give all notices required to be given by applicable Law, to
all Persons entitled thereto, of all motions (including the motions seeking
entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order), orders, hearings
and other proceedings relating to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby and such additional notice as ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court or as Buyer may reasonably request. Sellers shall promptly
provide Buyer with copies of all communications from the Bankruptcy Court or
third parties relating to the motions seeking entry of the Bidding Procedures
Order and the Sale Order. 

(e) In the event an appeal is taken or a stay pending appeal is requested,
from the Bidding Procedures Order or the Sale Order, Sellers shall
immediately notify Buyer of such appeal or stay request and shall provide to
Buyer promptly a copy of the related notice of appeal or order of stay.
Sellers shall also provide Buyer with written notice of any motion or
application filed in connection with any appeal from or stay request in
respect of either of such orders. Sellers and Buyer shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such appeal or stay request and
obtain an expedited resolution of such appeal.

(f) After entry of the Sale Order, to the extent Buyer is the Successful
Bidder at the Auction, Sellers shall not take any action which is intended
to, or fail to take any action the intent of which failure to act is to,
result in the reversal, voiding, modification or staying of the Sale Order.

 

(g) Within three Business Days following the Filing, Sellers shall file a
motion, in form and substantive satisfactory to Buyer, seeking entry of an
order determining Cure Costs in connection with the Sellers assignment and
assumption of the Assigned Agreements. The Sellers shall schedule the hearing
on such motion not later than 30 days after the Filing.

 

Section 7.5 _Bidding Procedures_. The bidding procedures to be employed with
respect to this Agreement shall be those reflected in the Bidding Procedures
Order. Buyer agrees and acknowledges that Sellers and their Representatives
and Affiliates are and may continue soliciting inquiries, proposals or offers
for the Acquired Assets in connection with any alternative
transaction pursuant to the terms of the Bidding Procedures Order.

 



33 Section 7.6 _Break-Up Fee; Expense Reimbursement Amount_.

 

(a) Subject to ( _x_ ) the delivery by Buyer to Sellers of a Debt Financing
Commitment in a form reasonably satisfactory to Sellers and ( _y_ ) entry of
the Bidding Procedures Order, if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
_Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section 11.1(b)(i)_, _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_,
_Section 11.1(c)(ii)_ or  _Section 11.1(c)(iii)_ and, in each case, Sellers
consummate an Alternative Transaction within nine months after such
termination, then Sellers, jointly and severally, shall, subject to _Section
7.6(c)_, pay in cash to Buyer, on the date of the consummation of the
Alternative Transaction and from the proceeds of the Alternative Transaction,
a break-up fee in the amount of $6,000,000 (the " _Break-Up Fee_ "), by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Buyer to
Sellers in writing.

(b) Subject to entry of the Bidding Procedures Order, if this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to _Section 11.1(a)(i)_ (unless due to Buyers breach
of this Agreement), _Section 11.1(a)(iii)_, _Section 11.1(a)(iv)_, _Section
11.1(b)(i)_, _Section 11.1(b)(iii)_,  _Section 11.1(c)(ii)_ or _Section
11.1(c)(iii)_, then Sellers, jointly and severally, shall, subject to _Section
7.6(c)_, pay in cash to Buyer, within five (5) Business Days of such
termination, an amount equal to the reasonable and documented costs, fees and
expenses incurred by Buyer and its Affiliates (including fees and expenses of
legal, accounting and financial advisors and any filing fee under the HSR Act
paid by Buyer or its Affiliates) in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Expense Reimbursement Amount_ ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by Buyer
to Sellers in writing.

 

(c) In no event shall the aggregate amount of the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement Amount exceed $8,000,000.

 

(d) The obligations of Sellers to pay the Break-Up Fee and the Expense
Reimbursement Amount as provided herein shall be entitled to administrative
expense status with priority over any and all administrative expenses of the
kind specified in Sections 503(b)(1) and 507(a) of the Bankruptcy Code in the
Bankruptcy Case and senior to all other superpriority administrative
expenses in the Bankruptcy Case.

(e) Sellers agree and acknowledge that Buyers due diligence, efforts,
negotiation and execution of this Agreement have involved substantial
investment of management time and have required significant commitment of
financial, legal and other resources by Buyer and its Affiliates and that such
due diligence, efforts, negotiation and execution have provided value to
Sellers.

Section 7.7 _Financing_.

 

(a) Buyer covenants and agrees with Sellers that it will ( _i_ ) use
reasonable best efforts to obtain a Debt Financing Commitment as promptly as
practicable, to arrange and consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing and to keep the Sellers reasonably apprised on a current basis of the
status of its efforts with respect to obtaining a Debt Financing Commitment
and arranging and consummating the Debt Financing and ( _ii_ ) cause the
Equity Commitment Party to fund the Equity Financing at the Closing subject to
the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment Letter. Buyer shall not,
without the prior written consent of the Sellers, amend, supplement, modify
or waive any provision under the Equity Commitment Letter or, once obtained,
the Debt Financing Commitment in a manner that would reasonably be expected 

 



34  to materially and adversely impact the ability of Buyer to ( _a_ ) enforce
its rights against other parties to the Equity Commitment Letter, ( _b_ )
enforce its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment or, if applicable,
under a replacement Debt Financing Commitment or ( _c_ ) otherwise timely
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(b) In order to assist the Buyer with obtaining the Debt Financing and any
other debt financing for the Business following the Closing, the Sellers
shall, and shall cause their Subsidiaries to, provide such assistance and
cooperation as the Buyer may reasonably request, including cooperation in the
preparation of documentation for the Debt Financing or a credit facility of
the Buyer and/or its Subsidiaries that would be effective after the Closing,
the preparation of any information memorandum or similar document, making
senior management of the Sellers reasonably available for customary
presentations and cooperation with prospective lenders in performing their
due diligence, entering into customary agreements and entering into pledge and
security documents, other definitive financing documents or other requested
certificates or documents. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.7(b)_
to the contrary, ( _i_ ) no Seller or Retained Subsidiary shall be required to
pay any commitment fee or similar fee or incur any liability with respect to
obtaining the financing described in this  _Section 7.7(b)_ prior to the
Closing, ( _ii_ ) no officer, director or employee of any Seller shall be
required to execute any documents that will be effective prior to the Closing,
( _iii_ ) no Seller shall be required to issue any information memoranda or
to indemnify any Person in connection with any such financing, and (iv) no
Seller or Retained Subsidiary shall be required to take actions that are
inconsistent with the Sellers fiduciary duties to maximize the value of
their estates.

Section 7.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

(a) On or prior to the date that is seven (7) days following the date hereof,
Sellers shall provide to Buyer their good faith estimate of the Cure Costs
associated with each Real Property Lease and each Contract identified on
_Schedule 1.1(a)_ and _Schedule 2.2(d)_ (assuming for this purpose that the
Closing Date is March 31, 2015).

 

(b) From the Effective Date through ten (10) days prior to the Sale Hearing,
Sellers shall use their reasonable best efforts to promptly (and in no event
later than ten (10) days prior to the Sale Hearing, except with respect to
Contracts entered into after such date) supplement or update _Schedule 2.2(d)_
by providing Buyer written notice of any Contract to which any Seller or
Retained Subsidiary is a party which ( _x_ ) was not set forth on _Schedule
1.1(a)_ or _Schedule 2.2(d)_ as of the Effective Date and ( _y_ ) primarily
relates to the Business or any Acquired Store or is otherwise material to the
operation of the Business following the Closing in substantially the same
manner as conducted as of the date hereof. From the Effective Date through ten
(10) days prior to the Sale Hearing, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, amend
_Schedule 2.2(d)_ and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ by moving any Contract from _Schedule
2.2(d)_ to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ or vice versa by providing Sellers with written
notice thereof, _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall have no right to
add to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ any Contract rejected, in accordance with Section 365
of the Bankruptcy Code, by Sellers prior to Sellers receiving written notice
from Buyer to include such Contract on _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , _provided_ ,
_further_ , that ( _i_ ) until the Sale Hearing, Buyer may, in its sole
discretion, amend _Schedule 2.2(d)_ and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ by moving from
_Schedule 1.1(a)_ to _Schedule 2.2(d)_ any Contract which is the subject of
any dispute relating to Cure Costs, ( _ii_ ) until two Business Days prior to
the Auction, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, amend _Schedule 2.2(d)_

 



35  and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ by moving from _Schedule 1.1(a)_ to _Schedule 2.2(d)_
any Real Property Lease relating to any Excluded Acquired Store, and ( _iii_ )
following the Auction and prior to the Closing, Buyer may, in its sole
discretion, amend _Schedule 2.2(d)_ and _Schedule 1.1(a)_ by moving any
Contract from _Schedule 2.2(d)_ to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , but not vice versa.

 

(c) To the extent that any franchise agreements or similar Contracts are added
to _Schedule 1.1(a)_ , Buyers and Sellers shall negotiate reasonably and in
good faith amendments to this Agreement to provide for the successful
assignment to, and assumption and future performance by, Buyer of such
Contracts (it being understood that the purpose of such amendments would be to
minimize liabilities under, and potential litigation and other risk to the
Business arising from, such Contracts).

(d) From the Effective Date through two Business Days prior to the Closing,
Buyer may, in its sole discretion, amend _Schedule 2.1(k)_ by removing all or
any portion of any asset, property or right listed thereon by providing
Sellers with written notice thereof;  _provided_ , that no such removal will
result in a reduction in the amount of the Cash Consideration or the Credit
Bid Consideration.

 

Section 7.9 _Employees_. Within fifteen (15) days after the Effective Date,
Sellers shall provide Buyer a complete and accurate list of the names of
Sellers employees, and their corresponding job titles, store or office
locations (as the case may be), dates of hire, current rates of compensation,
accrued and unused vacation leave and sick leave and other commitments that
exist with respect to such employees, whether oral or in writing. Such list
shall also indicate which such employees, if any, are not actively at work as
of the date specified therein (other than due to vacation or short-term
illness). Buyer may offer employment effective as of the Closing Date to such
employees as Buyer shall determine in its sole discretion, at such salary
and/or wage levels, with such benefits and under such other terms and
conditions as Buyer shall determine in its sole discretion. Any employee who
accepts an offer of employment from Buyer on or within 30 days after the
Closing date shall be referred to herein as a " _Transferred Employee_ ".
Sellers shall retain all liabilities (including accrued vacation and
liabilities arising in connection with COBRA) in respect of all of its
employees, including Transferred Employees, other than liabilities associated
with the Transferred Employees service with Buyer after the Closing Date.
Sellers shall remain solely responsible for any and all obligations that
might arise under the WARN Act arising out of any employment losses occurring
prior to, on or after the Closing Date with respect to all current and former
employees as of the Closing Date, and shall take all actions that are
necessary to comply with the WARN Act, including providing any notices
required under the WARN Act. Sellers shall remain liable for all workers
compensation claims arising out of injuries or occupational diseases
sustained or contracted before the date the Transferred Employee commences
employment with the Buyer.

 

Section 7.10 _Damage or Destruction_. Until the Closing, the Acquired Assets
shall remain at the risk of the Sellers. In the event of ( _i_ ) any material
damage to or destruction of any of the Acquired Assets after the date hereof
and prior to the Closing (in any such case, a " _Damage or Destruction Loss_
") or ( _ii_ ) any sale or other transfer out of an Acquired Store (other
than to another Acquired Store) of any Equipment located in an Acquired Store
as of the date hereof (an " _Equipment Loss_ ") the Seller shall give notice
thereof to the Buyer promptly thereafter. If any such Damage or Destruction
Loss is covered by policies of insurance and the

 



36  underlying Acquired Asset is not repaired or replaced prior to Closing, all
right and claim of the Sellers to any proceeds of insurance for such Damage or
Destruction Loss shall be assigned and (if previously received by the Sellers
and not used prior to the Closing Date to repair any damage or destruction)
paid to the Buyer at Closing in accordance with _Section 2.1(i)_. If any such
Damage or Destruction Loss is not covered by policies of insurance, the Buyer
shall have the right to reduce the Credit Bid Consideration by an amount equal
to ( _i_ ) if such Affected Assets are not destroyed or damaged beyond repair
and are able to be repaired to substantially the same condition that existed
prior to such Damage or Destruction Loss at a cost less than their replacement
cost, the estimated cost to repair or restore the Acquired Assets affected by
such Damage or Destruction Loss (the " _Affected Assets_ ") to substantially
the same condition that existed immediately prior to the occurrence of such
Damage or Destruction Loss, or ( _ii_ ) if such Affected Assets are destroyed
or damaged beyond repair or are not able to be repaired to substantially the
same condition that existed prior to such Damage or Destruction Loss at a cost
less than their replacement cost, the replacement cost of the Affected Assets.
In the event of an Equipment Loss, the Buyer shall have the right to reduce
the Credit Bid Consideration by an amount equal to the replacement cost of the
applicable underlying Equipment. If the Buyer elects to reduce the Credit Bid
Consideration pursuant to this _Section 7.10_, the Sellers and the Buyer
shall negotiate in good faith in an effort to agree upon the amount of such
reduction. If the Parties are unable to reach agreement within five (5)
Business Days after notice of the Damage or Destruction Loss or Equipment Loss
is given by the Sellers, then the amount of the reduction shall be determined
by an independent, qualified insurance adjuster selected by the Parties (or,
if they are unable to agree on such selection, one appointed by the Bankruptcy
Court upon application of either the Buyer or the Sellers).

Section 7.11 _Transition Services Agreement; Identified Party Agreements_.

 

(a) The Parties shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to agree on
a form of Transition Services Agreement as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Date.

(b) Buyer shall keep Sellers reasonably apprised on a current basis of the
status of any discussions or negotiations between Buyer and the Identified
Party (or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives) with respect
to the transactions and other matters contemplated by the Term Sheets, and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to complete any discussions or
negotiations by no later than fifteen (15) days following the Filing. Buyer
shall provide to Sellers copies of the execution version of each definitive
agreement entered into or to be entered into between Buyer and the Identified
Party (or any of their respective Affiliates) in connection with the
transactions or other matters contemplated by the Term Sheets. To the extent
that any of the documents referred to in the immediately preceding
sentence are subsequently revised, Buyer shall provide copies thereof to
Seller as promptly as reasonably practicable. Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that Sellers may use the Term Sheets and the information and documentation
provided to them by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.11_ to facilitate the
Auction in accordance with the Bidding Procedures.

Section 7.12 _Letters of Credit_. The Buyer shall be entitled to credit bid
L/C Reimbursement Obligations pursuant to _Section 3.1(b)_. To the extent
that a portion of the purchase price is paid by a credit against L/C
Reimbursement Obligations relating to any Letter of Credit pursuant to
_Section 3.1(b)_ and the full amount of such Letter of Credit shall not have

 



37  been drawn at or prior to the expiration of such Letter of Credit, then
promptly following such expiration, Buyer shall reimburse Sellers, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds, an amount equal to the difference
between ( _i_ ) such credit against the purchase price and (ii) the portion of
the Letter of Credit actually drawn ( _x_ ) at or after the Closing and ( _y_
) at or prior to such expiration.

Taxes_ ") shall be borne by Sellers and, to the extent Buyer is required by
applicable Law to pay Transfer Taxes, such Transfer Taxes shall be paid by
the appropriate Seller to Buyer at Closing. Sellers and Buyer shall use
reasonable efforts and cooperate in good faith to exempt the sale and transfer
of the Acquired Assets from any such Transfer Taxes. Sellers shall prepare
and file all necessary Tax Returns or other documents with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event any such Tax Return

Sellers, which shall cause it to be filed. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer for
any Tax described in this _Section 8.1(a)_ that is paid by Buyer to a
Governmental Authority.

Buyers and Sellers Representatives available to testify before the
Bankruptcy Court.

(b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, Buyer shall,
from and after the Closing Date, ( _i_ ) assume all Liabilities of Sellers

party making such representations and warranties has no knowledge or only
incomplete knowledge, and such representations and warranties may be qualified
by disclosures contained in the Schedules. Consequently, Persons other than

so far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such

and the application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall
not be affected by such invalidity or unenforceability.

this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related

by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware

Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by

this Agreement shall confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations,
liabilities or claims hereunder upon any Person not a Party or a permitted
assignee of a Party.

Section 12.10  _Non-Recourse_. All claims, obligations, liabilities or causes
of action (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity or granted by
statute) that may be based upon, in respect of, arise under, out or by reason
of, be connected with or relate in any manner to this Agreement, the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in connection with or as an inducement to this
Agreement) or the transactions contemplated hereby may be made only against
(and are those solely of) the entities that are expressly identified as
Parties to this Agreement. No other Person, including any of their Affiliates,
directors, officers, employees, incorporators, members, partners,
managers, stockholders, agents, attorneys, or representatives of, or any
financial advisors or lenders to, any of the foregoing shall have any
liabilities (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted
by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities,
other than fraud claims, arising under, out of, in connection with, or related
in any manner to, this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of,
this Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance or breach.

Section 12.11 _Schedules; Materiality_. The inclusion of any matter in any
Schedule shall be deemed to be an inclusion for all purposes of this
Agreement, to the extent that such disclosure is sufficient to identify the
Section to which such disclosure is responsive, but inclusion therein shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission, or otherwise imply, that any such
matter is material or creates a measure for materiality for purposes of this
Agreement. The disclosure of any particular fact or item in any Schedule shall
not be deemed an admission as to whether the fact or item is "material" or
would constitute a "Material Adverse Effect."

Section 12.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and agree that
( _a_ ) irreparable injury, for which monetary damages, even if available,
would not be an adequate remedy, will occur in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with the
specific terms hereof or are otherwise breached, and ( _b_ ) the non-breaching
Party or Parties shall therefore be entitled, in addition to any other
remedies that may be available, to obtain (without the posting of any bond)
specific performance of the terms of this Agreement. If any Proceeding is
brought by the non-breaching Party or Parties to enforce this Agreement, the
Party in breach shall waive the defense that there is an adequate remedy at
law.

 



49 Section 12.13 _Survival_. All covenants and agreements contained herein which
by their terms are to be performed in whole or in part, or which prohibit
actions, subsequent to the Closing shall survive the Closing and terminate on
the earlier of their completion and the one year anniversary the Closing Date.
All other covenants and agreements contained herein, and all representations
and warranties contained herein or in any certificated deliveries hereunder,
shall not survive the Closing and shall thereupon terminate.
