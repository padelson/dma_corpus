ARTICLE I 
  
  The Offer

  


 

  

SECTION 1.01. _The Offer._ (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable (but in no event later than seven
business days after the date of this Agreement), Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence the Offer within the meaning of the
applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the " _SEC_ "). The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Exhibit A (the " _Offer Conditions_
"). The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be 12:00 midnight, New York
City time, on the 20th business day (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ")) following the
commencement (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act) of the
Offer. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to waive any Offer Condition or
modify the terms of the Offer in any manner not inconsistent with this
Agreement, except that, without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall
not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub to, (i) reduce the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer
Price, (iii) change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iv)
waive, amend or modify the Minimum Tender Condition or the Termination
Condition, (v) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer other than the
Offer Conditions or amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition in any
manner adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock, (vi) except as
otherwise provided in this Section 1.01(a), terminate, or extend or otherwise
amend or modify the expiration date of, the Offer, (vii) otherwise amend,
modify or supplement any of the terms of the Offer in any manner adverse to
the holders of Company Common Stock or (viii) provide any "subsequent offering
period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 of the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (A)
extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than five
business days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the
Company), if at the scheduled expiration date of the Offer any of the Offer
Conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall not have been
satisfied or waived, until such time as such conditions shall have been
satisfied or waived and (B) extend the Offer for the minimum period required
by any rule, regulation or interpretation or position of the SEC or the staff
thereof applicable to the Offer; provided that Merger Sub shall not be
required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside Date. In addition, if at the
otherwise scheduled expiration date of the Offer each Offer Condition (other
than the Minimum Tender Condition) shall have been satisfied or waived and the
Minimum Tender Condition shall not have been satisfied, Merger Sub shall have
the right to (and, if

  

 

2  

  


 

  

requested by the Company, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub
to) extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments of not more than
five business days each (or for such longer period as may be agreed by the
Company); _provided_ that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer
beyond the Outside Date. On the terms and subject only to the conditions of
the Offer and this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, all shares of Company Common Stock
validly tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the Offer that Merger Sub
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer as soon as practicable
after the expiration of the Offer and, in any event, no more than three
business days after the Acceptance Time. The time at which Merger Sub first
accepts for payment the shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer
is referred to as the " _Acceptance Time_ ". The Offer may not be terminated
prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-
extended in accordance with this Section 1.01(a)), unless this Agreement is
validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.01. If this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with Section 8.01 prior to the Acceptance Time,
Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, immediately,
irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and Merger Sub shall
neither acquire nor pay for shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, promptly return, and Parent and Merger Sub shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, all tendered shares of
Company Common Stock to the registered holders thereof. Nothing contained in
this Section 1.01(a) shall affect any termination rights set forth in Section
8.01.

  


 

  

(b) As promptly as practicable on the date of commencement (within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 of the Exchange Act) of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall
file with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain or incorporate by reference an offer to purchase
and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement (such Schedule
TO and the documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be
made, together with any exhibits, supplements or amendments thereto, the "
_Offer Documents_ ") and shall disseminate the appropriate Offer Documents to
the holders of Company Common Stock. The Company shall furnish to Parent and
Merger Sub all information concerning the Company required by the Exchange Act
to be set forth in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub
shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and
to cause the Offer Documents, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case
as and to the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. Parent
and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of any
written comments, and shall inform the Company and its counsel of any oral
comments, that Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel may receive from the SEC or
its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of
such comments. Except with respect to any amendments after an Adverse
Recommendation Change, prior to the filing of the Offer Documents (including
any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the dissemination thereof
to the

  

 

3  

  


 

  

holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect to the Offer Documents, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Offer Documents or response (including the proposed final version thereof),
and Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by the Company or its counsel.

  


 

  

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common Stock that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the Offer.

  

  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares
of Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent or Merger Sub is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision
of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  

  

SECTION 1.02. _Company Actions._ (a) Subject to Sections 5.03, the Company
hereby approves of, declares advisable and consents to the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "
_Transactions_ ").

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 5.03(e), on the date the Offer Documents are filed with
the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D‑9 with respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D‑9, as
amended from time to time, the " _Schedule 14D‑9_"), including a description
of the Company Board Recommendation, and shall disseminate the Schedule 14D‑9
to the holders of Company Common Stock. The Schedule 14D-9 shall also contain
the notice of appraisal rights required to be delivered by the Company under
Section 262(d) of the DGCL at the time the Company first files the Schedule
14D-9 with the SEC. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to
be set forth in the Schedule 14D‑9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D‑9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all steps
necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D‑9 and to cause the Schedule
14D‑9, as so amended or supplemented, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the holders of Company Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable Federal securities Laws. The Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall
inform Parent and its counsel of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule
14D‑9 promptly after the receipt of such comments. Except with respect to any
amendments filed after an Adverse Recommendation Change or in connection with
any disclosures made in compliance with Section 5.03, prior to the filing of
the Schedule

  

 

4  

  


 

  

14D‑9 (including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or the
dissemination thereof to the holders of Company Common Stock, or responding to
any comments of the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D‑9, the Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such Schedule 14D‑9 or response (including the proposed final version
thereof), and the Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration
to any comments made by Parent or its counsel. The Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the Company Board
Recommendation (except to the extent that the Company Board shall have
withdrawn or modified the Company Board Recommendation in accordance with
Section 5.03(e)).

  


 

  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to promptly furnish Merger Sub with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of Company Common Stock as of a recent date
and of those Persons becoming record holders subsequent to such date, together
with copies of all lists of stockholders, security position listings, computer
files and all other information in the Company's possession or control
regarding the beneficial owners of Company Common Stock, and shall furnish to
Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists of
stockholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent may
reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Company's stockholders.
Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for such steps as
are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other documents
necessary to consummate the Transactions, Parent and Merger Sub shall hold in
confidence the information contained in any such labels, lists, listings,
files and other information, shall use such information only in connection
with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated,
shall, upon request, deliver to the Company all copies of such information.

extent

  

 

5  

  


 

  

permitted by Law) waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits

be agreed in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Merger
Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Merger Closing Date_
".

  


 

  

SECTION 2.03. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Merger Closing, Parent and the
Company shall prepare, and on the Merger Closing Date, the Company shall file
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger
(the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required

such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of
State or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify

referred to herein as the " _Effective Time_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 2.04. _Effects of Merger._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth
in Section 259 of the DGCL.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws._ (a) At the Effective
Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated as set forth in Exhibit B and, as so amended and
restated, such certificate of incorporation shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) The By-laws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the By-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
changed or amended as provided therein or permitted by applicable Law, except
that references to the name of Merger Sub shall be replaced by the name of the
Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.06. _Directors and Officers._ (a) The directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the
Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or
until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case
may be.

  


 

  

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their
resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.07. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:

  


 

  

(a) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

 

6  

  


 

  


 

  

(b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Company Common
Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries._ Each share of Company Common Stock that
is owned by the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any other subsidiary of Parent
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor. Each share of Company Common Stock held by
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall
be converted into such number of shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation such that each such Company Subsidiary owns the same percentage of
the outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation immediately
following the Effective Time as such Company Subsidiary owned in the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(c) _Conversion of Other Company Common Stock._ Subject to Sections 2.07(b)
and 2.07(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall
be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price in cash, without
interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of any such shares of Company Common Stock shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration in accordance with Section 2.08, without interest.

  


 

  

(d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any Person who is entitled to
demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who
complies in all respects with, Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_")
(such shares, " _Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.07(c), but instead shall be canceled
and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled only to receive such
consideration as is determined to be due with respect to such Appraisal Shares
pursuant to Section 262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder
shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to
appraisal under Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid such
consideration as is determined to be due pursuant to Section 262 shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and shall represent only the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.07(c), without interest thereon. The
Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands received by the
Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall
have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and Proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

  


 

  

SECTION 2.08. _Payment of Merger Consideration._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to
the Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for
the payment of the Merger Consideration to former holders of Company Common
Stock and, in connection therewith, prior to the Effective Time, shall enter
into an agreement with the

  

 

7  

  


 

  

Paying Agent in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent shall take
all steps necessary to enable and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide to the Paying Agent, at or immediately after the Effective Time, cash
necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the
right to receive cash pursuant to Section 2.07(c) (such cash being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

  


 

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_ ") which were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.07 (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall be in such form and have
such other provisions as are customary and reasonably acceptable to the
Company and Parent) and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate to the Paying Agent for cancelation, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of
Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to Section 2.07, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
2.08, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of cash,
without interest, into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
represented by such Certificate have been converted pursuant to Section 2.07.
No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any
Certificate.

  


 

  

(c) _Treatment of Book-Entry Shares._ As soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time (but in no event later than two business days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail a check, or make a wire transfer, to each holder, as of the
Effective Time of the Merger, of Book-Entry Shares in an amount of U.S.
dollars equal to the aggregate amount of Merger Consideration to which such
holder is entitled hereunder.

  


 

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger
Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II as a result
of the conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common

  

 

8  

  


 

  

Stock. After the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented
to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

  


 

  

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed as of the 12-month anniversary of the Merger Closing
Date shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any former holder of
Company Common Stock entitled to payment of Merger Consideration who has not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.

  


 

  

(f) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate has
not been surrendered prior to the date on which the Merger Consideration in
respect of such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property
of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration in respect of such
Certificate shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately
prior to such date become the property of the Surviving Corporation, subject
to the claims of any former holder of Company Common Stock entitled to payment
of Merger Consideration who has not theretofore complied with this Article II.

  


 

  

(g) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to
Parent. In no event, however, shall such investment or any such payment of
interest or income delay the receipt by former holders of Company Common Stock
of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders' rights
hereunder. To the extent that there are any losses with respect to any
investments of the Exchange Fund, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for any
reason below the level required for the Paying Agent to promptly pay the
Merger Consideration to all holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares,
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, promptly replace or
restore the cash in the Exchange Fund so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund
is at all times maintained at a level sufficient for the Paying Agent to make
such payments.

  


 

  

(h) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable and customary amount
as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against
it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration, without interest.

  

 

9  

  


 

  


 

  

(i) _Withholding Rights._ Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under any
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Amounts so withheld and paid
over to the appropriate taxing authority shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the former holder of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

  


 

  

ARTICLE III 
  
  Representations and Warranties of the Company

  


 

  

Except as disclosed in the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other
documents filed by the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the SEC
and publicly available subsequent to January 1, 2016 and prior to the date of
this Agreement (the " _Filed Company SEC Documents_ ") (excluding any exhibits
to any Filed Company SEC Documents or any disclosures contained in any part of
any Filed Company SEC Document entitled "Risk Factors" or disclosures of risks
set forth in any "Forward-Looking Statements" disclaimer, in each case that

the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent and Merger Sub (which
shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections corresponding to the
numbered and lettered sections contained in this Article III, and the

sections in this Article III to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on
its face that such disclosure also qualifies or applies to such other
sections) (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ "), the Company represents and
warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  


 

  

SECTION 3.01. _Organization, Standing and Power._ Each of the Company and each
of its subsidiaries (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized (in the case of good standing, to the extent the concept
is recognized by such jurisdiction), except in the case of Company
Subsidiaries where any such failure would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each

Merger Sub has not carried on any business, conducted any operations or
incurred any liabilities or obligations other than the execution of this
Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary
thereto.

  


 

  

(b) The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, all of which have been validly
issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by Parent or a wholly
owned Subsidiary of Parent free and clear of any Lien.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.03. _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability._ Each of
Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the Transactions,

following the execution of this Agreement). The

execution and delivery by each of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement and
the consummation by it of the Transactions have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action on the part of Parent and Merger Sub, subject, in
the case of the Merger, to the adoption of this Agreement by Parent, as sole
stockholder of Merger Sub (which shall occur promptly following the execution
of this Agreement). Neither the approval nor adoption of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or the other Transactions requires
any approval of the stockholders of Parent. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has
duly executed and delivered this Agreement, and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by the Company, this Agreement constitutes its legal,
valid and binding obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms (except insofar as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other Laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights, or by principles governing the
availability of equitable remedies, whether considered in a Proceeding at law
or in equity).

  


 

  

SECTION 4.04. _No Conflicts; Consents._ (a) The execution and delivery by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of this Agreement do not, and the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions and compliance with the terms
hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or default
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a
right of termination, cancelation or acceleration of any obligation or loss of
a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien upon any of
the properties or assets of Parent or Merger Sub under, any provision of (i)
the organizational documents of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) any Contract to
which Parent or Merger Sub is a party or by which any of their respective
properties or assets is bound or (iii) subject to the filings and other
matters referred to in Section 4.04(b), any Judgment or Law applicable to
Parent or any of its subsidiaries or their respective properties or assets,
other than, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

(b) No Consent of, or registration, declaration or filing with, or permit
from, any Governmental Entity is required to be obtained or made by or with
respect to Parent or any of its subsidiaries in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance of this Agreement or the consummation of the
Transactions, other than (i) compliance with and filings under the HSR Act and
any Foreign Merger Control Law, (ii) the filing with the SEC of (A) the Offer
Documents and (B) such reports under the Exchange Act as may be required in
connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, (iii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and (iv) such other items (A) required
solely by reason of the participation of the Company (as opposed to any third
Person) in the Transactions or (B) that the failure of which to obtain or make
would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.05. _Information Supplied._ None of the information supplied or to
be supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub for inclusion in the Offer
Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 will, at the time such document is filed with
the SEC, at any time it is amended or supplemented or at the time it is first
published, sent or given

  

 

31  

  


 

  

to the Company's stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading. The
Offer Documents will, at the time such documents are filed with the SEC,
comply as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Exchange Act, except that no representation or warranty is made by Parent or
Merger Sub with respect to statements included or incorporated by reference
therein based on information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for
inclusion or incorporation by reference therein.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.06. _Brokers._ No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person, other than Dyal Co. LLC, the fees and expenses of which will be
paid by Parent, is entitled to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or
other similar fee or commission in connection with the Offer, the Merger and
the other Transactions based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent
or any of its affiliates.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.07. _Litigation._ There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or any subsidiary of Parent
that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect, nor is there any Judgment outstanding against
Parent or any subsidiary of Parent that would reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.08. _Ownership of Company Common Stock._ None of Parent, Merger Sub
or any of their respective "affiliates" or "associates" is, or has been at any
time during the last three years, an "interested stockholder" of the Company
(in each case as such terms are defined in Section 203 of the DGCL). Neither
Parent nor Merger Sub nor any of their "affiliates" or "associates" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) owns (within the meaning of Section 203 of
the DGCL) any Company Common Stock or holds any rights to acquire any Company
Common Stock except pursuant to this Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 4.09. _Available Funds._ Parent and Merger Sub have or will have
available funds sufficient to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and, at the
expiration of the Offer and the Effective Time, Parent and Merger Sub will
have available all of the funds necessary for the acquisition of all shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and the Merger, as the case may be,
to pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, to make payments
pursuant to Section 6.04 and to perform their respective obligations under
this Agreement.

SECTION 5.02. _No Frustration of Conditions._ The Company and Parent shall
not, and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to, take any

would, or would reasonably be expected to, result in any Offer Condition or
any condition to the Merger set forth in Article VII not being satisfied.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.03. _No Solicitation._ (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it
authorize or permit any Company Subsidiary or any of its or their respective
officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys or other
advisors or representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (A)
directly or indirectly solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or encourage
the submission of any Company Takeover Proposal or any inquiry relating
thereto or (B) directly or indirectly participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to or in connection with, or take any other action intended to facilitate or
encourage the making of any proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal. To the extent consistent
with its fiduciary duties, the Company Board shall not authorize or permit the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any of their respective Representatives,
to fail to enforce, or grant any waiver or release under, any standstill or
similar agreement with respect to any capital stock of the Company or any of
the Company Subsidiaries (and to the extent any such waiver or release is
granted or such standstill or similar agreement is not enforced, the

It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the Company set forth
in this Section 5.03 by any Representative of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries acting with the authority of the Company or any Company

negotiations regarding any proposal pending on the date of this Agreement that

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.03(a) or
Section 5.03(b) or any other provision of this Agreement, at any time prior to
the

  

 

36  

  


 

  

Acceptance Time, (x) the Company may contact the Person making any Company
Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.03
solely to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (y) in response to a
Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section
5.03 and if the Company Board determines, in good faith, after consultation
with outside counsel and a financial advisor, that such Company Takeover
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Company Proposal (a " _Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal_ ") and that the
failure to take such actions described in clauses (A) and (B) below would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Company's stockholders under
applicable Law, the Company may (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company to the Person making such Qualifying Company Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement so long as
the Company also provides Parent, prior to or substantially concurrently with
the time such information is provided or made available to such Person, in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any non-public
information furnished to such other Person which was not previously furnished
to Parent, except to the extent providing Parent with such information would
violate applicable Law, and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
with such Person and its Representatives regarding such Qualifying Company
Takeover Proposal.

  


 

  

(d) The Company shall as promptly as practicable (and in any event within 24
hours after receipt thereof) notify Parent of any Company Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry with respect to or that could reasonably be expected to lead to
any Company Takeover Proposal, which notice shall include the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and the material
terms thereof. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed of the status
of any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including promptly informing
Parent of any change to the material terms or conditions thereof).

  


 

  

(e) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A) withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, or propose publicly to
withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub, the Company
Board Recommendation or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to
approve or recommend, any Company Takeover Proposal or resolve or agree to
take any such action (any action described in this clause (i) being referred
to herein as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or
recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or permit the Company
or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other agreement relating to any Company Takeover Proposal (other than an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with this
Section 5.03), or resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such action.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing or any other
provision of this Agreement, but subject to Section 5.03(f), if the Company
Board determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law, then (A) the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Superior Company Proposal or an

  

 

37  

  


 

  

Intervening Event, and (B) if the Company Board receives a Superior Company
Proposal, the Company may terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g)
in accordance with Section 8.04(b).

  


 

  

(f) The Company Board shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g) unless (A) the Company
shall have provided Parent with written notice at least three business days
before taking that action setting forth the Company's intention to take such
action and containing (x) if such action is intended to be taken in response
to a Superior Company Proposal, a copy of the most current version of the
proposed agreement under which the transaction contemplated by such Superior
Company Proposal is proposed to be consummated and the identity of the Person
making the Superior Company Proposal or (y) if such action is intended to be
taken in circumstances involving an Intervening Event, a reasonably detailed
description of the underlying facts giving rise to, and the reasons for
taking, such action, and (B) Parent does not make, within the foregoing three
business day period, a binding proposal to amend or modify this Agreement that
(x) in the case of any action intended to be taken in response to a Superior
Company Proposal, is in the good faith judgment of the Company Board at least
as favorable to the stockholders of the Company as such Superior Company
Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the financial
terms or other material terms of such Superior Company Proposal shall require
a new written notification from the Company and a new two business day period
under this Section 5.03(f)), or (y) in the case of any action intended to be
taken in circumstances involving an Intervening Event, obviates the need for
taking such action. During any such three or two business day period referred
to in the preceding sentence, the Company shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, negotiate in good faith with Parent (to the extent
requested by Parent) with respect to any revisions proposed by Parent to the
terms of this Agreement and the Transactions.

  


 

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Section 5.03 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders
a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e‑2(a) under the Exchange Act
or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Company Board
determines, in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or
applicable Law; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change will be
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (it being understood
that (i) any "stop, look and listen" letter or similar communication of the
type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act and (ii) any
disclosure of information to the Company's stockholders that describes the
Company's receipt of a Company Takeover Proposal and the operation of this
Agreement with respect thereto and contains a statement that the Company Board
has not effected an Adverse Recommendation Change shall be deemed to not be an
Adverse Recommendation Change).

  


 

  

(h) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

" _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a customary confidentiality
agreement that contains confidentiality provisions that are no less

  

 

38  

  


 

  

favorable in the aggregate to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ that such confidentiality agreement may
omit or contain a "standstill" or similar obligation to the extent that Parent
is, concurrently with the entry by the Company or any Company Subsidiary into
such confidentiality agreement, released from any "standstill" or other
similar obligation in the Confidentiality Agreement.

  


 

  

" _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any

Company Board) of the assets (including capital stock of the Company
Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or
(B) 20% or more of the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the
Company or (ii) any tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation,

Person) owning, directly or indirectly, 20% or more of the aggregate voting
power of the capital stock of the Company or of the surviving entity or the
resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity,
other than, in each case, the Transactions.

  


 

  

" _Intervening Event_ " shall mean an event, occurrence, fact or change that
materially affects the business, assets or operations of the Company occurring
or arising after the date hereof that was not known or reasonably foreseeable
to the Board as of the date hereof (or if known or reasonably foreseeable, the
consequences of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable), which event,
occurrence, fact or change, or consequence thereof, becomes known to the Board
prior to the Acceptance Time, other than (i) changes in the Company Common
Stock price, in and of itself (however, the underlying reasons for such
changes may constitute an Intervening Event), (ii) any Company Takeover
Proposal or (iii) the fact that, in and of itself, the Company exceeds any
internal or published projections, estimates or expectations of the Company's
revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of operations for
any period, in and of itself (however, the underlying reasons for such events
may constitute an Intervening Event).

  


 

  

" _Superior Company Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Company Takeover
Proposal that if consummated would result in a Person or group (or the
shareholders of any Person) owning, directly or indirectly, (i) 50% or more of
the aggregate voting power of the capital stock of the Company or of the
surviving entity or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or
such surviving entity or (ii) 50% or more (based on the fair market value
thereof, as determined by the Company Board) of the assets (including capital
stock of the Company Subsidiaries) of the Company and Company Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (A) on terms which the Company Board determines, in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor, would
result in greater value to the stockholders of the Company from a financial
point of view than the Transactions, taking into account all the terms and
conditions of such proposal and this Agreement and (B) that is reasonably
capable of being completed

  

 

39  

  


 

  

relative to the Transactions, taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal.

  


 

  

Wherever the term "group" is used in this Section 5.03(h), it is used as
defined in Rule 13d-5 under the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

SECTION 5.04. _Communications and Interactions with Regulatory Authorities._

Entity related to any Product Candidate and (ii) promptly inform Parent in
writing of reports from any source of any serious adverse event, as that term
is defined at 21 C.F.R. 312.32, for any Product Candidate; provided that the
failure to deliver any such notification, in and of itself, shall not result
in the failure of, or otherwise affect, any of the Offer Conditions.

operation of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries) during
the period prior to the Effective Time to all their respective properties,
books and records and Contracts and, during such period, the Company shall,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, furnish, as promptly as reasonably
practicable, to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and
personnel as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ , that any
such access shall be afforded and any such information shall be furnished at
Parent's expense. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, neither
the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to afford
access or furnish information to the extent (a) such information is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party, (b) relating to
the minutes of the meetings of the Company Board (including any presentations
or other materials prepared by or for the Company Board) where the Company
Board discussed the Transactions or any similar transaction between the
Company and any other Person or (c) the Company determines in good faith that
affording such access or furnishing such information would jeopardize the

  

 

40  

  


 

  

attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries,
violate applicable Law or result in significant antitrust risk for the Company
or any of the Company Subsidiaries; _provided_ , in the case of clauses (a)
and (c), that the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
make alternative arrangements to afford such access or furnish such
information without breaching such confidentiality agreement, jeopardizing
such attorney-client privilege, violating applicable Law or resulting in such
antitrust risk, as applicable. All information exchanged pursuant to this
Section 6.02 shall be subject to the confidentiality letter agreement dated
March 5, 2018, between the Company and Parent (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

  


 

  

SECTION 6.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts; Notification._ (a) Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
shall, and shall cause their respective subsidiaries to, use its reasonable
best efforts to promptly take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do,
or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in
doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, as promptly as practicable, the Offer, the Merger and the other
Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-
actions, waivers and Consents from, the making of all necessary registrations,
declarations and filings with and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be
necessary to avoid a Proceeding by any Governmental Entity with respect to
this Agreement or the Transactions, (ii) the defending or contesting of any
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or
the consummation of the Transactions, including seeking to have any stay or
temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (iii) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully carry out
the purposes of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject in each case to the final sentence of this Section
6.03(a), Parent acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to use reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions includes (A)
executing settlements, undertakings, consent decrees, stipulations or other
agreements with any Governmental Entity or with any other Person, (B) agreeing
to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any asset or business of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries, (C) permitting
the Company to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate any assets or
businesses of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (D) terminating existing
relationships, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the Company or any
of their respective subsidiaries, (E) terminating any joint venture or other
arrangement of Parent, the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries,
(F) creating any relationship, contractual right or obligation of Parent, the
Company or any of their respective subsidiaries and (G) effectuating any other
change or restructuring of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (and, in the
case of actions by or with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
by consenting to such action by the Company or such Company Subsidiary
(including any consents required under this Agreement with respect to such
action); provided that any such action may, at the discretion of the Company,
be conditioned upon the Closing), in each case such that all actions or non-
actions, waivers and Consents from any Governmental Entity that are necessary
in order to consummate the Offer, the Merger and the other

  

 

41  

  


 

  

Transactions are obtained at least 5 business days prior to the Outside Date.
In addition and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and the Company
Board shall (I) take all action necessary to ensure that no state takeover
statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to any
Transaction or this Agreement and (II) if any state takeover statute or
similar statute or regulation becomes applicable to any Transaction or this
Agreement, take all action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation
on the Transactions and this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall require Parent to: (1) agree to
sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate AVXS-101, (2) permit the
Company to sell, divest or otherwise convey or hold separate AVXS-101, (3)
terminate existing relationships, contractual rights or obligations of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary relating to the development of AVXS-101, (4)

relating to the development of AVXS-101, or (7) enter into any settlement,
undertaking, consent decree, stipulation or agreement with any Governmental
Entity to do any of the foregoing in connection with the completion and
consummation of the Transactions (each action or condition described in
clauses (1)-(7), a " _Burdensome Condition_ ").

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of the parties' obligations under Section
6.03(a), and in furtherance thereof, Parent and the Company shall, in
consultation and cooperation with the other, (i) file as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than seven business days after the date of
this Agreement), with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the " _FTC_

notification and report form, if any, required under the HSR Act for the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions and (ii) file as promptly
as practicable all appropriate filings required under any Foreign Merger

the case may be. Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) furnish to the other
party such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party
may request in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission
which is necessary under the HSR Act or any Foreign Merger Control Law, (ii)
give the other party reasonable prior notice of any such filings or
submissions and, to the extent reasonably practicable, of any communication
with, and any inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC,

submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (iii) unless prohibited by
applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Entity, and to the extent
reasonably practicable, (A) not participate in or attend any meeting, or

with any Governmental Entity in respect of the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions without the other party, (B) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C) in the event
one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental
Entity from participating in or attending any such meeting or engaging in any
such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect thereto, (D)
cooperate with one another in the filing of, and consider the views of one
another in connection with the form and content of, any substantive memoranda,
white papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications
explaining or defending this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the
other Transactions, articulating any regulatory or competitive argument or
responding to requests or objections made by any Governmental Entity and (E)
furnish the other party with copies of all filings, submissions,
correspondence and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between it and its affiliates and their respective Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of any Governmental
Entity's staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger and the other Transactions, (iv) comply with any inquiry or request
from the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity as promptly as

of the other Transactions, including the scheduling of, and strategic planning
for, any meetings with any Governmental Entity relating thereto. Any such
additional information shall be in substantial compliance with the
requirements of the HSR Act or the applicable Foreign Merger Control Law, as
the case may be. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent shall, on behalf of the parties, control and lead all communications
and strategy for dealing with the FTC, the DOJ, and any other Governmental
Entity under the HSR Act or the Foreign Merger Control Laws.

excess, if any, of (1) the Offer Price (or in the case of Company Stock
Options granted under the Company's Amended and Restated 2014 Stock Plan, if
greater, the volume-weighted average trading price of Company Common Stock on
the date of the Acceptance Time (or if such date is not a trading day, the
last trading day)) minus (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (B) the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time; and

  


 

  

(ii) each Company Restricted Stock Unit and each Company Performance Stock
Unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled

  

 

43  

  


 

  

at the Effective Time in exchange for a lump sum cash payment equal to (1) the
Offer Price multiplied by (2) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit or such Company Performance
Stock Unit (as applicable) immediately prior to the Effective Time (in the
case of any Company Performance Stock Unit, treating all applicable
performance measures as satisfied at the maximum level).

  


 

  

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any
committee administering the Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions
and take such other actions as may be required to effectuate the actions
required by this Section 6.04, and shall, to the extent required by applicable
Law outside the U.S., make provision for different treatment than the actions
required by this Section 6.04 for holders of Company Equity Awards residing
outside the U.S. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 6.04 shall be
subject to any required withholding of Taxes and shall be paid without
interest.

  


 

  

(c) As soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event later
than 5 business days following the Effective Time), Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay through its payroll systems all
amounts payable pursuant to Section 6.04(a) to the former holders of Company
Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Stock
Units, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent any such
amounts relate to a Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Stock
Unit that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code, such amounts shall be paid at the earliest time permitted
under the terms of the applicable agreement or Company Stock Plan relating to
such Company Restricted Stock Unit or Company Performance Stock Unit that will
not trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

  


 

  

(i) " _Company Performance Stock Unit_ " means any restricted stock unit award
subject to performance-based vesting, payable in shares of Company Common
Stock or the value of which is determined with reference to the value of
shares of Company Common Stock, whether granted under a Company Stock Plan or
otherwise.

  


 

  

(ii) " _Company Restricted Stock Unit_ " means any restricted stock unit award
subject to service-based vesting, payable in shares of Company Common Stock or

SECTION 6.05. _Employee Matters._ (a) For the remainder of the calendar year
that includes the Effective Time and the following calendar year (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide or cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide to each individual who is employed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Continuing Company Employee_ ") (i) annual base salary or base wage and cash
incentive opportunities that are each no less favorable than those provided to
such Continuing Company Employee by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) other employee benefits
(excluding the value of equity compensation) that are substantially comparable
in the aggregate to those provided to such Continuing Company Employee by the
Company or the Company Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Continuing Company Employees will be eligible to participate in Parent equity
plans following the Effective Time on the same basis as other similarly
situated employees of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
affiliates. Following the Continuation Period, the Continuing Company
Employees shall be entitled to participate in the plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their respective affiliates (the " _Surviving
Corporation Plans_ ") to the same extent as other similarly situated employees
of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective affiliates. In
addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Continuing Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate,
without any waiting time, in any Surviving Corporation Plans providing health
or welfare coverage, to the extent coverage under any such plan replaces
coverage under a comparable benefit plan in which such Continuing Company
Employee participates immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing in this
Section 6.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed to create a
right in any Continuing Company Employee to employment with Parent or the
Surviving Corporation.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.05(a), from and after the
Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
assume, honor and continue in accordance with their terms during the
Continuation Period or, if later, until all obligations thereunder have been
satisfied, all of the Company's employment, severance, retention, termination
and change in control plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements
maintained by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as in
effect at the Effective Time, including with respect to any payments, benefits
or rights arising as a result of the Transactions (either alone or in
combination with any other event), without any amendment or modification
adverse to the applicable employee or participants without their consent,
other than any amendment or modification required to comply with applicable
Law. Parent hereby acknowledges that the consummation of the Transactions
constitutes a "change in control" or a "change of control" (or a term of
similar import) for purposes of any Company Benefit Plan that contains a
definition of "change in control" or "change of control" (or a term of similar
import), as applicable.

  


 

  

(c) With respect to all Surviving Corporation Plans made available to
Continuing Company Employees, including any "employee benefit plan", as
defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by Parent or any of its
respective subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance
plans, but excluding any defined

  

 

45  

  


 

  

benefit pension plans and any post-retirement medical plans), for purposes of
determining eligibility to participate, vesting and amount or level of
benefits, each Continuing Company Employee's service with the Company or any
Company Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the
Company or any such Company Subsidiary, to the extent service with the
predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Company Subsidiary)
shall be treated as service with Parent or any of their respective
subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be
recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service. In addition, Parent shall, and
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, credit each Continuing Company
Employee with paid time off equal to the paid time off such Continuing Company
Employee had accrued with the Company or any Company Subsidiary that was
unused immediately prior to the Effective Time, unless such paid time off is
paid out in accordance with applicable Law.

  


 

  

(d) With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries in which any Continuing Company Employee is eligible to
participate after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting
conditions and exclusions and waiting periods and actively-at-work
requirements with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to such employees and their eligible dependents and beneficiaries,
to the extent such limitations were waived, satisfied or did not apply to such
employees or eligible dependents or beneficiaries under the corresponding
welfare Company Benefit Plan in which such employees participated immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide Continuing Company Employees and
their eligible dependents and beneficiaries with credit for any co-payments
and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time in satisfying any analogous
deductible or out-of-pocket maximum requirements to the extent applicable
under any such plan.

  


 

  

(e) Annual cash incentive bonuses for the fiscal year which includes the
Effective Time shall be treated as set forth in Section 6.05(e) of the Company
Disclosure Letter.

  


 

  

(f) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to
establish a retention program for the benefit and retention of Continuing
Company Employees following the Effective Time.

  


 

  

(g) The provisions of this Section 6.05 are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no Continuing Company Employee or any other
Person (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for
any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this Agreement (except to the
extent provided in Section 9.07 with respect to Sections 6.04 and 6.07), and
no provision of this Section 6.05 shall create such rights in any such Persons
in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under
any Company Benefit Plan or any employee program or any plan or arrangement of
Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Nothing herein shall be construed as an
amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or plan, program, policy, agreement,
arrangement or understanding of Parent.

  

  

  

 

46  

  

  

SECTION 6.06. _Company Warrants_. Following the date of this Agreement, the
Company shall deliver in a timely manner all notices to the holders of
outstanding warrants to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "
_Company Warrants_ ") required under the terms of the Company Warrants in
connection with this Agreement and the Transactions.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.07. _Indemnification._ (a) All rights to indemnification and
exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to
the Effective Time (and rights to advancement of expenses) now existing in
favor of any Person who is or prior to the Effective Time becomes, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, a director, officer, employee
or agent (including as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan)
of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
predecessors (each, an " _Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company
Charter, the Company By-laws, the organizational documents of any Company
Subsidiary or any indemnification agreement between such Indemnified Party and
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the date hereof
(i) shall survive the Merger, (ii) shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms with respect to any claims against any such
Indemnified Party arising out of such acts or omissions and (iii) shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely
affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnified Party. Parent shall ensure
that the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing
obligations.

  


 

  

(b) Without limiting Section 6.07(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party
pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the acceptance for
payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to the Offer, in the event of any threatened or actual Proceeding,
whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or
arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer, employee or agent (including
as a fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any
of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii)
this Agreement or any of the Transactions, whether in any case asserted or
arising before or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees
and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any Proceeding to each
Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law upon
receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and
amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or
actual Proceeding. None of Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall settle,
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual
Proceeding for which indemnification could be sought by an Indemnified Party
hereunder, unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out
of such Proceeding or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to
such settlement, compromise or consent. Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall at their own expense cooperate with an Indemnified Party in the defense
of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification

  

 

47  

  


 

  

hereunder; provided that, absent an actual or potential conflict of interest,
in which case such Indemnified Party shall control and appoint its own lead
counsel at Parent's or the Surviving Corporation's expense, as applicable,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to control and appoint
lead counsel for such defense. Parent's and the Surviving Corporation's
obligations under this Section 6.07(b) shall continue in full force and effect
for the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by
Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and
ending six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all
rights to indemnification in respect of any Proceeding asserted or made within
such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Proceeding.

  


 

  

(c) The Company may obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or
"tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in respect of
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including for
acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement
and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period beginning upon the
acceptance for payment of, and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of
Company Common Stock pursuant to the Offer and ending six years from the
Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party and containing terms
(including with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including
with respect to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the
aggregate, no less favorable to any Indemnified Party than those of the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policies in effect on
the date of this Agreement (the " _Existing D andO Policies_"); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the maximum aggregate annual premium for such "tail"
insurance policies for any such year shall not exceed the maximum aggregate
annual premium contemplated by the second succeeding sentence. If such "tail"
insurance policies have been obtained by the Company, Parent shall cause such
"tail" insurance policies to be maintained in full force and effect, for their
full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be honored by the Surviving
Corporation. In the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance
policies, then, for the period beginning upon the acceptance for payment of,
and payment by Merger Sub for, any shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to
the Offer and ending six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain
in effect the Existing DandO Policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time (including for acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions); _provided_ , _however_ , that neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual premium for such
insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium payable by the
Company for coverage for its current fiscal year under the Existing DandO
Policies (which amount the Company represents and warrants is set forth in
Section 6.07(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter); _provided further_ that if
the annual premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount, Parent or
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous
policy available for an annual premium equal to such amount; and _provided
further_ that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a
reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms (including
with respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect
to deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no
less favorable to any Indemnified Party.

  

 

48  

  

(d) In the event that (i) the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors
or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its
properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any of its
successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in each
such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.07.

  


 

  

(e) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.07 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnified Party to whom this Section 6.07 applies without the
consent of such affected Indemnified Party. The provisions of this Section
6.07 are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in
addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to which each
Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  


 

  

(f) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.07.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.08. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as set forth in Section 6.02,
Section 6.07, this Section 6.08 and Section 6.10, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other Transactions shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not the Offer or the Merger is consummated.

  


 

  

(b) In the event that:

  


 

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(g);

  


 

  

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d); or

  


 

  

(iii) (A) after the date of this Agreement, a Company Takeover Proposal is
publicly proposed or announced or the making or existence of a Company
Takeover Proposal shall have otherwise become publicly known and such Company
Takeover Proposal is not publicly withdrawn (x) in the case of this Agreement
being subsequently terminated pursuant to Section 8.01(c), prior to the time
of the breach or failure to perform giving rise to such termination or (y) in
the case of this Agreement being subsequently terminated pursuant to Section
8.01(b)(i), prior to the date that is two business days prior to the final
expiration date of the Offer, (B) after such proposal becomes publicly known,
this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(b)(i) or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(c), (C) in the case
of a termination pursuant to Section 8.01(b)(i), at the final expiration date
of the Offer, the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (b) and (i) of Exhibit
A shall have been satisfied, but the Minimum Tender Condition shall not have
been satisfied and

  

 

49  

  


 

  

(D) within 9 months of such termination the Company enters into a definitive
agreement to consummate, or consummates, the transactions contemplated by a
Company Takeover Proposal,

  


 

  

then the Company shall pay to Parent a fee of $284,000,000 (the " _Company
Termination Fee_ "). For purposes of this Section 6.08(b), the term "Company
Takeover Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
5.03(h), except that all references to 20% in such definition shall be deemed
references to 50%. Any fee due under this Section 6.08(b) shall be paid by
wire transfer of same-day funds to an account designated by Parent, (1) in the
case of clause (i) above, prior to or simultaneously with such termination of
this Agreement, (2) in the case of clause (ii) above, within two business days
after the date of such termination of this Agreement and (3) in the case of
clause (iii) above, within two business days after the earlier of (x) the date
of entry into such definitive agreement or (y) the date of the consummation of
such Company Takeover Proposal. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
in no event shall the Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee
on more than one occasion, whether or not the Company Termination Fee may be
payable under more than one provision of this Agreement at the same or at
different times and the occurrence of different events.

(i) Parent or the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section

50  

  


 

  


 

  

(d) Acceptance by Parent of the fee due under Section 6.08(b)(i) shall
constitute acceptance by Parent of the validity of any termination of this

further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the Transactions. Acceptance by the Company of the fee due under Section
6.08(c) shall constitute acceptance by the Company of the validity of any
termination of this Agreement by Parent under Section 8.01(b). Except with

and material breach of this Agreement, payment of the Parent Termination Fee
described in this Section 6.08 shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company against Parent and Merger Sub and their respective current,
former or future Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of the

Termination Fee, none of Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective
current, former or future Representatives shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Transactions.

  


 

  

(e) Each Party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this _Section
6.08_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, no party would have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due to
Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.08_, or if Parent fails to promptly pay the
Regulatory Termination Fee (any such amount, a " _Payment_ "), and, in order
to obtain such Payment, the party entitled to receive such Payment (the "
_Recipient_ ") commences a legal action which results in a judgment against
the party obligated to make such Payment (the " _Payor_ ") for the applicable
Payment, or any portion thereof, the Payor shall pay to the Recipient its
costs and expenses incurred in connection with such legal action, together
with interest on the amount of such Payment at the publicly announced prime
rate of Citibank, N.A. from the date such payment was required to be paid to
(but excluding) the Payment date.

and the Company, on the other hand, shall consult with each other before
issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and comment upon,
any press release or other public statements with respect to the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be
required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with any national securities exchange and except as
specifically permitted or required by Section 5.03.

Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger Sub and
Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns with respect to such
Transfer Taxes.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.11. _Stockholder Litigation._ Prior to the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Article VIII, the Company shall promptly advise
Parent of any Proceeding commenced or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened by a stockholder against the Company or its directors relating to
any Transaction and shall keep Parent promptly and reasonably informed
regarding any such Proceeding. The Company shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense or settlement of any such Proceeding and shall
give due consideration to Parent's views with respect thereto; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall control such defense and this Section 6.11
shall not give Parent the right to direct such defense; and _provided_
_further_ , that no settlement of any such Proceeding shall be agreed to
without Parent's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned.

  


 

  

SECTION 6.12. _Rule 14d-10 Matters._ Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company
(acting through the Company Board and its Compensation Committee) shall take
all such steps as may be required to cause to be exempt under Rule 14d-10(d)

employee benefit arrangement that has been, or after the date of this
Agreement will be, entered into by the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries with current or future directors, officers, employees or other
service providers of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and to
ensure that any such arrangements fall within the safe harbor provisions of
such rule. Promptly upon Parent or any of its affiliates entering into any
such arrangement with any current or future director, officer, employee or

Parent will provide to the Company any and all information concerning such
arrangements as may be needed by the Company to comply with this Section 6.12.

or exchange offer subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act that

expiration date (as such expiration date may be extended and re-extended in
accordance with Section 1.01(a)), other than in accordance with this

54

SECTION 8.02. _Effect of Termination._ In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either the Company or Parent as provided in Section 8.01, this
Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand,
or the Company, on the other hand (except to the extent that such termination

stockholder premium), other than the last three sentences of Section 1.01(a),

if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The
failure of any party to this

  

 

55  

  


 

  

Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

A termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 or an amendment of
this Agreement or an extension or waiver with respect to this Agreement

obligations under Section 5.03(f), and (iii) the Company has paid, or

the Company makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with
respect to the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or with respect to

with the Transactions. Except in the case of fraud, neither the Company nor

obligation to Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person resulting from the
distribution to Parent or Merger Sub, or Parent's or Merger Sub's use of, any
such information, including any information, documents, projections, forecasts

63  

  


 

  

SECTION 9.09. _Assignment._ Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or
in part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties without the
prior written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign,
in its sole discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations
under this Agreement to Parent or to any direct or indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger Sub of any
of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.10. _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction._ (a) The parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even
if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly
agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, or
any other appropriate form of equitable relief, to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to in Section 9.10(b),
without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as a remedy
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The right to specific
enforcement shall include the right of the Company to cause Parent and Merger
Sub to cause the Offer, the Merger and the other Transactions to be
consummated on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement. The parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific
enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any
reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an
adequate remedy. Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without such right, none of the parties would have entered
into this Agreement. If, prior to the Outside Date, any party brings any
Proceeding, in each case in accordance with Section 9.10(b), to enforce
specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other
party, the Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of
time during which such Proceeding is pending, plus 20 business days or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such
Proceeding, as the case may be.

  


 

  

(b) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such
court shall be unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of
Delaware) for the purpose of any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other Transactions, and each of
the parties hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims with respect to such
Proceeding may be heard and determined exclusively in such court. Each of the
parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be
unavailable, any state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware) in
the event any Proceeding arises out of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
or any of the other Transactions, (ii) agrees

  

  

 

64  

  

   

that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) irrevocably
consents to the service of process in any Proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
Transactions, on behalf of itself or its property, by U.S. registered mail to
such party's respective address set forth in Section 9.02 ( _provided_ that
nothing in this Section 9.10(b) shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law) and (iv) agrees that it
will not bring any Proceeding relating to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or any of the other Transactions in any court other than the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if such court shall be unavailable, any
state or Federal court sitting in the State of Delaware). The parties hereto
agree that a final trial court judgment in any such Proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-judgment
relief regarding, or any appeal from, such final trial court judgment.

  


 

  

SECTION 9.11. _Waiver of Jury Trial._ Each party hereto hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement, the Offer,
the Merger or any other Transaction. Each party hereto (a) certifies that no
representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such party would not, in the event of any
Proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section
9.11.

Offer Conditions

  


 

  

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Agreement and Plan of
Merger to which this Exhibit A is attached, Merger Sub shall not be required
to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of the SEC,
including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger Sub's
obligation to pay for or return tendered shares of Company Common Stock
promptly after the termination or withdrawal of the Offer), pay for any shares
of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer unless (a) there shall
have been validly tendered in the Offer and "received" by the "depositary" (as
such terms are defined in Section 251(h) of the DGCL) and not properly
withdrawn prior to the expiration of the Offer that number of shares of
Company Common Stock (excluding for the avoidance of doubt all shares of
Company Common Stock delivered pursuant to guaranteed delivery instructions
for which certificates have not yet been delivered) which would represent one
more share than 50% of the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding at the time of the consummation of the Offer, including for the
purposes of this calculation, the aggregate number of shares of Company Common
Stock issuable to holders of Company Stock Options, Company Warrants, Company
Restricted Stock Units and Company Performance Stock Units (the " _Minimum
Tender Condition_ ") and (b) any waiting period (or any extension thereof)
applicable to the purchase of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to the
Offer and the consummation of the Merger under the HSR Act shall have expired
or been terminated without the imposition of a Burdensome Condition.
Furthermore, notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement,
Merger Sub shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause
Merger Sub to, accept for payment or, subject as aforesaid, to pay for any
shares of Company Common Stock not theretofore accepted for payment or paid
for if, at the expiration of the Offer, any of the following conditions
exists:

  


 

  

(i) there shall be any Legal Restraint in effect preventing or prohibiting the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger or imposing a Burdensome Condition;

  


 

  

(ii) (A) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Article
III (other than those set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.04, 3.08(a) and
3.20) shall not be true and correct at such time, except to the extent such
representation and warranty expressly relates to a specified date (in which
case on and as of such specified date), other than for such failures to be
true and correct that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (for purposes of
determining the satisfaction of this condition, without regard to any
qualifications or exceptions contained therein as to "materiality" or "Company
Material Adverse Effect"), (B) any

  

  

  

   

  

   


 

  

representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Section 3.02 (other
than 3.02(e)) shall not be true and correct other than in de minimis respects
at such time, except to the extent such representation and warranty expressly
relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date)
(C) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Sections 3.01,
3.02(e), 3.04 and 3.20 shall not be true and correct in all material respects
at such time, except to the extent such representation and warranty expressly
relates to a specified date (in which case on and as of such specified date),
and (D) any representation and warranty of the Company set forth in Section
3.08(a) shall not be true and correct in all respects at such time;

  


 

  

(iii) the Company shall have failed to comply with or perform in all material
respects all obligations to be performed by it as of such time under this
Agreement;

  


 

  

(iv) the Company shall have failed to deliver to Parent a certificate signed
by an executive officer of the Company, dated as of the date on which the
Offer expires, certifying that the Offer Conditions specified in the preceding
paragraphs (ii) and (iii) do not exist; or

  


 

  

(v) the Agreement shall have been terminated in accordance with its terms (the
" _Termination Condition_ ").

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify the Offer in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  


 

  

The foregoing conditions are for the sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable
rules and regulations of the SEC, may be waived by Parent and Merger Sub in
whole or in part at any time and from time to time in their sole discretion
(other than the Minimum Tender Condition and the Termination Condition). The
failure by Parent, Merger Sub or any other affiliate of Parent at any time to
exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any such
right, the waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts and
circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and
circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be
asserted at any time and from time to time. Capitalized terms used in this
Exhibit A and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth
in the Agreement and Plan of Merger to which this Exhibit A is attached.

director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any expense, liability or
loss incurred by such person in any such capacity or arising out of such
