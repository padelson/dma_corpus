. FDVI and American DandC understand and agree that the consummation of this
Agreement including the issuance of the FDVI common stock to the American DandC
Shareholders in exchange for the American DandC Shares as contemplated hereby
constitutes the offer and sale of securities under the Securities Act and
applicable state statutes. FDVI and American DandC agree that such transactions
shall be consummated in reliance on exemptions from the registration and
prospectus delivery requirements of such statutes, which depend, among other
items, on the circumstances under which such securities are acquired. In order
to provide documentation for reliance upon the exemptions from the
registration and prospectus delivery requirements for such transactions, each
Shareholder of American DandC hereby represents as follows:

 

 

(a) Each American DandC Shareholder is acquiring the shares of FDVI Common Stock
for investment for American DandC Shareholder's own account and not as a nominee
or agent, and not with a view to the resale or distribution of any part
thereof, and each Shareholder has no present intention of selling, granting
any participation in, or otherwise distributing the same. Each American DandC
Shareholder further represents that he does not have any contract,
undertaking, agreement or arrangement with any person to sell, transfer or
grant participation to such person or to any third person, with respect to any
of the shares of FDVI Common Stock.

 

 

(b) Each American DandC Shareholder represents and warrants that he or she: (i)
can bear the economic risk of his respective investments, and (ii) possesses
such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that he
is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of the investment in FDVI and
its securities.

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

(c) Each Shareholder who is not a "U.S. Person" as defined in Rule 902(k) of
Regulation S of the Securities Act ("Regulation S") (each a
"Non-U.S. Shareholder") understands that the shares of FDVI Common Stock are
not registered under the Securities Act and that the issuance thereof to such
American DandC Shareholder is intended to be exempt from registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to Regulation S. Each Non-U.S. Shareholder has no
intention of becoming a U.S. Person. At the time of the origination of contact
concerning this Agreement and the date of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, each Non-U.S. Shareholder was outside of the United States. Each
certificate representing the shares of FDVI Common Stock shall be endorsed
with the following legends, in addition to any other legend required to be
placed thereon by applicable federal or state securities laws:

 

 

 

"THE SECURITIES ARE BEING OFFERED TO INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT U.S. PERSONS (AS
DEFINED IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED
("SECURITIES ACT")) AND WITHOUT REGISTRATION WITH THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT IN RELIANCE UPON REGULATION S
PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT."

 

 

"TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES IS PROHIBITED, EXCEPT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PROVISIONS OF REGULATION S, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT,
OR PURSUANT TO AVAILABLE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION. HEDGING TRANSACTIONS MAY
NOT BE CONDUCTED UNLESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE SECURITIES ACT."

 

  

 

(d) Each American DandC Shareholder who is a "U.S. Person" as defined in Rule
902(k) of Regulation S as identified on Schedule 1.1 hereto (each a
"U.S. Shareholder") understands that the shares of FDVI Common Stock are not
registered under the Securities Act and that the issuance thereof to such
American DandC Shareholder is intended to be exempt from registration under the
Securities Act pursuant to Regulation D promulgated thereunder ("Regulation
D"). Each U.S. Shareholder represents and warrants that he is an "accredited
investor" as such term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D or, if not an
accredited investor, that such American DandC Shareholder otherwise meets the
suitability requirements of Regulation D and Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act ("Section 4(2)"). Each U.S. Shareholder agrees to provide documentation to
FDVI prior to Closing as may be requested by FDVI to confirm compliance with
Regulation D and/or Section 4(2), including, without limitation, a letter of
investment intent or similar representation letter and a completed investor
questionnaire. Each certificate representing the shares of FDVI Common Stock
issued to such American DandC Shareholder shall be endorsed with the following
legends, in addition to any other legend required to be placed thereon by
applicable federal or state securities laws:

 

 

  

 

"THIS SECURITY HAS BEEN ACQUIRED FOR INVESTMENT AND HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED ("SECURITIES ACT"), OR APPLICABLE
STATE SECURITIES OR "BLUE SKY" LAWS."

 

 

"TRANSFER OF THESE SECURITIES IS PROHIBITED UNLESS A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT WITH RESPECT TO SUCH SECURITY SHALL THEN BE IN EFFECT
AND SUCH TRANSFER HAS BEEN QUALIFIED UNDER ALL APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES OR
"BLUE SKY" LAWS, OR AN EXEMPTION THEREFROM SHALL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THE ACT
AND SUCH LAWS."

 

  

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

(e) Each American DandC Shareholder acknowledges that neither the SEC, nor the
securities regulatory body of any state or other jurisdiction, has received,
considered or passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of the information and
representations made in this Agreement.

 

 

(f) Each American DandC Shareholder acknowledges that he has carefully reviewed
such information as he has deemed necessary to evaluate an investment in FDVI
and its securities, and with respect to each U.S. Shareholder, that all
information required to be disclosed to such Shareholder under Regulation D
has been furnished to such American DandC Shareholder by FDVI. To the full
satisfaction of each Shareholder, he has been furnished all materials that he
has requested relating to FDVI and the issuance of the shares of FDVI Common
Stock hereunder, and each American DandC Shareholder has been afforded the
opportunity to ask questions of FDVI' representatives to obtain any
information necessary to verify the accuracy of any representations or
information made or given to the American DandC Shareholders. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing herein shall derogate from or otherwise modify the
representations and warranties of American DandC set forth in this Agreement, on
which each of the American DandC Shareholders have relied in making an exchange
of his Shares of the Company for the shares of Common Stock of FDVI.

 

 

(g) Each American DandC Shareholder understands that the shares of FDVI Common
Stock may not be sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of without
registration under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom, and that in
the absence of an effective registration statement covering the shares of
FDVI Common Stock or any available exemption from registration under the
Securities Act, the shares of FDVI Common Stock may have to be held
indefinitely. Each American DandC Shareholder further acknowledges that the
shares of FDVI Common Stock may not be sold pursuant to Rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act unless all of the conditions of Rule 144 are
satisfied (including, without limitation, FDVI compliance with the
reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
("Exchange Act")).

 

 

(h) The Shareholder agrees that, notwithstanding anything contained herein to
the contrary, the warranties, representations, agreements and covenants of the
Shareholder under this Section 4.08 shall survive the Closing.

 

 

(i) In connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, FDVI
and American DandC shall each file, with the assistance of the other and their
respective legal counsel, such notices, applications, reports, or other
instruments as may be deemed by them to be necessary or appropriate in an
effort to document reliance on such exemptions, and the appropriate regulatory
authority in the states where the shareholders of American DandC reside unless
an exemption requiring no filing is available in such jurisdictions, all to
the extent and in the manner as may be deemed by such parties to be
appropriate.

 

 

(j) In order to more fully document reliance on the exemptions as provided
herein, American DandC, the American DandC Shareholders, and FDVI shall execute
and deliver to the other, at or prior to the Closing, such further letters of
representation, acknowledgment, suitability, or the like as American DandC or
FDVI and their respective counsel may reasonably request in connection with
reliance on exemptions from registration under such securities laws.

 

 

(k) The American DandC Shareholders acknowledges that the basis for relying on
exemptions from registration or qualifications are factual, depending on the
conduct of the various parties, and that no legal opinion or other
assurance will be required or given to the effect that the transactions
contemplated hereby are in fact exempt from registration or qualification.

 

 

Section 4.09 Sales of Securities Under Rule 144, If Applicable.

 

 

(a) FDVI will use its best efforts to at all times satisfy the current public
information requirements of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act so
that its shareholders can sell restricted securities that have been held for
one year or more or such other restricted period as required by Rule 144 as
it is from time to time amended.

 

 

(b) Upon being informed in writing by any person holding restricted stock of
FDVI that such person intends to sell any shares under rule 144 promulgated
under the Securities Act (including any rule adopted in substitution or
replacement thereof), FDVI will certify in writing to such person that it is
compliance with Rule 144 current public information requirement to enable such
person to sell such person's restricted stock under Rule 144, as may be
applicable under the circumstances.

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

(c) If any certificate representing any such restricted stock is presented to
FDVI' transfer agent for registration or transfer in connection with any sales
theretofore made under Rule 144, provided such certificate is duly
endorsed for transfer by the appropriate person(s) or accompanied by a
separate stock power duly executed by the appropriate person(s) in each case
with reasonable assurances that such endorsements are genuine and effective,
and is accompanied by a legal opinion that such transfer has complied with the
requirements of Rule 144, as the case may be, FDVI will promptly instruct its
transfer agent to register such transfer and to issue one or more new
certificates representing such shares to the transferee and, if
appropriate under the provisions of Rule 144, as the case may be, free of any
stop transfer order or restrictive legend.

 

 

Section 4.10 Assistance with Post-Closing SEC Reports and Inquiries.

 

 

Upon the reasonable request of American DandC, after the Closing Date, the
Officers and Directors of FDVI shall use their reasonable best efforts to
provide such information available to it, including information, filings,
reports, financial statements or other circumstances of FDVI occurring,
reported or filed prior to the Closing, as may be necessary or required by
FDVI for the preparation of the reports that FDVI is required to file after
Closing with the SEC to remain in compliance and current with its reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act, or filings required to address and
resolve matters as may relate to the period prior to Closing and any SEC
comments relating thereto or any SEC inquiry thereof.
