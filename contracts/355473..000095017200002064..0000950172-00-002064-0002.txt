AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, among Johns
Manville Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and J Acquisition
Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent
("Acquisition Subsidiary"), dated as of December 19, 2000 (the
"Agreement").   WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary and the Company have approved this Agreement and
deemed this Agreement to be advisable and in the best interests of
stockholders and have approved the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the merger of Acquisition Subsidiary with and into the Company (the
"Merger") in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL");   WHEREAS, in
furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Acquisition
Subsidiary to promptly commence a tender offer to purchase any and all of the
issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (the "Company Common Stock"), at a price of $13.00 per share, net
to the seller in cash, without interest, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement (such tender offer, as it may be
amended and supplemented from time to time as permitted under this Agreement,
the "Offer"); and   WHEREAS, contemporaneously with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, as a condition and an inducement to the
willingness of Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary to enter into this
Agreement, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary are entering into an agreement
(the "Stockholder Agreement") with Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust
(the "Trust"), pursuant to which, on the terms and subject to the conditions
thereof, the Trust has agreed, among other things, to tender all shares of
Company Common Stock owned by it of record and beneficially in the Offer and
to vote such shares of Company Common Stock in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and approval of the transactions contemplated hereby;   NOW,
THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the
respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth
herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:   ARTICLE I   THE OFFER  
SECTION 1.1 The Offer.   (a) On the terms and subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the date hereof and in
any event not later than ten Business Days (as defined in Section 9.5) after
the date hereof Parent shall cause Acquisition Subsidiary to, and
Acquisition Subsidiary shall, commence within the meaning of Rule l4d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"),
the Offer. The obligation of Parent to cause Acquisition Subsidiary to, and
of Acquisition Subsidiary to, consummate the Offer and accept for payment
and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer shall
be subject only to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Annex
A; provided that, except for the condition that approval of the
Federal Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York (the "Court")
be obtained (which is set forth in paragraph (iii)(d) of Annex A) and
the condition set forth in paragraph (iii)(f) of Annex A, neither of which
may be waived without the Company\'s written consent, Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary may waive any other conditions to the Offer. Without
the prior written consent of the Company, no decrease in the per share price
or the number of shares of Company Common Stock sought in the Offer may be
made and no change may be made to the form of consideration to be paid for
the shares of Company Common Stock, and no other change to the Offer may
be made (i) which imposes conditions to the Offer in addition to those
set forth in Annex A, (ii) which extends the expiration date of the
Offer, except as permitted or required by Section 1.1(c) hereof or (iii) that
is otherwise adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.   (b) On the
date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall
file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (as amended and supplemented from time to time, the
"Schedule TO"), which shall comply in all material respects with applicable
provisions of the federal securities laws, and shall contain or incorporate
by reference the offer to purchase relating to the Offer and forms of the
related letter of transmittal and other appropriate documents (which
documents, as amended or supplemented from time to time, are referred to
herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). The Company will promptly
supply to Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary in writing, for inclusion in the
Offer Documents, appropriate information concerning the Company required
under the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Company
and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the Offer Documents before they are filed with the SEC. Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary agree to provide the Company and its counsel any
comments or communications, written or oral, which Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary or their counsel may receive from the staff of the SEC with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly upon receipt thereof. Each of Parent
and Acquisition Subsidiary, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other hand, shall promptly correct any information provided by either of them
for use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that it shall become
false or misleading, and Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary shall take all
steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so corrected to be filed with
the SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company as and to
the extent required by applicable law.   (c) The initial scheduled
expiration date of the Offer shall be 20 Business Days after the date of its
commencement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary shall extend the Offer (i) if at the scheduled expiration date of
the Offer (as extended hereby) (the "Expiration Date") any of the conditions
to the Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived, until such condition or
conditions are satisfied or waived unless such condition or conditions is or
are not, or could not reasonably be expected to be, satisfied by the
Termination Date (as defined in Section 8.1(c)(i)) and (ii) for any period
required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the SEC or
the staff thereof applicable to the Offer or any period required by
applicable law; provided however, except as required by law, no extension
pursuant to this Section 1.1 (c) shall be for more than five days unless the
Company shall have consented to such extension. Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary may extend the Offer for up to five business days beyond the
initial Expiration Date in the event that more than 85% but less than 90% of
the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock have been tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer (or are otherwise owned by Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary) at the initial Expiration Date; provided that Acquisition
Subsidiary then waives all conditions to the Offer (other than the conditions
set forth in paragraphs (iii)(d) and (iii)(f) of Annex A), neither of which
may be waived without the Company\'s written consent. Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary may not commence a subsequent offering period (as such term is
defined in Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act).   (d) Subject to the terms
and conditions of the Offer and this Agreement, Parent shall cause
Acquisition Subsidiary to, and Acquisition Subsidiary shall, accept for
payment shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not withdrawn
pursuant to the Offer as soon as it is legally permitted to do so under
applicable law and promptly pay for such shares of Company Common Stock.
Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Acquisition Subsidiary on a
timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of Company Common
Stock that Acquisition Subsidiary becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer.   (e) If Acquisition Subsidiary accepts for payment shares of
Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, it shall also purchase pursuant
to Section 23 of the Stockholder Agreement any shares of Company Common
Stock not tendered by the Trust in the Offer at a price per share not
greater than the price paid in the Offer. If Acquisition Subsidiary
purchases shares of Company Common Stock held by the Trust other than any
such shares tendered in the Offer, it shall have purchased all shares
tendered and not withdrawn in the Offer at a price not less than that paid to
the Trust.   SECTION 1.2 Company Actions. (a) On the date of commencement of
the Offer, the Company shall file or cause to be filed with the SEC
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (as amended
and supplemented from time to time, the "Schedule 14D-9"), and
shall disseminate the Schedule 14D-9 to shareholders of the Company as
required by Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act. To the
extent practicable, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary in mailing or otherwise disseminating the Schedule
14D-9 with the appropriate Offer Documents to the Company\'s shareholders.
The Schedule 14D-9 shall comply in all material respects with applicable
provisions of the federal securities laws. Parent and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
before it is filed with the SEC. The Company agrees to provide Parent and
its counsel any comments or communications, written or oral, which the
Company or its counsel may receive from the staff of the SEC with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly upon receipt thereof. Each of the Company, on
the one hand, and Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, on the other hand,
shall promptly correct any information provided by either of them for use in
the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent that it shall become false
or misleading, and the Company shall take all steps necessary to cause
the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and disseminated
to the shareholders of the Company as and to the extent required by
applicable laws.   (b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall
promptly furnish Parent, or cause Parent to be furnished, with mailing
labels, security position listings and any available listing or computer
file containing the names and addresses of the record holders of the shares
of Company Common Stock as of a recent date, and of those persons
becoming record holders after such date, and shall furnish Parent with
such information and assistance as Parent or its agents may reasonably
request in communicating the Offer to the shareholders of the Company.  
SECTION 1.3 Board of Directors Representation.   (a) Subject to compliance
with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14(f)-1 thereunder, effective
upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment for, shares of Company Common
Stock tendered in the Offer, Parent shall be entitled to designate such
number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, to serve on the
Board of Directors of the Company as will give Parent representation on the
Board of Directors of the Company equal to at least that number of directors
which equals the product of (i) the total number of directors on the Board of
Directors (giving effect to the election of any additional directors pursuant
to this section) and (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent and/or
Acquisition Subsidiary (including Company Common Stock accepted for payment
and for which payment has been made pursuant to the Offer or purchased and
paid for under the Stockholder Agreement) and the denominator of which shall
be the number of shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding. The Company
shall, upon request of Parent, take all reasonable actions to cause Parent\'s
designees to be elected or appointed to the Company\'s Board of Directors,
including without limitation, increasing the size of the Board of Directors
of the Company and/or securing the resignations of incumbent directors.
Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary will supply to the Company, and will be
solely responsible for, all information with respect to themselves,
their officers, directors and affiliates and their designees to the Board
of Directors of the Company required pursuant to Section 14(f) and
Rule 14(f)-1 of the Exchange Act.   (b) Following the election or
appointment of Parent\'s designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the
Effective Time, the parties shall use their respective best efforts to ensure
that the Company\'s Board of Directors shall have at least two directors who
are directors on the date of this Agreement and who are not officers of the
Company or affiliates of Parent (the "Continuing Directors"); provided that
in the event that the number of the Continuing Directors shall be reduced
below two for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Continuing Directors (or
the single Continuing Director, if there shall be only one remaining) shall
be entitled to designate a person who is not an officer of the Company or
an affiliate of Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary to fill such vacancies
and who shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for purposes of
this Agreement. Following the election or appointment of Parent\'s
designees pursuant to Section 1.3(a) and until the Effective Time, the
approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors shall be required to
authorize (i) any termination of this Agreement by the Company, (ii) any
amendment of this Agreement, (iii) any extension of time for performance of
any obligation of or action by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary hereunder,
(iv) any enforcement of or any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company, or
(v) any amendment to the Company\'s articles of incorporation or by-laws
that adversely affects any shareholders of the Company.   ARTICLE II  
THE MERGER   SECTION 2.1 The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to
the conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at
the Effective Time (as defined in Section 2.2 hereof), Acquisition
Subsidiary shall be merged with and into the Company. Upon the Merger, the
separate existence of Acquisition Subsidiary shall cease and the Company
shall continue as the surviving corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred
to as the "Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effect as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon the Merger, all the rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary
shall vest in the Surviving Corporation and all obligations, duties, debts
and liabilities of the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary shall be
the obligations, duties, debts and liabilities of the Surviving
Corporation.   SECTION 2.2 Effective Time. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, on the Closing Date (as defined in Section 2.3 hereof),
the Company and Acquisition Subsidiary will cause an appropriate Certificate
of Merger (the "Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with
the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "Secretary of State")
in such form and executed as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall
become effective on the date and at the time when the Certificate of Merger
has been duly filed with the Secretary of State or, subject to the DGCL,
such time as is agreed upon by the parties and specified in the Certificate
of Merger, and such time is hereinafter referred to as the "Effective
Time."   SECTION 2.3 Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have
been terminated and the transactions contemplated herein abandoned pursuant
to Section 8.1 and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
set forth in Article VII, the closing of the Merger (the "Closing") will
take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by
the parties, which shall be no later than the second Business Day (as
defined in Section 9.5) after satisfaction or waiver (by the party entitled
to waive the condition) of all of the conditions set forth in Article
VII hereof except for those conditions that by their nature cannot be
satisfied until the Closing, but subject to all such conditions having been
satisfied or waived at the time of the Closing) (the "Closing Date"), at the
offices of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP, Four Times Square, New
York, New York 10036, unless another date and/or place is agreed to by
the parties hereto.   SECTION 2.4 Certificate of Incorporation; By-laws.
Pursuant to the Merger, (i) the Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company, as amended (the "Restated Certificate of Incorporation"), as in
effect immediately prior to the Merger, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or
amended as provided therein or by applicable law, and (ii) the by-laws of the
Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Merger, shall be the by-laws
of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable law.   SECTION 2.5 Directors of the
Surviving Corporation. The directors of Acquisition Subsidiary immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the
directors of the Surviving Corporation until their successors shall have been
duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their earlier death,
resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporation\'s
certificate of incorporation and by-laws.   ARTICLE III   CONVERSION OF
SHARES   SECTION 3.1 Conversion of Capital Stock. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
Company, Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary, the holders of any Company Common
Stock, or the holders of any capital stock of Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary:   (a) Each issued and outstanding share of Company Common
Stock (other than shares of Company Common Stock to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 3.1(c) and the Dissenting Shares (as defined in
Section 3.4)) shall be converted into the right to receive, payable upon
surrender of the certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented issued and outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock (the "Common Stock Certificates") in the manner provided in Section
3.2, an amount equal to the price per share of Company Common Stock paid
pursuant to the Offer, payable to the holder thereof without interest.
Such consideration is referred to herein as the "Merger Consideration." All
such shares of Company Common Stock, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Common Stock Certificate shall
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock upon
the surrender of such certificate in accordance with Section 3.2. Any
payment made pursuant to this Section 3.1(a) shall be made net of
applicable withholding taxes to the extent such withholding is required by
law;   (b) Each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Acquisition
Subsidiary shall be converted into and become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation; and   (c)
All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by the Company as treasury
stock and all shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary or any Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary shall be
cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no Merger Consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor.   SECTION 3.2 Exchange of
Certificates.   (a) At least five Business Days prior to the Effective
Time, Acquisition Subsidiary shall designate the Company\'s registrar and
transfer agent, or such other bank or trust company as is reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, to act as paying agent for the holders of shares
of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger, pursuant to an
agreement providing for the matters set forth in this Section 3.2 and such
other matters as may be appropriate and the terms of which are
reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the payment
of the Merger Consideration. When and as needed, Parent and Acquisition
Subsidiary will cause to be deposited in trust with the Paying Agent for the
benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, as applicable, the
amount of cash necessary to complete the payments contemplated by this
Section 3.2 on a timely basis (the "Payment Fund"). Any interest income from
investment of such Payment Fund will be payable to Parent. If so directed by
Parent, the Paying Agent may invest such Payment Fund in overnight cash
equivalent investments.   At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
will instruct the Paying Agent to promptly, and in any event not later than
three Business Days following the Effective Time, mail to each holder of
record of Common Stock Certificates (the "Certificates"), whose shares were
converted pursuant to Section 3.1 into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of such Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall
be in such form and have such other provisions as the Company and
Acquisition Subsidiary may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for payment of
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation
to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed
by the Company, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed,
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common
Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, to be mailed within
three Business Days of receipt thereof, and the Certificate so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to
be made to a person or stock certificates are to be issued to a person
other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment or issuance that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise
in proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer and other taxes required by reason of the payment of
the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Corporation that such tax either has been paid or is
not applicable. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, the
Merger Consideration and any dividends or other distributions to which such
holder is entitled, may be issued with respect to such Company Common Stock
to such a transferee if the Certificates representing such Company
Common Stock are presented to the Paying Agent (or if lost, stolen or
destroyed, the procedures set forth in Section 3.2(d) are complied with),
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer
and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.  
(b) Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate
(other than Certificates representing Company Common Stock held by Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary, or any Subsidiary of Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary, or Dissenting Shares) shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Section 3.2. No interest shall
be paid or will accrue on any Merger Consideration payable to holders
of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article III.   (c) Any
portion of the Payment Fund which remains unclaimed by the former
stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand of the Surviving
Corporation, and all former stockholders of the Company shall thereafter look
only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of their claims for the Merger
Consideration for their shares.   (d) In the event any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person (as defined in Section 9.5) claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect thereof as determined in accordance with this Article
III, provided that the Person to whom the Merger Consideration is paid shall,
as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give the Surviving
Corporation a bond in such sum as the Surviving Corporation may direct or
otherwise indemnify the Surviving Corporation in a manner satisfactory to it
against any claim that may be made against the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Certificate claimed to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   (e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Surviving Corporation, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III, subject to Section 262
of the DGCL.   SECTION 3.3 Company Awards.   (a) Immediately following
the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the
Offer, each outstanding option (each, an "Option") to purchase shares of
Company Common Stock and each outstanding stock appreciation right with
respect to Company Common Stock (each, an "SAR") granted by the Company
pursuant to the Company\'s benefit plans (the "Option Plans") identified in
Section 3.3 of the disclosure letter separately delivered by the Company to
Acquisition Subsidiary and Parent on or prior to the date hereof (the
"Disclosure Letter"), whether or not exercisable, which is outstanding and
unexercised at such time, shall be cancelled and each holder thereof shall be
entitled to receive, immediately following the acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, an amount in cash
computed by multiplying (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the greater of (x) the
Merger Consideration and (y) the highest Fair Market Value (as defined in
the Company\'s 1996 Executive Incentive Compensation Plan) per Common Share
at any time during the 60-day period preceding the acceptance for payment
of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, over (B) the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Option or
grant price per share in respect of such SAR, as applicable (the "Spread"),
by (ii) the number of such shares of Company Common Stock then subject to
such Option or SAR; provided, that any such payment shall be net of
all withholding taxes required to be withheld by the Company.   (b)
Immediately following the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common
Stock tendered in the Offer, each share of deferred stock ("Deferred Stock")
awarded under the Option Plans shall be cancelled and each holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive, immediately following the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, with respect
to each share of Deferred Stock so cancelled, an amount in cash equal to the
greater of (x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the highest Fair Market Value
(as defined in the Company\'s 1996 Executive Incentive Plan) per share of
Company Common Stock at any time during the 60-day period preceding the
acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the
Offer (net of all withholding taxes required to be withheld by the
Company).   (c) Immediately following the acceptance for payment of shares
of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, (i) each unit in the
Company Deferred Compensation Plan deemed invested in assets other than in
shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive
cash in an amount equal to the value of such unit, payable to the holder
thereof without interest, and (ii) each unit deemed invested in shares of
Company Common Stock in the Deferral Account (as defined in the Company\'s
Deferred Compensation Plan and the Non-Employee Directors\' Deferred
Compensation Plan (together, the "Deferred Compensation Plans") (together
with the Option Plans, the "Benefit Plans")), including those Deferral
Accounts with respect to which one or more installment payments have
previously been made, shall be settled in cash in an amount equal to the
Merger Consideration, provided, that any such payment shall be net of
all withholding taxes required to be withheld by the Company.  
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.3 to the contrary, in no event
will the Company have an obligation hereunder that violates the terms of the
applicable Benefit Plans. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall at
the request of Parent, seek any required consents from, and provide any
required notices to, the holders of Options and Deferred Stock; provided
however, that the Company shall not be required to make any payment in
respect of the foregoing (other than as set forth in Sections 3.3(a), (b) and
(c)).   SECTION 3.4 Dissenter\'s Rights. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who
has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written demand
for appraisal of such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL,
if such Section 262 provides for appraisal rights for such shares of
Company Common Stock in the Merger ("Dissenting Shares"), shall not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, as provided in
Section 3.1 hereof, unless and until such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or otherwise loses his right to appraisal and payment
under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect or effectively withdraws or loses his right to appraisal, such
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted as
of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration,
without interest thereon.   ARTICLE IV   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
OF THE COMPANY   The Company represents and warrants to Acquisition
Subsidiary and Parent that:   SECTION 4.1 Organization. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section 9.5(v)) is a corporation or other
entity duly incorporated or organized, as the case may be, validly existing,
and in good standing (but, with respect to Subsidiaries not organized in
the United States, only to the extent such concept is applicable) under
the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, has
all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted,
and is qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or
to have such power and authority, or to be so qualified or licensed would
not have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 9.5(ii)).
The Restated Certificate of Incorporation and by-laws of the Company
(the "By-Laws") are in the form currently filed with the SEC.   SECTION 4.2
Capitalization.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists
of 300,000,000 shares of Company Common Stock, 7,200,000 shares of
Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $1.00 per share (the
"Convertible Preferred Stock") and 11,109,170 shares of Cumulative Preference
Stock, Series B, par value $1.00 per share (the "Cumulative Preferred
Stock"). As of the date hereof, (i) 147,868,551 shares of Company Common
Stock are issued and outstanding, (ii) 17,010,046 shares of Company Common
Stock are issued and held in the treasury of the Company, and (iii) there are
no shares of Convertible Preferred Stock or Cumulative Preferred Stock
issued and outstanding or held in treasury and (iv) 12,804,482 shares of
Company Common Stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of Options, SARs
or Deferred Stock under the Option Plans or Deferred Compensation Plans.
No bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness having the right to vote
(or convertible into or exchangeable for securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which stockholders of the Company may vote are issued
or outstanding. All the outstanding shares of the Company\'s capital stock
are, and all shares which may be issued or granted pursuant to the exercise
of Options, SARs, or Deferred Stock will be, when issued or granted
in accordance with the respective terms thereof, duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable. Except as set forth in
Section 4.2(a) of the Disclosure Letter as of the date hereof and for
the transactions contemplated hereby, there are no existing (i)
options, warrants, calls, pre-emptive rights, subscriptions or other
rights, convertible securities, agreements or commitments of any
character obligating the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue,
transfer or sell any shares of capital stock or other equity interest in, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such shares or equity interests, (ii) contractual
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem
or otherwise acquire any capital stock or other equity interest of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company or (iii) voting trusts or similar
agreements to which the Company is a party with respect to the voting of the
capital stock of the Company.   (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b)
of the Disclosure Letter, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock (or
equivalent equity interests of entities other than corporations) of each of
the Company\'s Subsidiaries are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly,
by the Company free and clear of any mortgage, lien, pledge, charge,
encumbrance or other security interest (including any restriction on the
right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or ownership
interests) (collectively, "Liens"), other than such restrictions as may exist
under applicable statute and all such shares or other ownership interests
have been duly authorized, validly issued and are fully paid and non-
assessable.   SECTION 4.3 Authorization; Validity of Agreement.   (a) The
Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and, subject to any approval of its stockholders that
may be required pursuant to applicable law as contemplated by Section 6.6
hereof, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and
delivery by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly approved and authorized by
the Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") and, other than adoption
of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock if required pursuant to applicable law, no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to approve and
authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement and approval of by the
Company and the consummation by it of the transactions contemplated hereby.
This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and,
assuming due authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by
Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary, is a valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
that such enforcement may be subject to or limited by (i) bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, affecting
creditors\' rights generally, and (ii) the effect of general principles of
equity (regardless of whether enforceability is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity).   (b) The Board has adopted such resolutions as are
necessary so that the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL are inapplicable
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company does not know
of any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition,"
"interested shareholder" or other similar anti-takeover statute or regulation
that is, or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the Company, the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement.   SECTION 4.4 No Violations; Approvals.   (a) Neither the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation
by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) violate any
provision of the Restated Certificate of Incorporation or By-laws of the
Company or violate any provision of the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or other organizational documents with respect to non-incorporated
entities) of its Subsidiaries, (ii) except as set forth in Section 4.4(a) of
the Disclosure Letter, result in a violation or breach of, or constitute
(with or without due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or give rise
to any right of termination, amendment, cancellation, acceleration or the
creation of a Lien, other than a Permitted Exception, pursuant to), or
require any consent of any third party pursuant to, any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any material note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
guarantee, other evidence of indebtedness, lease, license, contract,
collective bargaining agreement, agreement or other instrument or obligation
to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any of
them or any of their assets may be bound or (iii) violate any order,
writ, injunction, decree, statute, rule or regulation applicable to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their properties or assets; except
in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) for such violations, breaches,
defaults, rights, creation of Liens or failure to obtain consents which would
not have a Material Adverse Effect.   (b) No filing or registration with,
notification to, or authorization, consent or approval of, any court,
legislative, executive or regulatory authority or agency (a "Governmental
Entity") is legally required in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by the Company or the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) applicable requirements under
Competition Laws (as defined below), (ii) applicable requirements under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), (iii) the
filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State, (iv)
applicable requirements under corporation, takeover or "blue sky" laws of
various states or non-United States change-in-control or investment laws
or regulations, (v) applicable requirements under Environmental Laws
(as defined in Section 4.15) and (vi) such other consents, approvals,
orders, permits, authorizations, notifications, registrations, declarations
and filings the failure of which to be obtained or made would not
either individually, or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse
Effect. "Competition Laws" means statutes, rules, regulations, orders,
decrees, administrative and judicial doctrines of applicable Governmental
Entities that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate
actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization, lessening of
competition or restraint of trade and includes the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and, to the
extent applicable, equivalent laws of the European Union or the Member
States thereof.   SECTION 4.5 SEC Reports and Financial Statements. The
Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") all
forms and documents required to be filed by it since January 1, 1997 under
the Exchange Act and has heretofore made available to Parent (i) its
Annual Reports on Form 10-K for the years ended December 31, 1997, December

and September 30, 2000 and (iv) all other forms, reports and
registration statements filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1,
1997 (other than registration statements on Form S-8 or preliminary materials
and registration statements in forms not declared effective). The
documents described in clauses (i)-(iv) above, as amended, are referred to in
this Agreement collectively as the "Company SEC Documents". As of
their respective dates, the Company SEC Documents, including the
financial statements and schedules provided therein or incorporated by
reference therein, (a) did not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (b) complied in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act
and the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), as the
case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder.
The consolidated financial statements included or incorporated by reference
in the Company SEC Documents have been prepared in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") applied on
a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as otherwise
noted therein and except that the quarterly financial statements are subject
to year end adjustment and do not contain all footnote disclosures required
by GAAP) and fairly present in all material respects the
consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of operations
and cash flows of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the
dates thereof or for the periods presented therein.   SECTION 4.6 Absence
of Certain Changes. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents or as

until the date of this Agreement, (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries have
conducted their operations in the ordinary course, (ii) there has not been a
Material Adverse Effect and (iii) the Company and its Subsidiaries have not
taken any of the following actions:   (a) declared, set aside or paid
(other than dividends paid by Subsidiaries to the Company or other wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of the Company) any dividend or other distribution payable
in cash, stock or property with respect to its capital stock (other than the
declaration, setting aside or payment of regular quarterly dividends not
exceeding $.06 per share of Company Common Stock);   (b) incurred any
material indebtedness for money borrowed or issued or sold any debt
securities or warrants or rights to acquire any debt securities of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or guaranteed any material indebtedness for money
borrowed other than under credit facilities in the ordinary course of
business and other than borrowings in the ordinary course of business that
can be repaid at any time without prepayment penalty or other similar
fees;   (c) granted any material increase in the fringe benefits
or compensation payable or to become payable by the Company to any officer
or director of the Company, except for normal increases in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice or to reflect promotions or
new hires;   (d) other than in the ordinary course of business consistent
with past practice, sold, leased, mortgaged, encumbered or otherwise
disposed of, any material assets (including capital stock of
Subsidiaries);   (e) has not been a constituent party in any merger or
consolidation with, or purchased an equity interest in all or substantially
all of the assets (which assets shall be material to the Company) of, any
Person or other business organization or any division or business thereof;
or   (f) agreed to take any of the foregoing actions identified
in subparagraphs (a) through (e) above.   SECTION 4.7 Absence of
Undisclosed Liabilities. Except as expressly identified in the Company SEC
Documents, or as reflected or reserved against in the balance sheet dated as
of December 31, 1999 or the balance sheet dated as of September 30, 2000
constituting a portion of the financial statements included in the Company\'s
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the term ended December 31, 1999 and the
Company\'s quarterly report filed on Form 10-Q, respectively (the "Balance
Sheets") or in the notes thereto and except for liabilities in respect of
Litigation (which are the subject of Section 4.10) and liabilities under
Environmental Laws (which are the subject of Section 4.15), neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries had as of that date any liabilities which
were material to the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole and which
were required to be set forth in the Balance Sheets or the notes thereto in
accordance with GAAP. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, since
September 30, 2000, the Company has not incurred any liabilities that would
be required to be reflected or reserved against in a consolidated balance
sheet of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP,
except for such liabilities as would not have a Material Adverse Effect,
liabilities resulting from the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
relating to the transactions contemplated hereby and except for liabilities
in respect of Litigation (which are the subject of Section 4.10) and
liabilities under Environmental Laws (which are the subject of Section
4.15).   SECTION 4.8 Information in Disclosure Documents. The
Schedule 14D-9, the Proxy Statement (defined in Section 6.6(c)), if any, and
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto (collectively, the
"Company Disclosure Documents"), will not contain, at the date mailed to
Company stockholders, any false or misleading statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not false or misleading, and the Schedule 14D-9
and the Proxy Statement, if any, will comply in all material respects with
the applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder; except that no representation is made by the Company
with respect to statements made in the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy
Statement, if any, based on information supplied by Parent or Acquisition
Subsidiary for inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, if
any.   SECTION 4.9 Employee Benefit Plans; ERISA.   (a) Section 4.9(a) of
the Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of each material
"employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA and each bonus,
deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock purchase, stock option,
stock award, severance or termination benefit, hospitalization or other
medical, life or other insurance, supplemental unemployment benefits, profit-
sharing, pension, or retirement plan, program, agreement or arrangement, each
employment, retention or severance agreement or arrangement which cannot be
terminated in fewer than three months or without liability exceeding the
greater of one month\'s salary or one week of salary for each year of service
and each other material employee benefit plan, program, agreement or
arrangement, sponsored, maintained or contributed to by the Company or by any
trade or business, whether or not incorporated (an "ERISA Affiliate"), that
together with the Company would be deemed a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 4001 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), for the benefit of any employee or former
employee or director of the Company or any ERISA Affiliate employed in the
United States (the "Plans").   (b) No liability under Title IV of ERISA has
been incurred by the Company or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been
satisfied in full, and no condition exists that presents a material risk to
the Company or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title,
other than liability for contributions due in the ordinary course and
premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation ("PBGC") (which
contributions and premiums have been paid when due) except for such
liabilities that would not have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) No Plan
that is an "employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA (an
"ERISA Plan"), is a "multiemployer pension plan," as defined in Section 3(37)
of ERISA, nor is any ERISA Plan a plan described in Section 4063(a) of
ERISA.   (d) No ERISA Plan or any trust established thereunder has
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of
ERISA and Section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the "Code"), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the most
recent fiscal year of each ERISA Plan ended prior to the Closing Date. Each
ERISA Plan intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code has been determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be so
qualified (or timely application has been made therefor); no event has
occurred since the date of such determination that would materially adversely
affect such qualification; and each trust maintained thereunder has been
determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be exempt from taxation under
Section 501(a) of the Code. All contributions or other payments required to
have been made by Company and its Subsidiaries to or under any Plan
by applicable law or the terms of such Plan have been timely and
properly made. Each Plan has been operated and administered in all material
respects in accordance with its terms and applicable law, including but not
limited to ERISA and the Code except where a failure to so operate or
administer would not have a Material Adverse Effect. There are no pending, or
to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, material claims by or on behalf
of any Plan, by any employee or beneficiary covered under any such Plan,
or otherwise involving any such Plan (other than routine claims for
benefits).   (e) Except as disclosed in Schedule 4.9(e) of the Disclosure
Letter or in connection with equity compensation or otherwise disclosed
or referred to in this Section 4.9 (or in Section 4.9 of the
Disclosure Letter), neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will, without
further action (i) result in any payment becoming due to any current or
former employee or director of Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) increase
any benefits under any Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any benefits, (iv) satisfy any condition
or requirement entitling any current or former employee or director of
Company and its Subsidiaries to additional rights or features with respect to
any benefits, or (v) result in any payment becoming due by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or Acquisition Subsidiary that would be subject
to Sections 162(m), 280G or 4999 of the Code.   (f) Section 4.9(f) of the
Disclosure Letter identifies each Employment Agreement containing a provision
for "Good Reason" or similar terms relating to the potential termination of
the employee\'s employment with the Company in connection with the
consummation of the Offer or the Merger. Neither the Company nor its
Subsidiaries has taken any corporate action acknowledging that an individual
party to a Listed Employee Agreement will have, upon consummation of the
Offer or the Merger, "Good Reason" or a similar right (as that term is
defined in such Listed Employee Agreement) to terminate his or her employment
thereunder with the Company.   (g) With respect to each Plan that is not
subject to United States law (a "Foreign Plan"):   (i) Except as disclosed
in Schedule 4.9(g) of the Disclosure  Letter, with respect to each Foreign
Plan, any liability for  accrued benefit obligations has been funded (through
insurance or  otherwise) or a book reserve account has been established (in
each  case sufficient to procure or provide for the accrued benefit 
obligations in accordance with GAAP), and each such account is  reflected on
the Balance Sheets except for such liability for  accrued benefit obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of  business consistent with past practice
since December 31, 1999 or  otherwise disclosed in the Company SEC Documents;
and   (ii) each Foreign Plan required to be registered has been  registered
and has been maintained in good standing with applicable  regulatory
authorities.   SECTION 4.10 Litigation; Compliance with Law.   (a) Except
as expressly identified in the Company SEC Documents or Section 4.10 of the
Disclosure Letter and except for claims under Environmental Laws (which are
the subject of Section 4.15), there is no suit, claim, action, proceeding or
investigation pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, individually or
together with other suits, claims, actions, proceedings or investigations
involving related or substantially similar allegations, would have a Material
Adverse Effect.   (b) Except as expressly identified in the Company SEC
Documents and except for Environmental Laws (which are the subject of Section
4.15), the operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries are not being
conducted in violation of any law, statute, regulation, judgment, decree,
order or injunction of any Governmental Entity, except where such violations
would not have a Material Adverse Effect.   (c) The Company and its
Subsidiaries hold all licenses, permits, variances and approvals of
Governmental Entities necessary for the lawful conduct of their respective
businesses as currently conducted except for licenses, permits, variances or
approvals under Environmental Laws (which are the subject of Section 4.15)
and except where the failure to hold such licenses, permits, variances or
approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
Adverse Effect.   (d) Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(d) of the
Disclosure Letter, or as set forth in the Balance Sheets, neither the Company
nor any of its Subsidiaries has, as of the date therein, any liabilities
associated with the matters contemplated by this Section 4.10 which would be
required to be reflected or reserved against in a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP, except
for such liabilities as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Material Adverse Effect.   SECTION 4.11 Intellectual Property. The
Company and its Subsidiaries own free and clear of any Lien, other than
Permitted Exceptions, or possess licenses or other valid rights to use, all
patents, patent rights, domain names, trademarks (registered or
unregistered), trade dress, trade names, copyrights (registered or
unregistered), service marks, trade secrets, know-how and other confidential
or proprietary rights and information, inventions, processes, formulae, as
well as all goodwill symbolized by any of the foregoing (collectively,
"Intellectual Property") necessary in connection with the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted, except where the failure
to possess such rights or licenses would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as disclosed in Section
4.11 of the Disclosure Letter, (i) the conduct, products or services of the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted do not
infringe upon any Intellectual Property of any third party except where
such infringement would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) there are no claims or suits pending or for
which written notice has been provided or, to the knowledge of the
Company, threatened (A) alleging that the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
conduct, products or services infringe upon any Intellectual Property of any
third party except where such infringement would not, individually or in
the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, or (B) challenging the
Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' ownership of, right to use, or the validity
or enforcement of any license or other agreement relating to, the
Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' Intellectual Property, and (ii) to the
knowledge of the Company, no Person is infringing upon any Intellectual
Property of the Company or its Subsidiaries except where such infringement
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will not result in the loss of, or
any encumbrance on, the rights of the Company or any Subsidiary with respect
to the Intellectual Property owned or used by them, except where such loss
or encumbrance would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
Material Adverse Effect. All Intellectual Property necessary in connection
with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries is valid,
subsisting, enforceable and, where applicable, has been properly maintained,
except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material

Proposals.   (a) The Company agrees that, except as expressly contemplated
by this Agreement, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries shall, and
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall instruct their respective officers
or directors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants, financial
advisors, agents or other representatives not to (i) initiate, solicit,
encourage or knowingly facilitate the making of any Acquisition Proposal (as
hereinafter defined) or (ii) except as permitted below, engage in
negotiations or discussions with, or furnish any non-public information or
data to, any third party relating to an Acquisition Proposal (other than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in this Agreement, until the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock in the Offer, and subject to
the provisions of Section 6.2(b) and (c), the Company and the Board (i)
may participate in negotiations or discussions (including, as a part
thereof, making any counterproposal) with or furnish information or data to
any third party pursuant to a customary confidentiality agreement, if the
Board determines in good faith, after receiving the advice of its
financial advisors, that a third party has made after the date hereof a
Superior Proposal or an Acquisition Proposal that the Board concludes would
be reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal (and such
Acquisition Proposal was not solicited by the Company or any director,
affiliate or agent of the Company at the explicit or implicit direction of
the Company), (ii) shall be permitted to (X) take and disclose to the holders
of the Company Common Stock a position with respect to the Merger or
another Acquisition Proposal (including a Superior Proposal), or amend or
withdraw such position, if, based on the advice of independent counsel, the
Board determines that such action is required pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and
14e-2 under the Exchange Act and (Y) make disclosure to stockholders as the
Board determines after consultation with independent counsel is necessary
to comply with the Board\'s duties under applicable law and (iii) shall
be permitted to request from any Person making an Acquisition Proposal
such information as may be necessary for the Board to inform itself as to
the material terms of the Acquisition Proposal. Immediately after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries
will, and will instruct their respective officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other agents to, cease and
terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
parties conducted heretofore with respect to any possible Acquisition
Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the necessary steps to
promptly inform its officers, directors, investments bankers, attorneys,
accountants, financial advisors, agents or other representatives involved in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement of the obligations undertaken
in this Section 6.2(a).   (b) In addition to the obligations of the Company
set forth in paragraph (a) above, the Company shall advise Acquisition
Subsidiary orally and in writing by the end of the next Business Day, but in
no event more than 36 hours after its receipt, of any written request for
information or of any Acquisition Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such request or Acquisition Proposal and the identity of the
person making any such request or Acquisition Proposal and any determination
by the Board that an Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal or would be
reasonably likely to constitute a Superior Proposal. The Company will keep
Acquisition Subsidiary reasonably informed as to the status and material
terms and conditions of any such request or Acquisition Proposal.   (c) If
the Board is entitled to engage in negotiations or discussions with, or
furnish any information or data to, any third party on the terms contemplated
in Section 6.2(a), the Board may, prior to the acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, (i) withdraw or modify,
or propose publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Acquisition
Subsidiary, the approval or recommendation by the Board of the Merger or this
Agreement, (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or
recommend, a Superior Proposal or (iii) cause the Company to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or other
similar agreement related to a Superior Proposal. The Board may only take the
actions described in clause (iii) of this subparagraph (c) if this Agreement
has terminated in accordance with the procedures contemplated in
Section 8.1(d), including following the expiration of the five Business Day
period contemplated therein and the Company having paid any required
Termination Fee and Expenses as contemplated therein.   (d) For purposes of
this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" shall mean any bona fide proposal for
the (i) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of a business or assets
that constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or the assets
(based on the fair market value thereof) of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, (ii) direct or indirect acquisition or purchase of 15% or
more of any class of equity securities or capital stock of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of the net
revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, or (iii) merger, consolidation, restructuring, transfer of assets or
other business combination, sale of shares of capital stock, tender offer,
exchange offer, recapitalization, stock repurchase program or other similar
transaction that if consummated would result in any person or persons
beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries whose business constitutes 15% or more of
the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, other than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
The term "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide proposal to the
Company, which was not solicited by the Company or any director, affiliate or
agent of the Company at the explicit or implicit direction of the Company,
to enter into an Acquisition Proposal made by a third party on terms
and conditions which the Board determines in its good faith judgment,
after receiving the advice of its financial advisors, to be more favorable to
the holders of the Company Common Stock from a financial point of view than
the transactions contemplated hereby (taking account of all of the
terms thereof, including price, likelihood of financing being obtained
and likelihood and expected timing of consummation).   SECTION 6.3 Access
to Information. From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the
Company shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to afford to
Acquisition Subsidiary and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel and
its authorized representatives reasonable access during normal business hours
upon reasonable prior notice to all of its books, records, assets, properties
(provided that no environmental testing may be performed) and operations and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish promptly to Acquisition
Subsidiary (i) a copy of each report, letter, registration statement and
other document filed or received by it during such period pursuant to the
requirements of the Exchange Act, (ii) a copy of all correspondence,
including pleadings, relating to the obtaining of the order referred to in
paragraph (iii)(d) of Annex A and (iii) such other information used in the
operation of its business as Acquisition Subsidiary may reasonably request
and the provision of which is not inconsistent with applicable laws and would
not breach any agreements. Acquisition Subsidiary and its authorized
representatives will conduct all such inspections in a manner which will
minimize any disruptions of the business and operations of the Company and
its Subsidiaries. Until the Effective Time, each of Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary will hold such information confidential and will not
disclose such information to any third party other than their officers,
directors, employees, agents and advisors and other representatives who need
to know such information in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby (their "Representatives"), or use it for any purpose other than
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the
extent it is required to do so by legal process following notice to the
Company, and will cause such information to be so held by their
Representatives. Upon a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.1, Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and its Representatives shall return to
the Company (and hold confidential) all information provided pursuant to this
Section 6.3 and all materials in their possession reflecting such
information.   SECTION 6.4 Further Action; Commercially Reasonable
Efforts.   (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein
provided, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially reasonable
efforts to satisfy the conditions precedent to the obligations of any of the
parties hereto, to obtain all necessary authorizations, consents and
approvals, and to effect all necessary registrations and filings. Each of the
parties hereto will furnish to the other parties and to the Trust such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as such other parties or the
Trust may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing and will
provide the other parties with copies of all filings made by such party with
any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to
a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.   (b) Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and
the Company shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
resolve such objections, if any, as may be asserted with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby under the laws, rules, guidelines or
regulations of any Governmental Entity. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Company and Parent shall, as soon as practicable, file or cause to be filed
Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act (as defined below) with the
Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice (the "Antitrust Division") and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to all inquiries
received from the FTC or the Antitrust Division for additional information
or documentation.   (c) In case at any time after the Effective Time any
further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this
Agreement, the proper officers and/or directors of the Surviving Corporation
shall take or cause to be taken all such necessary action.   (d) Each of
the parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry
of, and to cause to be discharged or vacated, any order or injunction of a
Governmental Entity precluding, restraining, enjoining or prohibiting
consummation of the Merger.   SECTION 6.5 Employee Benefits.   (a) The
Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent agrees not to interfere with the
ability of the Surviving Corporation to honor, and to make required payments
when due under, all contracts, agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and
commitments of the Company and its Subsidiaries in effect as of the date
hereof which are applicable with respect to any employee, officer, director
or executive or former employee, officer, director or executive of the
Company or any Subsidiary thereof, including the Benefit Plans in existence
as of the date hereof. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the
Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating such contracts,
agreements, arrangements, policies, plans and commitments in accordance with
the terms thereof and with applicable law.   (b) The Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent agrees not to interfere with the ability of the Surviving
Corporation to, assume each employment, retention, consulting or severance
agreement or arrangement that was entered into by and between the Company and
any employee, officer, director or executive or former employee, officer,
director or executive of the Company or any Subsidiary thereof and that is in
effect as of the date hereof and has been made available to Acquisition
Subsidiary as of the date hereof.   (c) The Surviving Corporation hereby
agrees, and Parent agrees not to interfere with the ability of the Surviving
Corporation, after the Effective Time, to continue to maintain until the
first anniversary of the Closing Date the core benefits identified on
Schedule 6.5 of the Disclosure Letter for the benefit of employees and former
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries which in the aggregate provide
benefits that are not materially less favorable taken as a whole (on a value
or cost basis) than those provided to them under the Benefit Plans on the
date hereof (it being understand that there shall be no obligation to
maintain plans that provide for the issuance of any equity securities in the
Surviving Corporation). In addition, the Surviving Corporation hereby agrees,
and Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation, for a period of
eighteen months immediately following the Effective Time, to continue to
maintain the Company Separation Policy as in effect on the date hereof,
without any amendment thereto which is adverse to the participants
therein.   (d) For purposes of all employee benefit plans, programs
and arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation shall cause, and
Parent agrees not to interfere with the ability of the Surviving Corporation
to cause, each such plan, program or arrangement to treat the prior
service with the Company and its affiliates of each person who is an employee
or former employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a "Company Employee") (to the same extent such service
is recognized under analogous plans, programs or arrangements of the
Company or its affiliates prior to the Effective Time) as service rendered to
the Surviving Corporation, for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting; provided, however, that any benefits provided by the
Surviving Corporation under any (i) ERISA Plan, (ii) nonqualified employee
benefit or deferred compensation plans, stock option, bonus or incentive
plans or (iii) other employee benefit or fringe benefit programs, that may be
in effect generally for employees of the Surviving Corporation or
its Subsidiaries from time to time, shall be reduced by benefits in respect
of the same years of service under analogous plans, programs and
arrangements maintained by or contributed to by the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or their Subsidiaries. The Surviving Corporation shall (x) waive
all limitations as to preexisting conditions exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Company Employees under any welfare benefit plans that such
Company Employees may be eligible to participate in after the Effective Time,
other than limitations or waiting periods that are already in effect with
respect to such employees and that have not been satisfied as of the
Effective Time under any welfare benefit plan maintained for the Company
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) provide each
Company Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior
to the Effective Time in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-
pocket requirements under any welfare plans that such employees are eligible
to participate in after the Effective Time.   (e) The Surviving Corporation
shall pay (no later than February 15, 2001) to each individual who was a
participant in any of the Company\'s annual incentive compensation plans
(each, a "Bonus Plan") immediately prior to the Effective Time, a lump sum
cash payment equal to the amount approved for such individual on December 7,
2000 by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors.   SECTION 6.6
Stockholders Meeting; Proxy Statement.   (a) If required by the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and/or applicable law in order to consummate the
Merger, the Company shall take all action necessary in accordance with the
DGCL and its Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws duly to call, give
notice of, convene and hold a meeting of the Company\'s stockholders (the
"Special Meeting") as promptly as practicable following the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer for purpose
of considering and taking action upon this Agreement and the Merger. At the
Special Meeting, all of the Company Common Stock then owned by Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary or any other subsidiary of Parent shall be voted in
favor of adoption of the Agreement and to approve the Merger (subject to
applicable law). Subject to the fiduciary obligations of the Board under
applicable law, if such vote is sought, the Board shall recommend that the
Company\'s stockholders vote in favor of adoption of the Agreement and to
approve the Merger, shall use its commercially reasonable best efforts to
solicit from stockholders of the Company proxies and shall take all other
action in its judgment necessary or appropriate to secure the vote of
stockholders required by the DGCL to effect the Merger. The Company shall
cause such recommendation of the Board referred to in the immediately
preceding sentence to be included in the Proxy Statement.   (b)
Notwithstanding Section 6.6(a), in the event that Parent, Acquisition
Subsidiary or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall have acquired at least 90%
of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer or
otherwise, the parties hereto agree to take all necessary or appropriate
action to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the
Offer without a meeting of stockholders of the Company, in accordance with
Section 253 of the DGCL.   (c) If required under applicable law, the Company
shall prepare a definitive proxy statement, file it with the SEC under the
Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the acceptance for payment of
shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, and use all
commercially reasonable best efforts to have such proxy statement cleared by
the SEC (the "Proxy Statement"). Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary and the
Company shall cooperate with each other in the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, and the Company shall notify Parent of the receipt of any comments
of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any requests by the SEC
for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and
shall provide to Parent promptly copies of all correspondence between the
Company or any representative of the Company and the SEC. The Company shall
give Parent and its counsel the opportunity to review and comment thereon. If
at any time after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to stockholders
and prior to the Special Meeting any information relating to the
Company, Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by the Company, Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary which is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement will not
include any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, the party which discovers
such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and to the extent required by law, disseminated
to the stockholders. Parent and Acquisition Subsidiary agree that (i) they
will provide the Company with all information concerning Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary and their affiliates necessary or appropriate to be
included in the Proxy Statement, (ii) at the Special Meeting or any
postponement or adjournment thereof (or at any other meeting at which the
Merger or this Agreement are considered by stockholders), they will vote, or
cause to be voted, all of the shares of Company Common Stock then owned by
them, or any of their Subsidiaries and affiliates, if any, in favor of
adoption of this Agreement and approval of the Merger and (iii) use their
commercially reasonable best efforts, after consultation with the other
parties hereto to respond promptly to all such comments of and requests by
the SEC. As promptly as practicable after the Proxy Statement has been
cleared by the SEC, the Company shall mail the Proxy Statement to the
stockholders of the Company.   SECTION 6.7 Directors\' and Officers\'
Indemnification.   (a) The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain the provisions with respect to
indemnification set forth in Article VIII of the Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and Article IV of the Company\'s By-laws on the date of this
Agreement and shall provide for indemnification to the fullest extent
permitted by and in accordance with the DGCL, which provisions shall not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years after the
Effective Time (or, in the case of matters occurring prior to the Effective
Time which have not been resolved prior to the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, until such matters are finally resolved) in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were directors or officers of the Company in
respect of actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement).   (b) The
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify at all times after the Effective Time
each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof, an
employee, agent, director or officer of the Company or of any of the
Company\'s Subsidiaries (individually an "Indemnified Party" and collectively
the "Indemnified Parties"), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
law, with respect to any claim, liability, loss, damage, cost or expense,
whenever asserted or claimed ("Indemnified Liability"), based in whole or in
part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, any matter existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. Parent shall indemnify the
Indemnified Parties against Indemnified Liabilities, and such indemnification
shall not be limited by the DGCL; provided that such indemnification shall
not be applicable to any claims made against the Indemnified Parties if a
judgment or other final adjudication established that their acts or omissions
were (A) committed in bad faith or were the result of active and deliberate
dishonesty and were material to the cause of action so deliberated or (B)
arising out of, based upon or attributable to the gaining in fact of any
undisclosed personal financial profit or other undisclosed personal advantage
to which they were not legally entitled. Without limiting the foregoing, in
the event any Indemnified Party becomes involved in any capacity in any
action, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on, or arising
in whole or in part out of, any matter, including the
transactions contemplated hereby, existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, then to the extent permitted by law, Parent shall, or Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, periodically advance to
such Indemnified Party its legal and other expenses (including the cost of
any investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject
to the provision by such Indemnified Party of an undertaking to reimburse
the amounts so advanced in the event of a final determination by a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled
thereto. Promptly after receipt by an Indemnified Party of notice of the
assertion (an "Assertion") of any claim or the commencement of any action
against him in respect to which indemnity or reimbursement may be sought
against Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or a subsidiary of
the Company or the Surviving Corporation ("Indemnitors") hereunder,
such Indemnified Party shall notify any Indemnitor in writing of the
Assertion, but the failure to so notify any Indemnitor shall not relieve
any Indemnitor of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Party
hereunder except to the extent that such failure shall have materially
and irreversibly prejudiced Indemnitor in defending against such
Assertion. Indemnitors shall be entitled to participate in and, to the
extent Indemnitors elect by written notice to such Indemnified Party within
30 days after receipt by any Indemnitor of notice of such Assertion, to
assume the defense of such Assertion, at their own expense, with counsel
chosen by Indemnitors and reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified
Party. Notwithstanding that Indemnitors shall have elected by such written
notice to assume the defense of any Assertion, such Indemnified Party shall
have the right to participate in the investigation and defense thereof,
with separate counsel chosen by such Indemnified Party, but in such event
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be paid by such Indemnified
Party unless such separate counsel is required due to a conflict of interest,
in which case the Indemnitors shall be responsible for the fees and
expenses of one separate counsel. No Indemnified Party shall settle any
Assertion without the prior written consent of Parent, nor shall any
Indemnitor settle any Assertion without either (i) the written consent of
all Indemnified Parties against whom such Assertion was made, or (ii)
obtaining an unconditional general release from the party making the
Assertion for all Indemnified Parties as a condition of such settlement. The
provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the respective Indemnified Parties.   ARTICLE VII  
CONDITIONS   SECTION 7.1 Conditions to Each Party\'s Obligation to Effect
the Merger. The respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger
shall be subject to the satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date of each
of the following conditions:   (a) This Agreement shall have been adopted
by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock, if such vote is required by applicable
law.   (b) Acquisition Subsidiary shall have accepted for payment and
paid for all shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer in
accordance with the terms hereof (and, if applicable, shall have purchased
the shares of Company Common Stock held by the Trust pursuant to Section 23
of the Stockholder Agreement); provided, that this condition may not be
asserted by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary if Acquisition Subsidiary fails
to accept for payment or pay for shares of Company Common Stock tendered
in the Offer in violation of the terms of the Offer.   (c) No statute,
rule, order, decree or regulation shall have been enacted or promulgated and
no other action shall have been taken by any Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction which enjoins or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the
Merger or makes the Merger illegal.   SECTION 7.2 Frustration of Closing
Conditions. Neither Parent nor Acquisition Subsidiary may rely on the failure
of any condition set forth in Annex A if such failure was caused by such
party\'s failure to fulfill in any material respects its obligations under
this Agreement.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION   SECTION 8.1 Termination.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement may be
terminated and the Offer and the Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to
the Effective Time, whether before or after stockholder adoption of this
Agreement, except for a termination pursuant to clause (d) or clause (e)
below which cannot be effectuated after the acceptance for payment of shares
of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer (provided that such shares are
paid for promptly following acceptance for payment) and, if applicable, the
purchase of the shares of Company Common Stock held by the Trust pursuant to
Section 23 of the Stockholder Agreement:   (a) By the mutual consent of
Parent and the Company, but, following the acceptance for payment of shares
of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, consent of the Company may
only be given with the approval of a majority of the Continuing Directors in
accordance with Section 1.3(b).   (b) By the Company if the Offer shall not
have been commenced within ten Business Days after the date hereof.   (c)
By either the Company or Parent if:   (i) the Offer shall not have been
consummated on or prior to  March 15, 2001 (the "Termination Date"), provided
that Parent or  Acquisition Subsidiary may not terminate pursuant to this
Section  8.1(c) if Acquisition Subsidiary fails to accept for payment or
pay  for shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer in  violation
of the terms of the Offer;   (ii) any Governmental Entity shall have issued
a statute,  order, decree or regulation or taken any other action (which 
statute, order, decree, regulation or other action the parties  hereto shall
have used their commercially reasonable best efforts  to lift), in each case
permanently enjoining or otherwise  prohibiting consummation of the Offer or
the Merger or making the  Offer or the Merger illegal and such statute,
order, decree,  regulation or other action shall have become final and  non-
appealable; or   (iii) prior to the acceptance for payment of shares of 
Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, if the other party is  in
material breach of its representations or warranties or fails to  perform in
any material respect its covenants or other agreements  hereunder to the
extent required to have been performed at such  time, which breach or failure
to perform is incapable of being  cured by the party so breaching or failing
to perform prior to the  Termination Date or, if capable of being cured by
such date, has  not been cured within 30 days after the terminating party
gives  written notice of such breach to the other party; or   (iv) the
Stockholder Agreement is terminated pursuant to  Section 5(b) or Section 5(c)
thereof provided that if the  Stockholder Agreement terminates pursuant to
Section 5(b)(i) or  5(b)(iii) thereof, the Company may not effect such
termination  unless contemporaneously therewith the Company pays or causes to
be  paid to Parent, or its designee, in immediately available funds the 
Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.1.   (d) By the
Company if, prior to acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock
tendered in the Offer, (i) the Board authorizes the Company, subject to
complying with the terms of this Agreement, to enter into a binding written
agreement with respect to a transaction that constitutes a Superior Proposal
and the Company has notified Parent in writing that it intends to enter into
such an agreement and terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (d),
attaching the most current version of such agreement to such notice, and (ii)
during the five Business Day period after the Company\'s notice, the Company
shall have negotiated with Parent regarding the terms and conditions of a
revised proposal by Parent and if the Board shall have concluded, after
considering any revised proposal made by Parent during such period that the
Superior Proposal giving rise to the Company\'s notice, as then revised,
continues to be a Superior Proposal. The Company may not effect such
termination sooner than the second Business Day after Parent receives the
Company\'s notice, and unless contemporaneously therewith the Company pays or
causes to be paid to Parent, or its designee, in immediately available funds
the Termination Fee required to be paid pursuant to Section 9.1. The Company
agrees to notify Parent promptly if the Board determines not to enter into a
binding agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal as to which
notification was given.   (e) By Parent, prior to the acceptance for
payment of shares of Company Common Stock tendered in the Offer, if (i) the
Company enters into a written agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal

party specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is
made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void after the
expiration of any applicable period following such notice. In the event of
such termination, there shall be no liability on the part of Parent,
Acquisition Subsidiary or the Company except as set forth in Section 9.1

MISCELLANEOUS   SECTION 9.1 Fees and Expenses. Whether or not the Offer and
the Merger are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid
by the party incurring such costs or expenses, except as set forth below.  
(a) In the event that   (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company
pursuant to  Section 8.1(d), or by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(iv)  due to the Stockholder Agreement being terminated pursuant to 
Section 5(b)(i) or 5(b)(iii) thereof, or   (ii) this Agreement is terminated

8.1(c)(iv) due to  the Stockholder Agreement being terminated pursuant to
Section  5(b)(i) , 5(b)(iii) or 5(c)(ii) thereof;   then in each such case
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent or its designee a fee
(the "Termination Fee") of $44,000,000. Acceptance of payment of the
Termination Fee by Parent shall constitute conclusive evidence that this
Agreement has been validly terminated, and upon such payment, each of the
Company, Acquisition Subsidiary and Parent shall be fully released and
discharged from any liability under this Agreement.   (b) In the event
that   (i) this Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent  pursuant

such termination, there was pending a  bona fide Acquisition Proposal other
than the transactions  contemplated hereby and prior to the first anniversary
of such  termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement for, or 
consummates, an Acquisition Proposal and the consideration per  share to be
paid to the holders of the capital stock of the Company  pursuant to such
Acquisition Proposal is of equal or greater value  than the consideration to
be paid to such holders under this  Agreement,  then in such case, the
Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent or its designee.   (c) The
Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent or its designee concurrently
with or prior to a termination referred to in clause 9.1(a)(i) above. The
Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent or its designee within 24
hours after a termination referred to in clause 9.1(a)(ii) above. The Company
shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent or its designee promptly (and in any
event within two Business Days) after the first to occur of the execution of
an agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal, in either case, in respect of
which such payment is required pursuant to Section 9.1(b) above.   (d) Upon
a termination of this Agreement by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(iv) due to the Stockholder Agreement being terminated pursuant to
Section 5(b)(ii) or 5(c)(i) thereof, the Company shall reimburse Parent and
Acquisition Subsidiary for their reasonable out-of-pocket expenses not in
excess of $1,000,000 in the aggregate. Such payment shall be made within two
business days following the later of such termination or Parent or
Acquisition Subsidiary providing reasonable documentation substantiating such
expenses.   SECTION 9.2 Amendment; Waiver.   (a) This Agreement may be
amended by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their

such stockholders if such amendment alters or changes (i) the Merger
Consideration, (ii) any term of the certificate of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation or (iii) any terms or conditions of this Agreement if
such alteration or change would adversely affect the holders of any shares of
capital stock of the Company other than Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary.

writing signed on behalf of such party.   SECTION 9.3 Survival. The
respective representations and warranties of Parent, Acquisition Subsidiary
and the Company contained herein or in any certificates or other documents
delivered prior to or as of the Effective Time shall not survive beyond the

correct, except that this clause (ii) of this condition shall  be deemed
satisfied (and not to constitute an unsatisfied condition  to Acquisition
Subsidiary\'s obligation to accept for payment and  pay for shares of Company
Common Stock in the Offer) so long as any  failures of such representations
and warranties to be true and  correct do not individually or in the
aggregate have a Material  Adverse Effect, in each of clauses (i) and (ii) as
of the date of  the Agreement and as of the Expiration Date as though made on
and  as of the Expiration Date (except to the extent such  representations
and warranties are made as of a specific date);   (b) the Company shall not
have performed in all material  respects all material obligations required to

application of the Trustees of the Trust (i) approving the  Trust\'s
execution, delivery and performance of the Stockholder  Agreement and the

and the transactions contemplated thereby and the execution,  delivery and

all  liabilities relating to or arising from the execution, delivery and

portion of the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' businesses  and assets taken
as a whole, (2) prohibit or make illegal the  acceptance for payment, payment
for or purchase of shares of  Company Common Stock or the consummation of the
Offer or the Merger  by Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary, or (3) impose
material  limitations on the ability of Parent or Acquisition Subsidiary 
effectively to exercise full rights of ownership of the shares of  Company
Common Stock purchased by them, including the right to vote  such shares of
Company Common Stock on all matters properly  presented to the Company\'s

tendered in the Offer.   As used in this Annex A, "Applicable Governmental
Entity" shall mean a federal or state United States Governmental Entity, a
