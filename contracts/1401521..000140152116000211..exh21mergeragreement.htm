SECTION 2.01. Effect on Capital Stock. At the First Effective Time, by virtue
of the First Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Merger Sub:



4 

(a) Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Merger Sub shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent,
Merger Sub or any of their respective wholly-owned subsidiaries shall no
longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired and
shall cease to exist, and no Parent Common Stock or other consideration shall
be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.

(c) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and Section 2.01(d), at the First Effective
Time each issued and outstanding share (other than shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.01(b)) of Company Common Stock shall automatically
be converted into and shall thereafter represent a number of validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the Per
Share Stock Consideration (subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2.01(d), the "Exchange Ratio").

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, from the
date of this Agreement until the First Effective Time, the outstanding shares
of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock or the securities convertible
into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class
by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock
split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or
readjustment, or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date
within said period, the Exchange Ratio, the Per Share Stock Consideration and
the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide the Sole Stockholder the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

(e) The shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued upon the conversion of
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(c) are referred to
collectively as "Merger Consideration". As of the First Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each
holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, in accordance with Section 2.02, the Merger
Consideration upon surrender of such Certificate.

SECTION 2.02. Exchange of Certificates.

(a) At the First Effective Time, Parent (on behalf of Merger Sub) shall issue
to the Sole Stockholder the shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in
non-certificated book entry form unless a physical certificate is requested)
issuable pursuant to Section 2.01 in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock.

(b) The Merger Consideration issued in accordance with the terms of this
Article II upon conversion of any shares of Company Common Stock shall be
deemed to have



5 

been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of
Company Common Stock. After the First Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the First Effective Time. If, after the First Effective
Time, any certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock
are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

(c) Parent (on behalf of Merger Sub) shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration otherwise payable in respect of the Transactions such
amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or under any provision of state,
federal, provincial, territorial, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority,
such amounts shall be treated as paid to the Persons otherwise entitled to
such amounts. If the amount withheld and paid over is in respect of
consideration other than cash, the Surviving Corporation or other payor will
be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of the type of
consideration otherwise payable to the Person entitled to such amount, sold
such consideration on behalf of such Person for an amount of cash equal to the
fair market value of such consideration at the time of such deemed sale and
paid such cash proceeds to the appropriate taxing authority.

Except as disclosed in the disclosure letter delivered by the Company to
Parent immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement (the "Company

III and Article IV, and the disclosure of any item in any section or

of organization. Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is duly
qualified and in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which
the conduct or nature of its business or the ownership, leasing or holding of

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(b) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of the
articles of incorporation of the Company, as amended to the date of this

its treasury. All of the outstanding equity securities and other securities of
each Company Subsidiary are owned of record and beneficially by the Company or
one or more Company Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens. Except as set

other voting securities of the Company were issued, reserved for issuance or

outstanding shares of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary are, and all
such shares that may be issued prior to the First Effective Time will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right
under any provision of Law (including the NCBCA), the Company Charter, the
Company Byâ€‘laws, the certificate or articles of incorporation or by-laws (or
comparable charter and organizational documents) of any Company Subsidiary or
any contract, lease, license, indenture, bond, note, mortgage, guarantee,
agreement, instrument, obligation, understanding, permit, franchise,
commitment or other legally binding arrangement, whether written or oral

otherwise bound. There are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other
Indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiary having the right to vote
(or convertible into, or exchangeable or exercisable for, securities having
the right to vote) on any matters on which the Sole Stockholder or the holders
of common stock of any Company Subsidiary may vote ("Voting Company Debt").
Except as set forth above, there are not any options, warrants, calls, rights,
convertible or exchangeable securities, "phantom" stock rights, stock
appreciation rights, stock-based performance units, commitments, Contracts,
arrangements or undertakings of any kind to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which any of them is bound (A) obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, additional shares of capital stock or other equity
interests in, or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for any capital stock of or other equity interest in, the Company or of any

the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(b) Section 3.02(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth the persons
who will own beneficially and of record the shares of Parent Common Stock
issued in the First Merger and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to
be owned by such persons immediately following the First Merger and

Common Stock.

(c) Section 3.02(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a true and
complete list of all capital stock, membership interests, partnership

indirectly, by the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.03. Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability; State
Takeover Statutes.

(a) The Company has full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and the Company Ancillary Agreements to which it is a party, to
perform and comply with each of its obligations under this Agreement and such
Company Ancillary Agreements and to consummate the Transactions. The execution
and delivery by the Company hereof and thereof, the performance and compliance
by the Company with each of its obligations herein and therein and the
consummation by the Company of the Transactions have been duly authorized by
all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the
case of the First Merger, to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and the Signing Date
Company Ancillary Agreements and, (i) assuming the due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC of this Agreement,
this Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms and (ii) assuming
the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent of such Signing Date
Company Ancillary Agreements to which Parent is a party, such Signing Date
Company Ancillary Agreements constitute legal, valid and binding obligations
of the Company, enforceable against it in accordance with their respective
terms, except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) as limited by Laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally, by general equitable
principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before which any
Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought.

(b) The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Company Board"), at a meeting
duly called and held, duly and unanimously adopted resolutions (i) approving

force and effect and have not been modified, rescinded, amended or withdrawn.
The Company is not subject to the prohibitions on certain business
combinations set forth in Article 9 or Article 9A of the NCBCA. Assuming that
the representations and warranties of Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC
contained in Section 5.02(c) are true and correct, no other "business
combination," "control share acquisition," "fair price," "moratorium" or other
antitakeover Laws (collectively, "Takeover Laws") apply or purport to apply to
this Agreement or any other Transaction.

(c) The only vote of holders of any class or series of capital stock of the
Company or of any other securities of the Company Parties necessary to approve
this Agreement, the Company Ancillary Agreements, the Mergers and the other
Transactions is the approval of this Agreement by the Sole Stockholder. The
affirmative vote of the holders of any other securities of the Company Parties
is not necessary to consummate any Transaction other than the First Merger.

the execution and delivery by the Company of the Company Ancillary Agreements
to which it is a party and the consummation of the Mergers and the other
Transactions and compliance with and performance of the terms hereof and
thereof will not result in any violation of or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of consent or any
right of termination, cancellation, acceleration or material modification of

properties or assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary under, any
provision of (i) the Company Charter, the Company Byâ€‘laws or the comparable

Subsidiary or their respective properties or assets, other than, in the case
of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, any such items that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or materially impair the ability of the Company
Parties to perform their respective obligations hereunder or prevent or
unreasonably delay the consummation of any of the Transactions.

(b) No consent, approval, waiver, license, permit, franchise, authorization or
Judgment ("Consent") of, or registration, declaration, notice, report,
submission or other filing ("Filing") with, any Governmental Entity is
required to be obtained or made by or with respect to the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery of this



9 

Agreement or any of the Company Ancillary Agreements, the performance hereof
or thereof or the consummation of the Transactions or the ownership by Parent

SECTION 3.18. Insurance Matters.

(a) Section 3.18(a)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of each of the Company Subsidiaries which, by virtue of its
operations and activities, is required to be licensed as an insurance company
or reinsurance company (collectively, the "Company Insurance Subsidiaries"),
together with the jurisdiction of domicile thereof and each jurisdiction in
which each such Insurance Subsidiary is licensed to conduct the business of
insurance or reinsurance. Except as set forth in Section 3.18(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, none of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries is
"commercially domiciled" (as such term is used in such jurisdiction's
insurance holding company statutes) in any other jurisdiction or is otherwise
treated as domiciled under applicable Insurance Laws in a jurisdiction other
than its jurisdiction of domicile set forth in its articles of incorporation
or applicable organizational documents. Without limiting the generality of
Section 3.12, each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries and each of the
Company Insurance Producers is licensed or authorized, to the extent required
by Insurance Law, in each jurisdiction where it engages in business and where
applicable, for each line of business written, marketed, sold or administered
therein, except where the failure to be so licensed or authorized would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, all benefits due and payable under an
insurance contract issued by or on behalf of any of the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries have been paid in accordance with the terms of such insurance
contract, except for such benefits for which a Company Insurance Subsidiary in
its reasonable good faith discretion believes there is a basis to contest
payment.

(c) As of the date hereof, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect,
there are no unpaid claims or assessments made against any Company Insurance
Subsidiary, whether or not



17 

due, by any insurance guaranty association (in connection with that
association's fund relating to insolvent insurers), risk sharing plan, joint
underwriting association, residual market facility, assigned risk pool or
similar arrangement, in each case that are not reflected in the Company
Financial Statements.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 3.18(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Company Material Adverse Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates
and other agreements of insurance in effect as of the date hereof (including
all applications, endorsements, supplements, riders and ancillary agreements
in connection therewith) issued by any Company Insurance Subsidiary, and any
and all marketing materials, agent agreements, broker agreements, service
contracts, and managing general agent agreements to which the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries is a party, are, to the extent required under
applicable Laws, on forms approved by the applicable Insurance Regulators or
have been filed with and not objected to by such Insurance Regulators within
the period provided for objection, and all of such forms comply with the
Insurance Laws except for such failures to comply with Law that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. As to premium rates established by any Company
Insurance Subsidiary, which are required to be filed with or approved by any
Insurance Regulators, the rates have been so filed or approved, the premiums
charged conform thereto, and such premiums comply with the Insurance Laws
except for such failures to comply that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(e) Since January 1, 2013, each of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries and each
of the Company Insurance Producers has duly and timely filed all reports or
other filings required to be filed with any Insurance Regulator in the manner
prescribed therefor under applicable Insurance Laws, and no Insurance
Regulator has asserted in writing to the Company or any Company Insurance
Subsidiary any material deficiency or violation with respect thereto, except
as has been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of such Insurance Regulator,
or except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the transactions between or among Company Insurance
Subsidiaries and their affiliates, and all Contracts and transactions in
effect between any Company Insurance Subsidiary and any affiliate that are
required to be filed with, and approved or non-disapproved by, an Insurance
Regulator under the applicable insurance holding company statutes or other
applicable Insurance Laws, have been filed with such applicable Insurance
Regulator, and the applicable Company Insurance Subsidiary has obtained any
required approvals or deemed approvals of Insurance Regulators with respect
thereto, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is subject to any
cease-and-desist or other order issued by, or is a party to any written
agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or is a
party to any commitment letter or similar written undertaking to, or is
subject to any order or directive by, or is a recipient of any supervisory
letter from, or has adopted any board resolutions at the request of any
Governmental



18 

Entity (each, a "Regulatory Agreement"), that materially restricts the conduct
of its business or that in any other manner relates to its capital adequacy or
its underwriting policies, nor has the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries been advised in writing by any Governmental Entity that it is
considering issuing or requesting any Regulatory Agreement.

(g) From January 1, 2013 through the date hereof, the Company has not received
written notice from any reinsurer party to a Company Reinsurance Agreement of
any anticipated default under the terms of the applicable Company Reinsurance
Agreement that would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section
3.18(g) of the Company Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof there are no
disputes under any Company Reinsurance Agreement except for such disputes that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Insurance Subsidiaries are
entitled under SAP to take full credit in their Company Statutory Financial
Statements for all amounts reflected therein that are recoverable by them
under any Company Reinsurance Agreements pursuant to which they are cedants.

(h) Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered or made available to
Parent a true and complete copy of any material actuarial reports in the
Company's possession and prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise, with
respect to any Company Insurance Subsidiary for all periods beginning on or
after January 1, 2013 through the date hereof, and all material attachments,
addenda, supplements and modifications thereto to the extent in the Company's
possession (the "Company Actuarial Analyses"). The information and data
furnished by the Company or any Company Subsidiary to their independent
actuaries in connection with the preparation of the Company Actuarial Analyses
were accurate in all material respects for the periods covered in such
reports. The aggregate insurance policy reserves for claims, losses (including
incurred but not reported losses), loss adjustment expenses (whether allocated
or unallocated), and unearned premium for each Company Insurance Subsidiary,
as reflected in the Company Statutory Financial Statements (collectively, the
"Company Insurance Reserves"), (i) were determined in all material respects in
accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards (except as otherwise
noted in the Company Statutory Financial Statements and notes thereto included
in such Company Statutory Financial Statements); (ii) were computed on the
basis of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in
computing the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as
otherwise noted in the Company Statutory Financial Statements and notes
thereto included in such Company Statutory Financial Statements) and (iii)
satisfied the requirements of Insurance Law in all material respects.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else contained in this Agreement,
the Company and its representatives are not making any representation or
warranty in this Agreement in respect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the
Company Insurance Reserves of the Company or the Company Insurance
Subsidiaries or of the collectability of reinsurance.

(i) The Company has provided Parent with a complete list of all bonds,
structured securities, stocks and other investments that were carried on the
books and records of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as of April 30,
2016 (such bonds, structured securities, stocks and other investments,
together with all bonds, structured securities, stocks and



19 

other investments acquired by the Company and the Company Subsidiaries between
such date and the date hereof, the "Company Investment Assets"). Except for
Company Investment Assets sold in the Ordinary Course of Business, in
compliance with the Company Investment Guidelines or as permitted or otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, as applicable, has good and marketable title to all of the
material Company Investment Assets it purports to own, free and clear of all
Liens other than Permitted Liens. The Company has made available to Parent
prior to the execution of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the
investment guidelines of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in place as
of the date hereof with respect to the investment of the Investment Assets
(the "Company Investment Guidelines"). To the Knowledge of the Company, the
composition of the Company Investment Assets complies in all material respects
with applicable Law and the Company Investment Guidelines.

(j) The Company has made available to Parent true and complete copies of all
written analyses and reports submitted by any Company Insurance Subsidiary to
any Insurance Regulator during the past thirty-six (36) months relating to
risk-based capital calculations and Insurance Regulatory Information System
ratios as determined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
and no Insurance Regulator has asserted to the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries in writing any deficiency or violation with respect thereto,
except as has been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of such Insurance
Regulator, or except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, neither the Company nor any of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries
has been notified by any Company Specified Producer or Insurance Regulator in
writing of any material non-compliance by any Company Specified Producer with
applicable Insurance Laws (including laws, regulations, directives and
opinions of Insurance Regulators relating to the soliciting, marketing,
administering, negotiating sale or production of the Company's and the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries' products) in connection with the distribution of
insurance policies or contracts issued by a Company Insurance Subsidiary.

(k) To the Knowledge of the Company, each insurance agent, general agent,
agency, producer, broker, reinsurance intermediary, program manager, managing
general agent, third party administrator, marketer, wholesaler and managing
general underwriter that wrote, sold, produced or managed a material amount of
insurance business since January 1, 2014 for one or more of the Company
Insurance Subsidiaries (each, a "Company Producer") was, to the extent
required by applicable Law, duly licensed for the type of activity and
business conducted or written, sold, produced, underwritten or managed for or
on behalf of the Company Insurance Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the
Company, since January 1, 2014, no Company Producer has materially violated or
is currently in violation in any material respect of any term or provision of
any Law applicable to the writing, sale, production or underwriting of
business for the Company Insurance Subsidiaries, except for such failures or
such violations that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

(l) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Producer was
appointed



20 

and compensated by the Company or the Company Subsidiaries in compliance in
all respects with applicable Insurance Law. None of the Company or any of the
Company Insurance Subsidiaries has received written notice of any material
disputes with any current or former Company Producer concerning commissions,
except for such disputes that (i) have been settled or otherwise fully
resolved, or (ii) if resolved fully in the Company Producer's favor, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no Company Producer
accounting individually for 10% or more of the total gross premiums of all of
the Company Insurance Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2015, has
indicated to the Company or the Company Insurance Subsidiaries in writing or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, orally that such Company Producer will be
unable or unwilling to continue its relationship as a Company Producer with
any Company Insurance Subsidiary.

SECTION 3.19. Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans and Agreements. Since
December 31, 2015 through the date hereof, there has not been (i) any adoption
or amendment by the Company or any Company Subsidiary of any bonus, pension,
profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation, stock
ownership, stock purchase, equity or equity-based incentive, phantom stock,
retirement, directors' compensation, holiday pay, vacation, severance, sick
leave, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical, fringe benefit,
insurance or other plan, arrangement or understanding (whether or not legally
binding), in each case established or maintained by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or as to which the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates
has contributed or otherwise may have any liability (collectively, "Company
Benefit Plans") or (ii) any entering into or amendment of any employment,
incentive compensation, retention, consulting, indemnification, severance or
termination, or other similar Contract between the Company or any Company
Subsidiary and any current or former employee, executive officer, director or
consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Company Benefit Agreements"). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
maintains or has any obligation or liability under any general severance plan
or policy.

SECTION 3.20. ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments.

(a) Section 3.20(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a list of all
Company Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements, including any "employee
pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974 ("ERISA")) ("Company Pension Plans") and "employee
welfare benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA). Each Company
Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement has been administered in material
compliance with its terms and with the requirements of Law, including ERISA
and the Code. No action, claim or Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened with respect to any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. All contributions required
to be made to each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement have
been timely made and all obligations in respect of each Company Benefit Plan
and Company Benefit Agreement have been properly



21 

accrued and reflected on the Company's financial statements that would not
result in a material liability to the Company. The Company has made available
to Parent true, complete and correct copies of (i) each Company Benefit Plan
and Company Benefit Agreement and all amendments thereto (or, in the case of
any unwritten Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, a description
thereof), (ii) with respect to each Company Benefit Plan, to the extent
applicable, for the two most recent plan years (A) the annual report on Form
5500 and attached schedules, (B) audited financial statements of such Company

Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code, (v) any request for a determination currently pending before the IRS,

Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or other Governmental Entity relating to
any outstanding controversy or audit relating to a Company Benefit Plan or

group annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan.

(b) All Company Pension Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code are so qualified and have been the subject of determination
or opinion letters from the IRS to the effect that such Company Pension Plans
are so qualified and all related trusts that are intended to be exempt from
federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code have been the subject of
determination or opinion letters from the IRS to the effect that such trusts
are so exempt, and no such determination or opinion letter has been revoked
nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, has revocation been threatened or any
fact or event occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the qualified status of any such Company Pension Plan or the exempt status of
any such trust, nor has any such Company Pension Plan been amended since the
date of its most recent determination or opinion letter or application
therefor in any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or
materially increase its costs. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary
has any liability or obligation under any Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement to provide benefits after termination of employment to any
current or former employee (including retirees) or dependent other than as
required by Section 4980B of the Code. None of the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has any liability for a
failure to comply with Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B of

302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA. None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary
or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates currently maintains, contributes
to or has any liability under or, at any time during the past six (6) years
has maintained or contributed to, any multiemployer plan (as defined in
Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA) or multiple employer plan (as described in
Section 413 of the Code). None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, any
officer of the Company, or any Company Subsidiary, any of the Company Benefit
Plans which are subject to ERISA, including the Company Pension



22 

Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any trustee or administrator thereof,
has engaged in a "prohibited transaction" (as such term is defined in Section
406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or any other breach of fiduciary
responsibility. No Company Benefit Plan is or has been funded by, associated
with or related to a voluntary employees' beneficiary association (within the
meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code). No Company Benefit Plan holds the
stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a plan asset.

(d) Neither AmRisc nor any other Person that is not a Company Subsidiary is an
ERISA Affiliate with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(e) No Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement is subject to or
governed by the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States.

individual with respect to any income tax, additional tax or interest charge
imposed pursuant to Section 409A of the Code.

(g) With respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, (i) no such Company Benefit Plan is unfunded or funded through a
"welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code) and (ii) each such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan"
(as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) complies with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

(h) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the Mergers and any other Transactions by
any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of its Affiliates who
is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in U.S. Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1), either alone or together with any other event,
would be characterized as a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of
the Code). Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any obligation
to provide any gross-up payment to any individual with respect to any income
tax, additional tax or interest charge imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code.

(i) The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement
do not, and the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not (i) entitle any
employee, officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any
severance, transaction bonus, retention or other payment, (ii) accelerate the

respect to any period ending before the Closing Date) and provide insurance in
such amounts and against such risks as are reasonable in accordance with
industry practices or as is required by Law. Neither Parent nor any of the
Parent Subsidiaries is in material breach or default, and neither Parent nor
any of the Parent Subsidiaries has taken any action or failed to take any
action which, with notice or the lapse of time or both, would constitute such
a breach or default, or permit termination or modification, of any of the
Parent Insurance Policies. Since January 1, 2015, no notice of cancellation or
termination has been received by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary with respect
to any Parent Insurance Policy, nor will any such cancellation or termination
result from the consummation of the Transactions. Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries have given notice to each such insurer of all material claims
that have arisen since January 1, 2015 and may be insured thereby.

1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law), or as
a transferee or successor.

SECTION 5.15. Tax Treatment. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has
taken any action or failed to take any action or knows of any fact, agreement,
plan or other circumstance, in each case that would, to the Knowledge of
Parent, jeopardize the qualification of the Mergers, taken together, as a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, if they
would otherwise so qualify.

SECTION 5.16. Proceedings. Except for Proceedings of the type described in the
second sentence of this Section 5.16 (irrespective of whether any such action,
claim or Proceeding existed prior to or after the date hereof), there is no
action, claim or Proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened

have been since January 1, 2013 in compliance in all respects with all Laws
and all Judgments applicable to Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any assets

individually or in the aggregate, has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any

material respect with any Law that remains unresolved.

SECTION 5.18. Insurance Matters.

(a) Section 5.18(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter contains a true and
complete list of each of the Parent Subsidiaries which, by virtue of its
operations and activities, is required to be licensed as an insurance company
or reinsurance company (collectively, the "Parent Insurance Subsidiaries"),
together with the jurisdiction of domicile thereof and each



42 

jurisdiction in which each such Insurance Subsidiary is licensed to conduct
the business of insurance or reinsurance. Except as set forth in Section
5.18(a) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, none of the Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries is "commercially domiciled" (as such term is used in such
jurisdiction's insurance holding company statutes) in any other jurisdiction
or is otherwise treated as domiciled under applicable Insurance Laws in a
jurisdiction other than its jurisdiction of domicile set forth in its articles
of incorporation or applicable organizational documents. Without limiting the
generality of Section 5.12, each of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries and each
of the Parent Insurance Producers is licensed or authorized, to the extent
required by Insurance Law, in each jurisdiction where it engages in business
and where applicable, for each line of business written, marketed, sold or
administered therein, except where the failure to be so licensed or authorized
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Except as set forth in Section 5.18(b) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all benefits due and payable under an
insurance contract issued by or on behalf of any of the Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries have been paid in accordance with the terms of such insurance
contract, except for such benefits for which a Parent Insurance Subsidiary in
its reasonable good faith discretion believes there is a basis to contest
payment.

(c) As of the date hereof, except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
there are no unpaid claims or assessments made against any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary, whether or not due, by any insurance guaranty association (in
connection with that association's fund relating to insolvent insurers), risk
sharing plan, joint underwriting association, residual market facility,
assigned risk pool or similar arrangement, in each case that are not reflected
in the Parent Financial Statements.

(d) Except as set forth in Section 5.18(d) of the Parent Disclosure Letter or
as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have
a Parent Material Adverse Effect, all policies, binders, slips, certificates
and other agreements of insurance in effect as of the date hereof (including
all applications, endorsements, supplements, riders and ancillary agreements
in connection therewith) issued by any Parent Insurance Subsidiary, and any
and all marketing materials, agent agreements, broker agreements, service
contracts, and managing general agent agreements to which the Parent or any of
the Parent Subsidiaries is a party, are, to the extent required under
applicable Laws, on forms approved by the applicable Insurance Regulators or
have been filed with and not objected to by such Insurance Regulators within
the period provided for objection, and all of such forms comply with the
Insurance Laws except for such failures to comply with Law that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As to premium rates established by any Parent
Insurance Subsidiary, which are required to be filed with or approved by any
Insurance Regulators, the rates have been so filed or approved, the premiums
charged conform thereto, and such premiums comply with the Insurance Laws
except for such failures to comply that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.



43 

(e) Since January 1, 2013, each of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries and each
of the Parent Insurance Producers has duly and timely filed all reports or
other filings required to be filed with any Insurance Regulator in the manner
prescribed therefor under applicable Insurance Laws, and no Insurance
Regulator has asserted in writing to the Parent or any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary any material deficiency or violation with respect thereto, except
as has been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of such Insurance Regulator,
or except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Without limiting the
foregoing, each of the transactions between or among Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries and their affiliates, and all Contracts and transactions in
effect between any Parent Insurance Subsidiary and any affiliate that are
required to be filed with, and approved or non-disapproved by, an Insurance
Regulator under the applicable insurance holding company statutes or other
applicable Insurance Laws, have been filed with such applicable Insurance
Regulator, and the applicable Parent Insurance Subsidiary has obtained any
required approvals or deemed approvals of Insurance Regulators with respect
thereto, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(f) Neither Parent nor any of Parent Subsidiaries is subject to any Regulatory
Agreement, that materially restricts the conduct of its business or that in
any other manner relates to its capital adequacy or its underwriting policies,
nor has Parent or any of Parent Subsidiaries been advised in writing by any
Governmental Entity that it is considering issuing or requesting any
Regulatory Agreement.

(g) From January 1, 2013 through the date hereof, Parent has not received
written notice from any reinsurer party to a Parent Reinsurance Agreement of
any anticipated default under the terms of the applicable Parent Reinsurance
Agreement that would, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely
to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth in Section
5.18(g) of the Parent Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof there are no
disputes under any Parent Reinsurance Agreement except for such disputes that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Insurance Subsidiaries are entitled
under SAP to take full credit in their Parent Statutory Financial Statements
for all amounts reflected therein that are recoverable by them under any
Parent Reinsurance Agreements pursuant to which they are cedants.

(h) Prior to the date hereof, Parent has delivered or made available to the
Company a true and complete copy of any material actuarial reports in Parent's
possession and prepared by actuaries, independent or otherwise, with respect
to any Parent Insurance Subsidiary for all periods beginning on or after
January 1, 2013 through the date hereof, and all material attachments,
addenda, supplements and modifications thereto to the extent in Parent's
possession (the "Parent Actuarial Analyses"). The information and data
furnished by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to their independent actuaries in
connection with the preparation of the Parent Actuarial Analyses were accurate
in all material respects for the periods covered in such reports. The
aggregate insurance policy reserves for claims, losses (including incurred but
not reported losses), loss adjustment expenses (whether allocated or
unallocated), and unearned premium for each Parent Insurance Subsidiary, as
reflected in the Parent Statutory Financial Statements (collectively, the
"Parent Insurance Reserves"), (i) were determined in all material respects in



44 

accordance with generally accepted actuarial standards (except as otherwise
noted in the Parent Statutory Financial Statements and notes thereto included
in such Parent Statutory Financial Statements); (ii) were computed on the
basis of methodologies consistent in all material respects with those used in
computing the corresponding reserves in the prior fiscal years (except as
otherwise noted in the Parent Statutory Financial Statements and notes thereto
included in such Parent Statutory Financial Statements) and (iii) satisfied
the requirements of Insurance Law in all material respects; Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything else contained in this Agreement, Parent and its
representatives are not making any representation or warranty in this
Agreement in respect of the adequacy or sufficiency of the Parent Insurance
Reserves of Parent or the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries or of the
collectability of reinsurance.

(i) Parent has provided the Company with a complete list of all bonds,
structured securities, stocks and other investments that were carried on the
books and records of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries as of April 30, 2016 (such
bonds, structured securities, stocks and other investments, together with all
bonds, structured securities, stocks and other investments acquired by Parent
and Parent Subsidiaries between such date and the date hereof, the "Parent
Investment Assets"). Except for Parent Investment Assets sold in the Ordinary
Course of Business, in compliance with the Parent Investment Guidelines or as
permitted or otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent and
Parent Subsidiaries, as applicable, has good and marketable title to all of
the material Parent Investment Assets it purports to own, free and clear of
all Liens other than Permitted Liens. Parent has made available to the Company
prior to the execution of this Agreement a true and complete copy of the
investment guidelines of Parent and Parent Subsidiaries in place as of the
date hereof with respect to the investment of the Investment Assets (the
"Parent Investment Guidelines"). To the Knowledge of Parent, the composition
of the Parent Investment Assets complies in all material respects with
applicable Law and the Parent Investment Guidelines.

(j) Parent has made available to the Company true and complete copies of all
written analyses and reports submitted by any Parent Insurance Subsidiary to
any Insurance Regulator during the past thirty-six (36) months relating to
risk-based capital calculations and Insurance Regulatory Information System
ratios as determined by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners,
and no Insurance Regulator has asserted to Parent or any of Parent
Subsidiaries in writing any deficiency or violation with respect thereto,
except as has been cured or resolved to the satisfaction of such Insurance
Regulator, or except as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. As of the
date hereof, neither Parent nor any of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries has
been notified by any Parent Specified Producer or Insurance Regulator in
writing of any material non-compliance by any Parent Specified Producer with
applicable Insurance Laws (including laws, regulations, directives and
opinions of Insurance Regulators relating to the soliciting, marketing,
administering, negotiating sale or production of Parent's and the Parent
Insurance Subsidiaries' products) in connection with the distribution of
insurance policies or contracts issued by a Parent Insurance Subsidiary.

(k) To the Knowledge of Parent, each insurance agent, general agent, agency,
producer, broker, reinsurance intermediary, program manager, managing general
agent, third



45 

party administrator, marketer, wholesaler and managing general underwriter
that wrote, sold, produced or managed a material amount of insurance business
since January 1, 2014 for one or more of the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries
(each, a "Parent Producer") was, to the extent required by applicable Law,
duly licensed for the type of activity and business conducted or written,
sold, produced, underwritten or managed for or on behalf of the Parent
Insurance Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of Parent, since January 1, 2014, no
Parent Producer has materially violated or is currently in violation in any
material respect of any term or provision of any Law applicable to the
writing, sale, production or underwriting of business for the Parent Insurance
Subsidiaries, except for such failures or such violations that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(l) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Producer was
appointed and compensated by Parent or Parent Subsidiaries in compliance in
all respects with applicable Insurance Law. None of Parent or any of the
Parent Insurance Subsidiaries has received written notice of any material
disputes with any current or former Parent Producer concerning commissions,
except for such disputes that (i) have been settled or otherwise fully
resolved, or (ii) if resolved fully in the Parent Producer's favor, would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. As of the date hereof, no Parent Producer accounting
individually for 10% or more of the total gross premiums of all of the Parent
Insurance Subsidiaries for the year ended December 31, 2015, has indicated to
Parent or the Parent Insurance Subsidiaries in writing or, to the Knowledge of
Parent, orally that such Parent Producer will be unable or unwilling to
continue its relationship as a Parent Producer with any Parent Insurance
Subsidiary.

SECTION 5.19. Absence of Changes in Benefit Plans and Agreements. Since
December 31, 2015 through the date hereof, there has not been (i) any adoption
or amendment in any material respect by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary of any
bonus, pension, profit sharing, deferred compensation, incentive compensation,
stock ownership, stock purchase, equity or equity-based incentive, phantom
stock, retirement, directors' compensation, holiday pay, vacation, severance,
sick leave, disability, death benefit, hospitalization, medical, fringe
benefit, insurance or other plan, arrangement or understanding (whether or not
legally binding), in each case established or maintained by Parent, any Parent
Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates or as to which Parent,
any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA Affiliates has
contributed or otherwise may have any liability (collectively, "Parent Benefit
Plans") or (ii) any entering into or amendment of any employment, incentive
compensation, retention, consulting, indemnification, severance or
termination, or other similar Contract between Parent or any Parent Subsidiary
and any current or former employee, executive officer, director or consultant
of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (collectively, the "Parent Benefit
Agreements"). Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary maintains or has any
obligation or liability under any general severance plan or policy.







46 

SECTION 5.20. ERISA Compliance; Excess Parachute Payments.

(a) Each Parent Benefit Plan and Parent Benefit Agreement has been
administered in material compliance with its terms and with the requirements
of Law, including ERISA and the Code. No action, claim or Proceeding is
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened, with respect to any Parent
Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement that would, individually or in the
aggregate, be reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All
contributions required to be made to each Parent Benefit Plan and Parent
Benefit Agreement have been timely made and all obligations in respect of each
Parent Benefit Plan and Parent Benefit Agreement have been properly accrued
and reflected on Parent's financial statements except that would not result in
material liability to Parent.

(b) All Parent Pension Plans that are intended to be qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code are so qualified and have been the subject of determination
or opinion letters from the IRS to the effect that such Parent Pension Plans
are so qualified and all related trusts that are intended to be exempt from
federal income taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code have been the subject of
determination or opinion letters from the IRS to the effect that such trusts
are so exempt, and no such determination or opinion letter has been revoked
nor, to the Knowledge of Parent, has revocation been threatened or any fact or
event occurred that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect the
qualified status of any such Parent Pension Plan or the exempt status of any
such trust, nor has any such Parent Pension Plan been amended since the date
of its most recent determination or opinion letter or application therefor in
any respect that would adversely affect its qualification or materially
increase its costs. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any liability
or obligation under any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement to
provide benefits after termination of employment to any current or former
employee (including retirees) or dependent other than as required by Section
4980B of the Code. None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has any liability for a failure to comply with
Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA.

(c) None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their respective ERISA
Affiliates currently maintains, contributes to or has any liability under or,
at any time during the past six (6) years has maintained or contributed to,
any plan which is subject to Section 412 of the Code, Section 302 of ERISA or
Title IV of ERISA. None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary or any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates currently maintains, contributes to or has any
liability under or, at any time during the past six (6) years has maintained
or contributed to, any multiemployer plan (as defined in Section 4001 (a)(3)
of ERISA) or multiple employer plan (as described in Section 413 of the Code).
None of Parent, any Parent Subsidiary, any officer of Parent or of any Parent
Subsidiary or any of the Parent Benefit Plans which are subject to ERISA,
including the Parent Pension Plans, any trusts created thereunder or any
trustee or administrator thereof, has engaged in a "prohibited transaction"
(as such term is defined in Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code)
or any other breach of fiduciary responsibility. No Parent Benefit Plan is or
has been funded by, associated with or related to a voluntary employees'
beneficiary association (within the meaning of Section 501(c)(9) of the



47 

Code). No Parent Benefit Plan holds the stock of the Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary as a plan asset.

(d) With respect to Parent Pension Plans that are subject to or governed by
the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the United States (the "Non-US Parent
Pension Plans"), except as would not be material individually or in the
aggregate, (i) the fair market value of the assets of each funded Non-US
Parent Pension Plan, the liability of each insurer for any Non-US Parent
Pension Plan funded through insurance or the reserve shown on Parent's
financial statements for any unfunded Non-US Parent Pension Plan, together
with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide for the
projected benefit obligations, as of the First Effective Time, with respect to
all current and former participants in such plan based on reasonable, country
specific actuarial assumptions and valuations and no transaction contemplated
by this Agreement shall cause such assets or insurance obligations or book
reserve to be less than such projected benefit obligations and (ii) each Non-
US Parent Pension Plan required to be registered with a Governmental Entity
has been registered, has been maintained in good standing with the appropriate
Governmental Entities and has been maintained and operated in all respects in
accordance with its terms and is in compliance with all applicable Law.

(e) With respect to any arrangement of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary that is
subject to Section 409A of the Code, (i) the written terms of such arrangement
has at all times since January 1, 2013 been in material compliance with, and
(ii) such arrangement has, at all times while subject to Section 409A of the
Code, been operated in material compliance with, Section 409A of the Code and
all applicable guidance thereunder. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary
has any obligation to provide any gross-up payment to any individual with
respect to any income tax, additional tax or interest charge imposed pursuant
to Section 409A of the Code.

(f) With respect to any Parent Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan, (i) no such Parent Benefit Plan is unfunded or funded through a
"welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code) and (ii) each such Parent Benefit Plan that is a "group health plan" (as
such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code) complies with the
applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code.

(g) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of the Mergers or any other Transactions by
any employee, officer or director of Parent or any of its Affiliates who is a
"disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.280G-1), either alone or together with any other event, would be
characterized as a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G of the
Code). Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has any obligation to provide
any gross-up payment to any individual with respect to any income tax,
additional tax or interest charge imposed pursuant to Section 4999 of the
Code.

(h) The execution, delivery and performance by Parent of this Agreement do
not, and the consummation of the Mergers and the other Transactions and
compliance with the terms hereof and thereof will not (i) entitle any
employee, officer or director of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to any
severance, transaction bonus, retention or other payment, (ii) accelerate the
time of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or



48 

otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the amount payable or
trigger any other material obligation pursuant to, any Parent Benefit Plan or
Parent Benefit Agreement or (iii) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any Parent Benefit Plan or Parent Benefit Agreement.

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, "Parent Pension Plans" means all "employee
pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) established or
maintained by Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

SECTION 5.21. Employee and Labor Matters. Neither Parent nor any Parent
Subsidiary is a party to any collective bargaining Contract or any labor
Contract. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary has engaged in any unfair
labor practice or violation of state or local labor, wage and hour, or
employment laws with respect to any Persons employed by or otherwise
performing services primarily for Parent or any Parent Subsidiary (the "Parent
Business Personnel"), and there is no material unfair labor practice complaint
or grievance or other administrative or judicial complaint, action or
investigation pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened in writing
against Parent or any of Parent Subsidiaries by the National Labor Relations
Board, any comparable state or federal agency, or any other Third Party with
respect to Parent Business Personnel. There is no labor strike, dispute,
slowdown or stoppage pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened
against or affecting Parent or any Parent Subsidiary which may interfere with
the respective business activities of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary.

SECTION 5.22. Opinions of Financial Advisors. The Parent Board has received
the oral opinion of Raymond James and Associates, Inc., to be confirmed in
writing (with a copy provided solely for informational purposes to the Company
promptly after Parent receiving such confirmation), to the effect that, as of
such date, the Exchange Ratio applicable to the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be issued in the First Merger by Parent is fair to Parent from a financial
point of view.

SECTION 5.23. Brokers. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person, other than Raymond James and Associates, Inc. and their respective
affiliates, the fees and expenses of which will be paid by Parent, is entitled
to any broker's, finder's, financial advisor's or other similar fee or
commission in connection with the Mergers or the other Transactions based upon
arrangements made by or on behalf of Parent.

SECTION 5.24. Rights Plan. Parent has taken all action necessary (a) to render
the Rights Agreement, dated July 20, 2012 (the "Parent Rights Agreement"),
between Parent and Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, as Rights
Agent, inapplicable to the Mergers, the other Transactions, this Agreement and
the Stockholders Agreement, and (b) to ensure that (i) neither the Sole
Stockholder nor any Sole Stockholder Member will become an "Acquiring Person"
or "Adverse Person" (as such terms are defined in the Parent Rights Agreement)
by reason of the approval, execution, announcement or consummation of this
Agreement, the Stockholders Agreement or the Transactions, and (ii) neither a
"Share Acquisition Date" nor a "Distribution Date" (each as defined in the
Parent Rights Agreement) shall occur, in each case, by reason of the approval,
execution, announcement or consummation of this Agreement, the Stockholders
Agreement or the Transactions.

(a) Except for matters set forth in Section 6.01(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter or otherwise expressly required by this Agreement or by Law, from the
date of this Agreement to the First Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause each Company Subsidiary to, conduct its business in the usual,
regular and ordinary course in substantially the same manner as previously

efforts to preserve intact its current business organization, maintain in
effect all material Permits, keep available the services of its current

addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, except for
matters set forth in Section 6.01(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter or
otherwise expressly required by this Agreement or by Law, from the date of
this Agreement to the First Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall
not permit any Company Subsidiary to (or permit any other person to on behalf
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary), do any of the following without the
prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except that such consent may be withheld in
Parent's sole discretion with respect to Section 6.01(a)(i)(A)):

(i) (A) declare, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any other
distributions in respect of, any of its capital stock, other than dividends
and distributions by a direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company to its parent or, after June 30, 2016, quarterly dividends not to

shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries and its and their respective
Representatives to, immediately cease and terminate any discussions or
negotiations existing as of the date of this Agreement between Parent or any
of the Parent Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives,
on the one hand, and any Third Party or any of its Representatives, on the
other hand, with respect to any Parent Takeover Proposal or any inquiry,
proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead to a Parent
Takeover Proposal and shall seek to have returned to it any confidential

discussions or negotiations.

(d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.03(e) or 6.03(f), neither the
Parent Board nor any committee thereof shall (A) withhold or withdraw (or
modify in a manner adverse to the Company), or propose publicly to withhold or
withdraw (or so modify) the Parent Recommendation or the Parent Determination,
(B) recommend, endorse, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to recommend,

intent or agreement in principle or any Contract (other than a confidentiality
agreement executed in accordance with Section 6.03(a)) providing for any
Parent Takeover Proposal or (C) take any action to make the provisions of any
Takeover Laws or any restrictive provision of any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Parent Charter or Parent Byâ€‘laws, inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Parent Takeover Proposal (any action described
in clause (A), (B) or (C) being referred to as a "Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change").

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in response to
a Parent Takeover Proposal, the Parent Board may at any time prior to receipt
of Parent Stockholder Approval, effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change,
and, subject to compliance with the requirements of this Section 6.03(e) and
Section 7.07(c), terminate this Agreement in order to concurrently enter into
a binding definitive agreement to effect a Superior



59 

Parent Proposal, if (and only if): (i) such Parent Takeover Proposal was not
solicited in violation of Section 6.03(a); (ii) such Parent Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Parent Proposal; and (iii) Parent provides the Company
at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice of the Parent Board's
intention to take such action, which notice shall include the information with
respect to such Superior Parent Proposal that is specified in Section 6.03(b)
(it being agreed that neither the delivery of such notice by Parent nor any
public announcement thereof that Parent determines that it is required to make
under applicable Law shall constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
unless and until the Parent Board shall have failed to, within twenty-four
(24) hours after such three (3) Business Day period, publicly announce that it
is recommending the Transactions (taking into account any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions agreed to by
the parties hereto in writing)); (iv) during such three (3) Business Day
period, Parent and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with the
Company regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the
Transactions proposed by the Company in response to such Superior Parent
Proposal; (v) at the end of the three (3) Business Day period described in the
foregoing clause (iv) (and taking into account any adjustment or modification
of the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions proposed by the Company)
the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
legal and financial advisors, that the Parent Takeover Proposal continues to
be a Superior Parent Proposal; (vi) concurrently with the termination of this
Agreement, Parent pays to the Company the Termination Fee; and (vii)
concurrently with the termination of this Agreement (or, if not determined at
such time, as soon thereafter as the amount of Company Expenses is
determined), Parent pays to the Company any Company Expenses due pursuant to
Section 7.07(c)(iii). Any material amendment or modification to any Superior
Parent Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any change in the
consideration to be received is a material modification) will be deemed to be
a new Parent Takeover Proposal for purposes of this Section 6.03; provided,
however, that with respect to each and every material amendment or
modification, the notice period and the period during which Parent and its
Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith with the Company
regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions
pursuant to clause (v) above shall expire on the second (2nd) Business Day
after the Parent Board provides written notice of such new Parent Takeover
Proposal to the Company.

(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or restrict the Parent Board, in
circumstances not involving or relating to a Parent Takeover Proposal, from
effecting prior to obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change of the type described in clause (A) of the definition
thereof, if (and only if): (i) the Parent Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the exercise of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws; (ii) Parent
provides the Company at least three (3) Business Days' prior written notice
advising the Company that the Parent Board intends to take such action and
specifying the reasons therefor in reasonable detail (it being agreed that
neither the delivery of such notice by Parent nor any public announcement
thereof that the Parent Board determines that it is required to make under
applicable Law shall constitute a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change unless
and until the Parent Board shall have failed to, within twenty-four (24) hours
after such three (3) Business Day period, publicly announce that it is
recommending the Transactions (taking into account any adjustment or
modification of the terms



60 

of this Agreement and the Transactions agreed to by the parties hereto in
writing)); (iii) during such three (3) Business Day period, Parent and its
Representatives have negotiated in good faith with the Company regarding any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions proposed by the
Company in response to such conclusion that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the
stockholders of Parent under applicable Laws; and (iv) at the end of the three
(3) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause (iii), the Parent
Board again concludes in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any adjustment or
modification of the terms of this Agreement and the Transactions proposed by
the Company), that the failure to make a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the exercise by the Parent
Board of its fiduciary duties under applicable Laws.

(g) During the period from the date of this Agreement through the earlier of
the Second Effective Time and the date of termination of this Agreement,
Parent shall not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any
confidentiality agreement relating to a Parent Takeover Proposal or standstill
agreement to which Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries is a party (other
than any involving the Company) except to the extent the Parent Board
determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel
that the failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations
under applicable Law.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.03 shall prohibit the Parent Board
from (i) taking and disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a
statement contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to the
stockholders of Parent if the Parent Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with its outside counsel, that such disclosure is required by
applicable Law; provided, however, that (A) any disclosure of a position
contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act
other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, an express rejection of
any applicable Parent Takeover Proposal or an express reaffirmation of the
Parent Recommendation, shall be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change and (B) neither Parent nor the Parent Board (nor any committee thereof)
shall make any Parent Adverse Recommendation Change except in accordance with
the other provisions of this Section 6.03.

(i) Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

"Parent Acquisition Transaction" means any transaction or series of related
transactions other than the Mergers involving: (i) any acquisition or purchase
by any Third Party of more than 20% of the total outstanding voting securities
of Parent or any of the Significant Parent Subsidiaries; (ii) any tender offer
or exchange offer that if consummated would result in any Third Party
beneficially owning more than 20% of the total outstanding voting securities
of Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries; (iii) any merger, amalgamation,
plan of arrangement, consolidation, business combination, share



61 

exchange, recapitalization or similar transaction involving Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary pursuant to which the stockholders of Parent immediately
preceding such transaction hold less than 80% of the equity interests in the
surviving or resulting entity of such transaction; (iv) any direct or indirect
acquisition of any business or businesses or of assets (including equity
interests in any Parent Subsidiary) that constitute or account for 20% or more
of the consolidated net revenues, net income or assets (based on the fair
market value thereof) of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole;
or (v) any liquidation or dissolution of Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries.

"Parent Takeover Proposal" means any offer or proposal by a Third Party
relating to any Parent Acquisition Transaction.

"Superior Parent Proposal" means a bona fide written Parent Takeover Proposal
(with (1) references therein to "20%" changed to "50%", except in the case of
any Parent Acquisition Transaction by an individual Person or group of Persons
(as described in Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), in which case
references to "20%" shall be changed to "40%", and (2) references therein to
"80%" changed to "50%", except in the case of any Parent Acquisition
Transaction by an individual Person or group of Persons (as described in Rule
13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act), in which case references to "80%" shall
be changed to "60%") that, in the good faith judgment of the Parent Board,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and its outside legal
counsel, taking into account relevant legal, financial and regulatory aspects
of the proposal, the identity of the Third Party making such proposal and the
conditions for completion of such proposal (i) if consummated, would be more
favorable to the stockholders of Parent than the Mergers, taken together,
taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and this
Agreement (including any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by
the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise), and (ii) is reasonably
likely to be consummated.

SECTION 6.04. Section 280G. If the Company or Parent reasonably determines
that any payment or benefit in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement could be deemed a Section 280G Payment (as defined below) by
more than a de minimis amount, prior to the Closing, the Sole Stockholder
shall, in advance of the Closing Date, seek waivers of the right to receive
such payments or benefits ("Section 280G Payments") from "disqualified
individuals" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code), to the extent
necessary and appropriate to avoid any loss of Tax deduction by reason of
Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder or any excise Tax
under Section 4999 of the Code, and, if such waivers are received, deliver to
its equityholders (whether direct or indirect to the extent required) a
disclosure statement which is intended to satisfy, and which is intended to
solicit approval by its equityholders, in each case in a manner that complies
with Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder, of the
right of any "disqualified individual" to receive or retain any payments or
benefits that would reasonably be expected, in the absence of such approval by
such equityholders, to constitute "excess parachute payments" (as defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). The Sole Stockholder shall provide Parent and
its Representatives with a copy of such disclosure statement prior to delivery
to the members of the Sole Stockholder and shall



62 

consider in good faith any reasonable comments timely made by Parent or its
Representatives regarding the content of such disclosure statement.

ARTICLE VII 

 
Additional Agreements

SECTION 7.01. Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meetings.

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare, and Parent shall file with
the SEC, the Proxy Statement. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate
in the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement (including by the Company
providing Parent with the financial statements and financial data of the
Company necessary for inclusion in the Proxy Statement as well as any other
information necessary for Parent to prepare the pro forma financial statements
required for the Proxy Statement). Parent shall provide the Company with the
opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement prior to its filing
with the SEC. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement
will be made by Parent without providing the Company the opportunity to review
and comment thereon. Parent will advise the Company promptly after it receives
oral or written notice of any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment
of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests
by the SEC for additional information, and will promptly provide the Company
with copies of any written communication from the SEC or any state securities
commission. If at any time prior to the First Effective Time any information
relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective Affiliates,
officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company which should be
set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that any of
such documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party and an
appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed by Parent with the SEC, after the Company has had a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment thereon, and, to the extent required by
applicable Law, disseminated to the respective stockholders of Parent.

(b) Subject to applicable Law, Parent shall, as soon as reasonably practicable
following date of this Agreement, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after distribution of the Proxy Statement to Parent's stockholders, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders (the "Parent
Stockholders Meeting") for the purpose of seeking the Parent Stockholder
Approval. Subject to Section 6.03(e) and 6.03(f), Parent shall, through the
Parent Board, recommend that its stockholders approve the Share Issuance (the
"Parent Recommendation"), and shall use reasonable best efforts to solicit
from its stockholders proxies in favor of the Share Issuance. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent may adjourn, recess or
postpone the Parent Stockholders Meeting from time to time (a) with the prior
written consent of the Company; (b) to the extent necessary to ensure that any
supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement required by applicable Law (as
determined by



63 

Parent in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel) is
provided to the stockholders of Parent a reasonable amount of time in advance
of the Parent Stockholders Meeting to permit such stockholders to review such
supplement or amendment prior to the Parent Stockholders Meeting; (c) if as of
the time at which the Parent Stockholders Meeting is to be held, (x) there is
an absence of a quorum (either in person or by proxy) necessary to conduct the
business of the Parent Stockholders Meeting, or (y) it is necessary to solicit
additional proxies in order to obtain approval of the Share Issuance; or (d)
if required by Law or any court of competent jurisdiction.

SECTION 7.02. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to contractual
and legal restrictions applicable to Parent or the Company or any of their
respective subsidiaries with respect to the exchange of information, each of
the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective
subsidiaries to, afford to the other party and to the Representatives of such
other party, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period
prior to the First Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all
their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and
records (including the work papers of independent accountants, if available,
and subject to the consent of such independent accountants), including for
purposes of Parent and its Representatives, to conduct audits from time to
time of the Company's and the Company Subsidiaries' practices and procedures
pursuant to applicable Insurance Laws and, during such period, each of the
Company and Parent shall, and shall cause each of its respective subsidiaries
to, furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws and (b) all
other information concerning its business, properties and personnel as such
other party may reasonably request; provided, however, that (A) such access
does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, or Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, as applicable,
and (B) if either Parent or the Company requests detailed information on a
per-insured basis contained in electronic databases, the other party shall be
obligated only to provide such information to TigerRisk Partners, LLC for
analysis. No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall affect any
representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any
condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. This Section 7.02 shall
not require the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, to permit any access, or to disclose any information, that in the
reasonable judgment of such party, would reasonably be expected to result in
(i) the disclosure of any trade secrets of Third Parties or a violation of any
of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if such party shall have
used its reasonable best efforts to obtain the consent of such Third Party to
such inspection or disclosure, (ii) the loss of attorney-client privilege with
respect to such information, (iii) in the case of documents or portions of
documents relating to pricing or other matters that are highly sensitive, a
Governmental Entity alleging that providing such information violates any
Regulatory Law or (iv) a violation of applicable privacy Laws. If any material
is withheld by such party pursuant to the preceding sentence, such party shall
inform the other party as to the general nature of what is being withheld. All
information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.



64 

SECTION 7.03. Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (subject to,
and in accordance with, applicable Law), to take promptly, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers
and the other Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all necessary
actions or nonactions and Consents from Governmental Entities and Nasdaq and
the making of all necessary registrations and Filings and the taking of all
steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid a
Proceeding by, any Governmental Entity or Nasdaq, (ii) the obtaining of all
necessary Consents from Third Parties, and (iii) the execution and delivery of
any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions; provided,
however, that in no event shall Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or the Company
Parties or any of their respective subsidiaries be required to (and in no
event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary without the prior written
consent of Parent, or Parent or any Parent Subsidiary without the prior
written consent of the Company) pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to
any Third Party or make any other concession to any Third Party for any
Consent required for the consummation of the Transactions under any Contract.

(b) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided and without limiting
the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall (i) to the extent required, (A)
promptly, but in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days after the date
hereof, make their respective Filings under the HSR Act and (B) as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date hereof, make any other required
submissions under the HSR Act (which submissions shall be in substantial
compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act and any other applicable Law),
(ii) promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) calendar days after the
date hereof, make, or cause their respective "ultimate controlling persons" to
make, all filings necessary under the Insurance Laws, including the Company
Insurance Approvals and Parent Insurance Approvals (including filings on Form
A seeking approval of Parent's acquisition of control of each applicable
Company Insurance Subsidiary and Peed's and the Sole Stockholder's acquisition
of control of each applicable Parent Insurance Subsidiary), with the Insurance
Regulators in Florida, Hawaii and New York, as applicable, and promptly make
any further filings pursuant thereto as may be necessary or advisable, (iii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other in (A)
determining whether any Filings are required to be made with, or Consents are
required to be obtained from, any Third Parties or other Governmental Entities
in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Transactions and (B) timely making all such Filings (which
Filings shall be in substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable
Law) and timely seeking all such Consents and (iv) use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and do, or cause to
be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective the Transactions, including taking all such further action as
may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the United States
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, any Insurance
Regulator, or any other Governmental Entity may assert under



65 

Regulatory Law with respect to the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or any Company Party
be required to (and in no event shall the Company or any Company Subsidiary
agree to without the prior written consent of Parent, or Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary agree to without the prior written consent of the Company) divest
any assets, provide any guaranty, contribution of capital, keepwell agreement
or capital maintenance arrangement, restrict dividends or distributions, or
agree to divest any assets or consent to or take any other action or agree to
any limitation or make any concession or other undertaking which would
individually, or together with all other such divestitures, agreements,
consents, actions, limitations or concessions, be reasonably likely to
materially and adversely affect (x) the benefits expected to be derived by
Parent or the Sole Stockholder and the Sole Stockholder Members, as
applicable, as a result of the Mergers, (y) the business of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries or of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, in each
case as currently conducted, or (z) the business of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as contemplated to be conducted on a combined basis with
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries following the Mergers (any such
requirement, individually or together with all other such requirements, a
"Burdensome Regulatory Action"). Subject to applicable legal limitations and
the instructions of any Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent shall keep
each other apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices
or other communications received by the Company or Parent, as the case may be,
or any of their respective subsidiaries, from any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to such transactions. The Company and Parent
shall permit counsel for the other party reasonable opportunity to review in
advance, and consider in good faith, the views of the other party in
connection with, any proposed written communication to any Governmental
Entity. Each of the Company and Parent agrees, to the extent reasonably
feasible, not to participate in any meeting or discussion (other than relating
to non-substantive matters such as the scheduling of any meetings or of any
discussions), either in person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity
in connection with the proposed transactions unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental
Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate. The
Company and Parent shall furnish the other with such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with
its preparation of necessary Filings or submissions of information to any
Governmental Entity. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, Parent or the Company shall have the right to direct all matters
with any Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder. Either
Parent or the Company may designate any competitively sensitive information
provided to the other under this Agreement as "outside counsel only". Such
materials and the information contained therein shall be given only to outside
legal counsel of the other and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel
to employees, officers or directors of their client unless express written
permission is obtained in advance from the disclosing party or its legal
counsel.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 7.03, if any Proceeding, including any Proceeding by
a private party, is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging
any Transaction as violative of any Regulatory Law, each of the Company and
Parent shall cooperate in all respects with each other and shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such



66 

Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Judgment
that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of
the Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 7.03 shall limit a party's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(b)(i) or 9.01(b)(ii).

SECTION 7.04. AmRisc Agreements. Prior to the First Effective Time, the
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, enforce all of the
terms of the AmRisc Agreements. Prior to the First Effective Time, without the
prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall not (or permit any of the
Company Subsidiaries to), (a) amend, waive or modify any AmRisc Agreement in a
manner adverse to the Company or (b) terminate any AmRisc Agreement. The
Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, comply with all
AmRisc Agreements. The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably
current basis of any material changes in the relationship with or developments
with respect to AmRisc or any of its subsidiaries, including delivering to
Parent copies of all material notices the Company receives under the AmRisc
Agreements, and shall furnish promptly to Parent such information concerning
the status of the relationship with AmRisc and its subsidiaries as Parent may
reasonably request.

SECTION 7.05. Termination of Affiliated Person Contracts. Except as otherwise
determined by Parent, the Company, the Sole Stockholder and the Sole
Stockholder Member Parties shall cause all Affiliated Person Contracts and all
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, if any, required to be
listed on Section 3.22 of the Company Disclosure Letter (except those
Affiliated Person Contracts and obligations set forth on Schedule 7.05), and
any Affiliated Person Contracts or obligations arising between the date hereof
and the Closing Date which would have been required to be included on Section
3.22 of the Company Disclosure Letter if they had existed as of the date
hereof, to be terminated immediately prior to the Closing, in each case,
without any recourse or liability to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or
any of its or their respective officers, directors or employees (such
Affiliated Person Contracts and obligations to be terminated, the "Specified
Affiliated Person Contracts and Obligations"). The Sole Stockholder and the
Company shall provide Parent with documentation reasonably satisfactory to
Parent of the termination of such Affiliated Person Contracts and Obligations.

SECTION 7.06. Releases; Director and Officer Indemnification.

(a) In consideration of the benefits derived herefrom for the Sole Stockholder
and the Sole Stockholder Member Parties, the Sole Stockholder and each Sole
Stockholder Member Party, on behalf of itself, himself or herself and each of
its, his or her Affiliates (collectively for purposes of this Section 7.06,
the "Releasing Parties") hereby consents to the transactions contemplated
under this Agreement and each Ancillary Agreement. Effective as of the
Closing, each of the Releasing Parties hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and
completely forever releases, acquits and discharges each of the Releasees (as
defined below) from and against any and all Claims (as defined below), whether
at law or in equity, that such Releasing Party may have against any of the
Releasees, directly or indirectly relating to or arising out of any events,
matters, causes, things, acts, omissions or conduct occurring or existing at
any time up to and including the Closing Date and relating directly or
indirectly to such Releasing Party's



67 

current or former employment or consulting relationship with the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or current or former status as a manager, director,
member, equity holder, option holder, warrant holder or debt holder of the
Company or any Company Subsidiary, other than any Claim arising under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, (a)
"Releasees" means the Company and each Company Subsidiary, and each of their
respective officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, Affiliates,
agents, representatives, successors and assigns, and (b) "Claim" means all
past, present and future disputes, claims, controversies, demands, rights,
liabilities and Proceedings of every kind and nature, including: (i) any
unknown, unripe, inchoate, unsuspected or undisclosed claim; and (ii) any
claim, right or Proceeding based upon any breach of any express or implied
Contract (excluding, in each case, all obligations in respect of such
Releasee's position as an employee, officer or director (or similar role) of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary with respect to indemnification rights
under any Contract or organizational document of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary made available to Parent prior to the date of this Agreement.

(b) Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses
and exculpation by the Company or any Company Subsidiaries now existing in
favor of each Person who is now, or has been prior to the date hereof, a
Person eligible for such indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation as provided in the articles of incorporation, by-laws or
indemnification agreements of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each
case as in effect on the date hereof and in the forms made available to Parent
prior to the date hereof, shall survive the Closing and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their respective terms to the fullest
extent permissible under Delaware Law. For a period of six (6) years following
the Closing Date, Parent and the Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Parent Subsidiary or Company Subsidiary to, take any action to disaffirm or
adversely affect the provisions of such organizational documents or other
written agreements of the Company or such Company Subsidiary that provide
indemnification of and expense reimbursement to such Persons.

SECTION 7.07. Fees and Expenses.

(a) Except as provided below, all fees and expenses incurred in connection
with the Mergers and the other Transactions, including the fees and
disbursements of counsel, financial advisors and accountants, shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Mergers are
consummated.

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(iii) then the Parent shall reimburse the Company upon demand by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account specified in writing by
the Company for all Transaction Expenses of the Company and its Affiliates,
not to exceed $1,500,000 (the "Company Expenses"), within two (2) Business
Days after receipt of notice by the Company of all such Transaction Expenses.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if (i)(A) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section
9.01(b)(iii), (B) (1) a Parent Takeover Proposal existed between the date
hereof and the Parent Stockholders Meeting



68 

(or the postponement or adjournment thereof) and had been publicly announced
or otherwise publicly made known to the stockholders of Parent during such
period and (2) such Parent Takeover Proposal was not publicly withdrawn prior
to the Parent Stockholder Meeting, and (C) concurrently with, or within twelve
(12) months after any such termination any Parent Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or Parent or any of the Parent Subsidiaries enters into any
definitive agreement to effect any Parent Acquisition Transaction (which, in
either case, need not be pursuant to such Parent Takeover Proposal), (ii) this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.01(f) or (iii)
this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 9.01(g) then, in
each case, Parent shall pay to the Sole Stockholder a fee equal to
$9,311,000.00 (the "Termination Fee") by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account specified in writing by the Company, plus, if
not previously paid pursuant to Section 7.07(b), the aggregate amount of any
Company Expenses and such payments to be made promptly, but in no event later
than, in the case of clause (i), the earlier to occur of (A) the date on which
such Parent Acquisition Transaction is consummated and (B) the date on which
Parent enters into such definitive agreement to effect a Parent Acquisition
Transaction or effects such Parent Acquisition Transaction or, in the case of
clause (ii), two (2) Business Days after such termination or, in the case of
clause (iii), concurrently with the termination of this Agreement; provided,
however, that if Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(g)
within forty-five (45) days of the date of this Agreement, the Termination Fee
shall be $4,655,000.00.

(d) Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.07 are
an integral part of the Transactions, and that, without these agreements the
Company would not have entered into this Agreement; accordingly, if Parent
fails to promptly pay the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.07(b) or 7.07(c),
and, in order to obtain such payment the Company commences a suit which
results in a Judgment against Parent for any of the amounts set forth in
Section 7.07(b) or Section 7.07(c) then Parent shall pay to the Company its
costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit,
together with interest on the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.07(b) or
Section 7.07(c) at the prime rate of interest reported in The Wall Street
Journal in effect on the date of payment plus 5% per annum from the date such
amounts were required to be paid until the date actually received by such
party.

(e) For purposes of this Section 7.07, "Parent Acquisition Transaction" shall
have the meaning ascribed thereto in Section 6.03(i), except that references
in such definition to "20%" and "80%" shall be replaced by "50%" (including
with respect to the definition of "Parent Takeover Proposal" for purposes of
this Section 7.07).

SECTION 7.08. Public Announcements. Parent, Merger Sub and Merger LLC, on the
one hand, and the Company Parties, on the other hand, shall consult with each
other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to review and
comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
Mergers and the other Transactions and shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except to the
extent required by Law, court process, by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange, or with respect to any Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Takeover Proposal in accordance with
Section 6.03.



69 

SECTION 7.09. Transfer Taxes. All stock transfer, real estate transfer,
documentary, stamp, recording and other similar Taxes imposed on Merger Sub,
Merger LLC, the Company or the Surviving Corporation (including interest,
penalties and additions to any such Taxes) ("Transfer Taxes") incurred in
connection with the Transactions shall be paid by any of Merger Sub, Merger
LLC or the Surviving Corporation, and the Company shall cooperate with Merger
Sub, Merger LLC and Parent in preparing, executing and filing any Tax Returns
with respect to such Transfer Taxes.

SECTION 7.10. Stock Exchange Listing. Parent shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the First
Merger and under the Company Stock Plans to be approved for listing on Nasdaq,
subject to official notice of issuance, prior to the First Effective Time.

SECTION 7.11. Tax Matters.

(a) If there is a determination within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code that the First Merger by itself or taken together with the Second Merger,
does not qualify as a reorganization described in Section 368(a) of the Code,
Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, the Sole Stockholder, and the Sole
Stockholder Member Parties shall take the position for federal income tax
purposes that the First Merger was a qualified stock purchase within the
meaning of Section 338 of the Code and the Second Merger qualified as a
liquidation described in Section 332 of the Code.

(b) Parent shall ensure that the continuity of business enterprise requirement
of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-1(d) is satisfied in connection
with the transactions provided for herein.

(c) Parent covenants that neither Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, nor a
"related person" (as defined for purposes of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e)(4)) with respect to Parent (a "Related Person"), nor any entity or
arrangement that is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes
and in which Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, or a Related Person is treated
for federal income tax purposes as owning a direct or indirect interest, will,
in connection with the Mergers (as determined for purposes of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.368-1(e)), redeem or otherwise acquire any of the shares
of Parent Common Stock transferred in connection with the Mergers, such that
the continuity of interest requirement of U.S. Treasury Regulations Section
1.368-1(e) is not satisfied.

(d) Parent covenants that neither Parent, the Parent Subsidiaries, nor any of
their Affiliates, nor a Related Person, nor any entity or arrangement that is
treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and in which Parent,
the Parent Subsidiaries, or a Related Person is treated for federal income tax
purposes as owning a direct or indirect interest will take any action that
would cause the First Merger, taken together with the Second Merger, to fail
to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

(e) Parent shall not undertake, and shall not permit the Parent Subsidiaries
to undertake, any transaction in connection with or otherwise as part of a
plan including the



70 

Mergers, after the Second Effective Time, that would cause it directly to own

that such subsequent date was the Closing Date) and (ii) cannot be or has not
been cured within 30 days after the giving by Parent of written notice to the

perform any of its respective representations, warranties or covenants
contained in this Agreement or any of such representations and warranties

liability or obligation on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, Merger LLC or the
Company Parties, other than Section 7.07, this Section 9.02 and Article X,
which provisions shall survive such termination; provided, however, that,
except as provided in Section 7.07(d), nothing contained in this Section 9.02
shall relieve any party hereto from any liability for any willful and material
breach of a representation or warranty or any willful and material breach of
any covenant contained in this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement
shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality

by or pursuant to action taken by their respective Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of the matters presented in connection with the

not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of
