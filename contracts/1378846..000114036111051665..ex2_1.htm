AGREEMENT

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises
contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties to this
Agreement agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE 1

  

THE OFFER AND THE MERGER

  

  

1.1 The Offer

  

  

(a) As promptly as practicable (and in any event within ten Business Days
after the date hereof), the Purchaser shall commence, within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the "Exchange Act"), the Offer
to purchase all the outstanding Shares at the Offer Price. The consummation of
the Offer, and the obligation of the Purchaser to accept for payment and pay
for Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, shall be subject to: (i) there
being validly tendered in the Offer and not properly withdrawn prior to the
Expiration Date that number of Shares which, together with the number of
Shares (if any) then owned of record by Parent or any of its wholly-owned
direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, or with respect to
which Parent or any of its wholly-owned direct or indirect Subsidiaries,
including the Purchaser, otherwise has, directly or indirectly, sole voting
power, represents at least a majority of the Shares then outstanding
(determined on a fully diluted basis) and no less than a majority of the
voting power of the shares of capital stock of the Company then outstanding
(determined on a fully diluted basis) and entitled to vote upon the adoption
of this Agreement and approval of the Merger (excluding from the number of
tendered Shares, but not from the number of outstanding Shares, Shares
tendered pursuant to guaranteed delivery procedures that have not yet been
delivered in settlement or satisfaction of such guarantee) (collectively, the
"Minimum Condition") and (ii) the satisfaction, or waiver by the Purchaser, of
the other conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I. The conditions and
requirements to the Offer set forth in Annex I are for the sole benefit of the
Purchaser and may be asserted by the Purchaser in its reasonable judgment
regardless of the circumstances giving rise to such condition or may be waived
by the Purchaser, in its sole discretion, in whole or in part at any time and
from time to time, subject to this Section 1.1.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Subject to the satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction,
or waiver by the Purchaser, of the other conditions and requirements set forth
in Annex I, the Purchaser shall accept for payment and pay for all Shares
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer promptly.
The Offer Price payable in respect of each Share validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer shall be paid to the seller in cash,
without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable
Law. To the extent any such amounts are so withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

  

  

(c) The Offer shall be made by means of an offer to purchase (the "Offer to
Purchase") that describes the terms and conditions of the Offer in accordance
with this Agreement, including the Minimum Condition and the other conditions
and requirements set forth in Annex I. The Purchaser expressly reserves the
right to increase the Offer Price or to make any other changes in the terms
and conditions of the Offer; provided, however, that unless otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement or as previously approved by the Company in
writing, the Purchaser shall not (i) decrease the Offer Price, (ii) change the
form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) reduce the maximum number of
Shares to be purchased in the Offer, (iv) amend or waive the Minimum
Condition, (v) amend any of the other conditions and requirements to the Offer
set forth in Annex I in a manner materially adverse to the holders of Shares
or (vi) extend the Expiration Date in a manner other than in accordance with
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Offer Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Shares), cash dividend,
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, combination, exchange of
shares or other like change with respect to the Shares, occurring on or after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the Acceptance Time, and such
adjustment to the Offer Price shall provide to the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such action;
provided that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to permit the
Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is prohibited
by the terms of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) Unless extended in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Offer
shall expire at 12:00 midnight (New York City time) on the date that is 20
Business Days (calculated in accordance with Rule 14d-1(g)(3) under the
Exchange Act) following the commencement of the Offer (within the meaning of
Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) (such date and time, the "Initial
Expiration Date") or, if the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in
accordance with this Agreement, the date and time to which the Offer has been
so extended (the Initial Expiration Date, or such later date and time to which
the Initial Expiration Date has been extended in accordance with this
Agreement, the "Expiration Date").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) If on or prior to any then scheduled Expiration Date, all of the
conditions to the Offer (including the Minimum Condition and the other
conditions and requirements set forth in Annex I) have not been satisfied, or,
where permitted by applicable Law and this Agreement, waived by the Purchaser,
the Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer
on one or more occasions, for successive periods of up to 20 Business Days
each, until the satisfaction or, where permitted by applicable Law and this
Agreement, waiver by the Purchaser of such conditions. In addition, the
Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause the Purchaser to) extend the Offer for
any period or periods required by applicable Law or applicable rules,
regulations, interpretations or positions of the United States Securities and
Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or its staff. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser shall not be required to extend the
Offer for any reason beyond April 30, 2012 (the "Outside Date"); provided
however that if, as of such date, all conditions set forth in Annex I have
been satisfied other than either (i) obtaining the Required Governmental
Approval or (ii) both obtaining the Required Governmental Approval and
satisfying the Minimum Condition, then either Parent or the Company may, in
its sole discretion and pursuant to written notice to the other party no later
than two Business Days prior thereto and no earlier than five Business Days
prior thereto, extend such date for up to (but no more than) two successive 30
calendar day periods starting on May 1, 2012 (each such extension to be 30
days and, thereafter, the last date of each such additional thirty-day period
shall for all purposes of this Agreement be the "Outside Date") solely to
satisfy such condition(s); provided further that in no event shall the Outside
Date, as it may be extended pursuant to this Section 1.1(e), extend past June
30, 2012. Nothing in this Section 1.1(e) shall be deemed to impair, limit or
otherwise restrict in any manner the right of Parent or the Company to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 7 hereof.

  

  

(f) If necessary to obtain sufficient Shares to reach the Short Form Threshold
(without regard to the exercise of the Top-Up Option), the Purchaser may, in
its sole discretion, provide for a "subsequent offering period" (and one or
more extensions thereof) in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act
of up to 20 Business Days. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and the Offer, the Purchaser shall immediately accept for payment,
and pay for, all Shares that are validly tendered pursuant to the Offer during
such "subsequent offering period." The Offer Documents will provide for the
possibility of a "subsequent offering period" in a manner consistent with the
terms of this Section 1.1(f).

  

  

(g) The Purchaser shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled
Expiration Date without the prior written consent of the Company, except if
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article 7. If this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article 7, the Purchaser shall promptly (and in any
event no later than the end of the next Business Day following such
termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer. If the
Offer is terminated or withdrawn by the Purchaser, or this Agreement is
terminated prior to the purchase of Shares in the Offer, the Purchaser shall
promptly return, and shall cause any depositary acting on behalf of the
Purchaser to return, in accordance with applicable Law, all tendered Shares to
the registered holders thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) As soon as practicable on the date of the commencement of the Offer, the
Purchaser shall file with the SEC, in accordance with Rule 14d-3 under the
Exchange Act, a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the
"Schedule TO"). The Schedule TO shall include, as exhibits, the Offer to
Purchase, a form of letter of transmittal and a form of summary advertisement
(collectively, together with any amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto,
the "Offer Documents"). The Purchaser agrees to cause the Offer Documents to
be disseminated to holders of Shares, as and to the extent required by the
Exchange Act. The Company shall promptly furnish to Parent and the Purchaser
in writing all information concerning the Company that may be required by
applicable securities Laws or reasonably requested by Parent or the Purchaser
for inclusion in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents. The Purchaser, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct
any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents, if and to the
extent that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect
or as otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Purchaser agrees to cause
the Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required
by the Exchange Act. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents before they are
filed with the SEC, and the Purchaser shall give due consideration to the
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by the Company
and its counsel. In addition, the Purchaser shall provide the Company and its
counsel with copies of any written comments, and shall inform them of any oral
comments, that the Purchaser or its counsel may receive from time to time from
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule TO or the Offer Documents
promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written or oral responses
thereto. The Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to review any such written responses and the Purchaser shall give due
consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.

  

  

1.2 Company Actions

  

  

(a) On the date of the filing of the Schedule TO with the SEC, the Company
shall, in a manner that complies with Rule 14d-9 under the Exchange Act, file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 with respect to the Offer (together with all amendments, supplements and
exhibits thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") that shall, subject to the provisions
of Section 5.4(d), contain the Company Board Recommendation. The Company shall
also include in the Schedule 14D-9, and represents that it has obtained all
necessary consents of the Company Financial Advisor to permit the Company to
include in the Schedule 14D-9, in its entirety, the Fairness Opinion, together
with a summary thereof in accordance with Item 1015(b) of Regulation M-A under
the Exchange Act (regardless of whether such item is applicable). The Company
hereby consents to the inclusion in the Offer Documents, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.4(d), of the Company Board Recommendation. The Company
further agrees to cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be disseminated to holders of
Shares, as and to the extent required by the Exchange Act. To the extent
requested by the Purchaser, the Company shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
mailed or otherwise disseminated to the holders of Shares together with the
Offer Documents disseminated to the holders of Shares. The Company, on the one
hand, and the Purchaser, on the other hand, agree to promptly correct any
information provided by it for use in the Schedule 14D-9, if and to the extent
that it shall have become false or misleading in any material respect or as
otherwise required by applicable Law, and the Company agrees to cause the
Schedule 14D-9, as so corrected, to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to
holders of Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by the Exchange
Act. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to
review the Schedule 14D-9 before it is filed with the SEC, and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its counsel. In addition, the Company
shall provide the Purchaser and its counsel with copies of any written
comments, and shall inform them of any oral comments, that the Company or its
counsel may receive from time to time from the SEC or its staff with respect
to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such comments, and any written
or oral responses thereto. The Purchaser and its counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review any such written responses and the Company
shall give due consideration to the reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereto by the Purchaser and its counsel.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Promptly after the date hereof and otherwise from time to time as
requested by the Purchaser or its agents, the Company shall furnish or cause
to be furnished to the Purchaser mailing labels, security position listings,
non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any other listings or computer files
containing the names and addresses of the record or beneficial holders of the
Shares as of the most recent practicable date, and shall promptly furnish the
Purchaser with such information (including updated lists of holders of the
Shares and their addresses, mailing labels, security position listings and
non-objecting beneficial owner lists) and such other assistance as the
Purchaser or its agents may reasonably request in communicating with the
record and beneficial holders of Shares. In addition, in connection with the
Offer, the Company shall, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause any Third Parties to, cooperate with the Purchaser to disseminate the
Offer Documents to holders of Shares held in or subject to any Company Stock
Option Plan or other Benefit Plan, and to permit such holders of Shares to
tender Shares in the Offer.

  

  

1.3 Directors

  

  

(a) After the Purchaser accepts for payment such number of Shares tendered and
not properly withdrawn as represents no less than a majority of the voting
power of the shares of capital stock of the Company then outstanding
(determined on a fully diluted basis) pursuant to the Offer (the "Acceptance
Time"), and at all times thereafter, the Purchaser shall be entitled to elect
or designate such number of directors, rounded up to the next whole number, on
the Company Board as is equal to the product of the total number of directors
on the Company Board (giving effect to the directors elected or designated by
the Purchaser pursuant to this sentence) multiplied by the percentage that the
aggregate number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent and its direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, bears to the
total number of Shares then outstanding. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall, upon the Purchaser's request, take all actions as are necessary
or desirable to enable the Purchaser's designees to be so elected or
designated to the Company Board, including promptly filling vacancies or newly
created directorships on the Company Board, promptly increasing the size of
the Company Board (including by amending the Company Bylaws if necessary to
increase the size of the Company Board) and/or promptly securing the
resignations of such number of its incumbent directors, and shall cause the
Purchaser's designees to be so elected or designated at such time (any and all
members of the Company Board immediately prior to any designees of the
Purchaser joining the Company Board and who remain on the Company Board after
any designees of the Purchaser join the Company Board, the "Continuing
Directors"). If at any time the number of directors who are Continuing
Directors is reduced to zero, then the other directors on the Company Board
shall designate and appoint to the Company Board one director who is not a
stockholder or affiliate of Parent or the Purchaser (other than as a result of
such designation) and such director shall be deemed to be a Continuing
Director for purposes of this Agreement. After the Acceptance Time, the
Company shall also, upon the Purchaser's request, cause the directors elected
or designated by the Purchaser to the Company Board to serve on and constitute
the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the Company
Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of directors
(or similar body) of each Company Subsidiary and (iii) each committee (or
similar body) of each such board, in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the listing requirements of the NASDAQ Global Market
("NASDAQ"). After the Acceptance Time, the Company shall also, upon the
Purchaser's request, take all action necessary to elect to be treated as a
"controlled company" as defined by NASDAQ Rule 4350(c) and make all necessary
filings and disclosures associated with such status. The provisions of this
Section 1.3(a) are in addition to and shall not limit any rights that Parent
or its direct or indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser, may have as a
record holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a matter of applicable Law with
respect to the election of directors or otherwise.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

6  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint the Purchaser's designees to the
Company Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule
14f-1 promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions
required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3, including mailing to stockholders
(together with the Schedule 14D-9) any information required by Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 to enable the Purchaser's designees to be elected or designated
to the Company Board at the time or times contemplated by this Section 1.3.
The Purchaser shall supply or cause to be supplied to the Company any
information with respect to the Purchaser, its officers, directors and
affiliates, and the proposed designees to the Company Board required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1.

  

  

(c) In the event that the Purchaser's designees are elected or appointed to
the Company Board prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.3(a), and
without limiting Section 1.3(a), the Company shall cause the Company Board to
have at least such number of directors as may be required by the rules of the
NASDAQ or the federal securities Laws who are considered "independent
directors" within the meaning of such Laws ("Independent Directors");
provided, that in the event the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below the number as may be required by such Laws for any reason
whatsoever, the remaining Independent Director(s) shall be entitled to
designate Persons to fill such vacancies who shall be deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement or, if no other Independent Director
then remains, the other directors shall designate such number of directors as
may be required by the rules of the NASDAQ or the federal securities Laws, to
fill such vacancies who shall not be stockholders or affiliates of Parent or
the Purchaser, and such Persons shall be deemed to be Independent Directors
for purposes of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in
the event that the Purchaser's designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.3(a), and
without limiting Section 1.3(a), in addition to any approvals of the Company
Board or the stockholders of the Company as may be required by the Company
Charter, the Company Bylaws or applicable Law, the affirmative vote of a
majority of the Continuing Directors then in office (or, if there shall be
only one or two Continuing Directors then in office, all of such Continuing
Directors then in office) shall be required to authorize (and such
authorization shall not be effective unless there is in office at least one
(1) Continuing Director) (i) the Company's termination or amendment of this
Agreement or any Promissory Note, (ii) the Company's exercise or waiver of any
of the Company's rights, benefits or remedies under this Agreement, (iii) the
taking of any other action of the Company Board under or in connection with
this Agreement, in each case, if such termination, amendment, exercise, waiver
or other action would reasonably be expected to adversely affect in any
material respect the holders of Shares (other than Parent or its direct or
indirect Subsidiaries, including the Purchaser), (iv) except as otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company's amendment of the Company Charter
or the Company Bylaws or (v) any Contract between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or any if its Subsidiaries on the
other hand. The Continuing Directors shall have, and the Company Board shall
take all necessary action to cause the Continuing Directors to have, the
authority to retain such counsel (which may include current counsel to the
Company) and other advisors at the expense of the Company, as determined by
the Continuing Directors, and the authority to institute any action on behalf
of the Company to enforce performance of this Agreement.

the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation of the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation"). The Merger shall have the effects set forth in the
applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, at the Effective Time, all of the property, rights, privileges,
immunities, powers and franchises of the Company and the Purchaser shall vest

of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their
respective successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified,
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation. The
officers of the Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time, from and
after the Effective Time, shall continue as the officers of the Surviving
Corporation, each to hold office in accordance with the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until their respective
successors shall have been duly elected, designated or qualified, or until
their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the certificate
of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(d) If at any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
determine, in its sole discretion, or shall be advised, that any deeds, bills
of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or any other
actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of
record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest
in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of the
Company or the Purchaser acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to

Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on
behalf of either the Company or the Purchaser, all such deeds, bills of sale,
instruments of conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of each of such corporations or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights,
properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation or otherwise to carry out
this Agreement.

  

  

1.5 Closing and Effective Time of the Merger. The closing of the Merger (the
"Closing") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be
specified by the parties (the "Closing Date"), such date to be no later than
the second Business Day after satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions
set forth in Article 6 (other than those conditions that by their terms are to
be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or written waiver
(where permitted by applicable Law) of those conditions at the Closing), at
the offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 140 Scott Drive, Menlo Park, California
94025, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto. On the Closing Date, or on such other date as Parent and the
Company may agree to in writing, the Purchaser and the Company shall cause an
appropriate certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (the
"Certificate of Merger") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of State
of the State of Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL.
The Merger shall become effective at the date and time the Certificate of
Merger shall have been duly filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware or such other date and time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in the Certificate of Merger (such date and time, the "Effective
Time").

  

  

1.6 Merger Without Meeting of Stockholders. Notwithstanding the terms of
Section 5.2, if after the Acceptance Time and, if applicable, the expiration
of any "subsequent offering period" provided by the Purchaser in accordance
with this Agreement and the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser holds
of record at least 90% of the outstanding shares of each class of capital
stock of the Company entitled to vote on the approval of this Agreement under
applicable Law (the "Short Form Threshold"), the parties hereto agree to take
all necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become effective
as promptly as practicable without a meeting of stockholders of the Company in
accordance with the DGCL.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

  

  

1.7 Top-Up Option

  

  

(a) The Company hereby irrevocably grants to the Purchaser an option,
exercisable from and after the Acceptance Time only upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, to purchase from the Company, at a price
per share equal to the Offer Price, an aggregate number of newly-issued shares
of Company Common Stock (the "Top-Up Option Shares") equal to the number of
shares of Company Common Stock that, when added to the number of shares of
Company Common Stock owned by the Purchaser at the time of exercise of the
Top-Up Option, constitute one share more than 90% of the number of shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately after the issuance of all shares
of Company Common Stock subject to the Top-Up Option (the "Top-Up Option");
provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be exercisable unless,
immediately after such exercise and the issuance of shares of Company Common
Stock pursuant thereto, the Short Form Threshold would be reached (assuming
the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares); provided, further, that in no event
shall the Top-Up Option be exercisable for a number of shares of Company
Common Stock in excess of the Company's then total authorized and unissued
Shares. Upon the Purchaser's request, the Company shall cause its transfer
agent to certify in writing to the Purchaser the number of Shares issued and
outstanding as of immediately prior to the exercise of the Top-Up Option and
after giving effect to the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares. The Purchaser
shall pay the Company the aggregate par value of the Top-Up Option Shares in
cash and the balance of the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up
Option Shares by delivery of a non-negotiable and non-transferable promissory
note (the "Promissory Note"). The Promissory Note shall be full recourse
against the Purchaser, shall be guaranteed by Parent, shall bear interest at
the rate of interest per annum equal to the prime lending rate prevailing from
time to time during such period as published in The Wall Street Journal, shall
mature on the first anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such
Promissory Note and may be prepaid without premium or penalty. Parent, the
Purchaser and the Company acknowledge and agree that, in any appraisal
proceeding related to this Agreement, the fair value of the Shares subject to
the appraisal proceeding shall be determined in accordance with the DGCL
without regard to the exercise by Parent or the Purchaser of the Top-Up
Option, any Shares issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option or the Promissory
Note.

  

  

(b) Provided that no applicable Law shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Option Shares pursuant thereto, or
otherwise make such exercise or issuance illegal, the Purchaser may exercise
the Top-Up Option, in whole but not in part, after the Acceptance Time and
prior to the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the valid
termination of this Agreement (it being agreed and understood that for all
purposes of this Agreement and Annex I, any listing requirement of any
national securities exchange shall not be deemed to prohibit or make illegal
the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the issuance of the Top-Up Shares).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) To exercise the Top-Up Option, the Purchaser shall send to the Company a
written notice (a "Top-Up Exercise Notice") specifying the denominations of
the certificate or certificates evidencing the Top-Up Option Shares that the
Purchaser wishes to receive, and the place, time and date for the closing of
the purchase and sale pursuant to the Top-Up Option (the "Top-Up Closing").
The Company shall, promptly after receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice,
deliver a written notice to the Purchaser confirming the number of Top-Up
Option Shares and the aggregate purchase price therefor (the "Top-Up Notice
Receipt"). At the Top-Up Closing, the Purchaser shall deliver to the Company
the consideration required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Option
Shares in an aggregate amount equal to the purchase price specified in the
Top-Up Notice Receipt, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered
to the Purchaser a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Option
Shares. Such certificates shall include any legends that are required by
applicable Law. The Purchaser acknowledges that the Top-Up Option Shares shall
not be registered under the Securities Act, and shall be issued in reliance
upon an exemption for transactions not involving a public offering. The
Purchaser agrees that the Top-Up Option, and the Top-Up Option Shares are
being and shall be acquired by the Purchaser for the purpose of investment and
not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any distribution thereof
(within the meaning of the Securities Act).

  

  

ARTICLE 2

  

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES IN THE MERGER

  

  

2.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the Purchaser, the Company or the
holders of any of the following securities:

  

  

(a) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each Share issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(b) and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into
the right to receive the Offer Price (the "Merger Consideration"), payable to
the holder in cash, without interest, subject to any withholding of Taxes
required by applicable Law, upon surrender of the certificate formerly
representing such Shares in accordance with Section 2.2 (provisions with
respect to Restricted Shares are also addressed in Section 2.4(b)).

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock. All Shares that are
held in the treasury of the Company, and all Shares owned of record by Parent
or any of its direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiaries, including the
Purchaser, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, with no payment being
made with respect thereto.

  

  

(c) Purchaser Common Stock. Each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share, of the Purchaser (the "Purchaser Common Stock") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
newly and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.2 Payment for Securities; Surrender of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Purchaser shall
designate a reputable bank or trust company to act as the paying agent for
purposes of effecting the payment of the Merger Consideration in connection
with the Merger (the "Paying Agent"). At or promptly after the Effective Time,
the Purchaser shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent
the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders of Shares shall be
entitled at the Effective Time pursuant to this Agreement. Such funds shall be
invested by the Paying Agent as directed by the Purchaser, in its sole
discretion, pending payment thereof by the Paying Agent to the holders of the
Shares. Earnings from such investments shall be the sole and exclusive
property of the Purchaser, and no part of such earnings shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Shares.

  

  

(b) Procedures for Surrender. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each
holder of record of a certificate or certificates that represented Shares (the
"Certificates") or non-certificated Shares represented by book-entry ("Book-
Entry Shares"), in each case, which Shares were converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time pursuant to this
Agreement: (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and shall
otherwise be in such form and have such other provisions as the Purchaser or
the Paying Agent may reasonably specify and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for payment
of the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of Certificates and Book-Entry
Shares for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by the Purchaser, and upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal, duly executed and in proper form, with respect to such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, the holder of such Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration for each
Share formerly represented by such Certificates and for each Book-Entry Share.
Any Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be
cancelled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person
other than the Person in whose name any surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition precedent of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer, and the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any
transfer and other similar Taxes required by reason of the payment of the
Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate so surrendered and shall have established to the satisfaction of
the Surviving Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not
required to be paid. Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-
Entry Shares shall only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry
Shares are registered. Until surrendered as contemplated hereby, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in cash as contemplated by this Agreement, without interest thereon.

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Shares. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter
there shall be no further registration of transfers of Shares on the records
of the Company. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Shares except as otherwise
provided for herein or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Termination of Fund; Abandoned Property; No Liability. At any time
following six months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
be entitled to require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds (including
any interest received with respect thereto) made available to the Paying Agent
and not disbursed to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, and
thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws)
only as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration
payable upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and
compliance with the procedures in Section 2.2(b), without interest and subject
to any withholding of Taxes required by applicable Law. If, prior to six years
after the Effective Time (or otherwise immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Laws), any holder of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares has not
complied with the procedures in Section 2.2(b) to receive payment of the
Merger Consideration to which such holder would otherwise be entitled, the
payment in respect of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Surviving
Corporation nor the Paying Agent shall be liable to any holder of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

(e) Withholding Rights. Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and
the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts that Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other provision of applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made.

  

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event that any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Paying Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of
an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration
payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.1(a) hereof; provided,
however, that the Purchaser may, in its sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to the payment of such Merger Consideration, require the owners of
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as
it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

  

  

(g) Transfer Taxes. If payment of the Offer Price or the Merger Consideration
is to be made to any Person other than the registered owner of the applicable
Shares (or, in the case of the Offer, if certificates for Shares not tendered
or accepted for payment are to be registered in the name of any Person other
than the registered owner of such Shares, or tendered certificates for Shares
are registered in the name of any Person other than the Person signing the
Letter of Transmittal), the amount of any Transfer Taxes (whether imposed on
the registered owner or such other Person) payable on account of the transfer
will be deducted from the amount to be paid to such Person, unless
satisfactory evidence of the payment of such Transfer Taxes or exemption
therefrom is submitted to the Purchaser.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

2.3 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and in respect of which appraisal
rights shall have been perfected in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL in
connection with the Merger (collectively, "Dissenting Shares") shall be
converted into a right to receive that portion of the Merger Consideration
otherwise payable to the holder of such Dissenting Shares as provided in
Section 2.1(a), but shall instead be converted into the right to receive such
consideration as may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting
Shares pursuant to the DGCL. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to
the provisions of the DGCL, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of
such shares shall receive payment therefor in accordance with the DGCL (but
only after the value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the DGCL). In the event that any holder of Company
Common Stock fails to make an effective demand for payment or fails to perfect
its appraisal rights as to its shares of Company Common Stock or any
Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares, then
any such shares shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger
Consideration issuable pursuant to Section 2.1(a) in respect of such shares as
if such shares had never been Dissenting Shares, in accordance with and
following the satisfaction of the applicable requirements and conditions set
forth in Section 2.2. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in no
event more than two Business Days) of (i) any demand received by the Company
for appraisal of Company Common Stock (and shall give Parent the opportunity
to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand) or (ii) any notice of exercise by any holder of Company Common Stock
of appraisal rights in accordance with the DGCL. The Company agrees that,
except with Parent's prior written consent, it shall not voluntarily make any
payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demand for appraisal or exercise of appraisal rights.

  

  

2.4 Treatment of Options; Restricted Stock; Warrants.

  

  

(a) Treatment of Options.

  

  

(i) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised
option to purchase Shares (each, a "Company Option") that is vested and was
granted under any stock option plan of the Company or any other equity plan or
other Contract (collectively, the "Company Stock Option Plans"), shall be
cancelled and, in exchange therefor, each former holder of any such cancelled
Company Option shall be entitled to receive from the Company, in consideration
of the cancellation of such Company Option and in settlement therefor, a
payment in cash (subject to all applicable withholding or other Taxes required
by applicable Law) of an amount equal to the product of (i) the total number
of vested Shares subject to such Company Option immediately prior to such
cancellation and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share subject to such Company Option immediately prior to
such cancellation (such amounts payable hereunder being referred to as the
"Option Payments"), with the understanding that, for purposes of this clause,
if there are different exercise prices for different Company Options held by
the same holder, separate calculations shall be made for each exercise price.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, to the extent
the per share exercise price for the shares of Company Common Stock that would
have been issuable upon exercise of such Company Option is greater than the
Offer Price, the Company Option shall be terminated and cancelled at the
Effective Time and no Option Payment shall be made. From and after the
Effective Time, any such cancelled Company Option shall no longer be
exercisable by the former holder thereof, but shall only entitle such holder
to the payment of the Option Payment, if any. The Option Payments shall be
paid by Parent or the Surviving Corporation as soon as practicable following
the Effective Time, without interest. Each Company Option that is unvested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
accelerated vesting that occurs in connection with the Offer or the Merger,
including, without limitation, any accelerated vesting that occurs pursuant to
Section 2.4(a)(iii)) and is held by an individual who, after the Effective
Time, is not an "employee" of Parent or an affiliate of Parent within the
meaning of General Instruction A(1)(a)(1) of Form S-8, shall be cancelled as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time without payment of any Merger
Consideration or other amount with respect thereto or in settlement therefor,
and the Company shall take all necessary action to provide for such
cancellation and treatment.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall assume, in a manner
that complies in all material respects with Sections 409A and 424(a) of the
Code, each unvested Company Option that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by an individual who, after the Effective Time, is
an "employee" of Parent or an affiliate of Parent within the meaning of
General Instruction A(1)(a)(1) of Form S-8 (each, an "Assumed Company Option")
and each Company Stock Option Plan pursuant to which any Assumed Company
Option has been granted (as to such Assumed Company Options, but not as to the
authority to grant new awards after the Effective Time). Each Assumed Company
Option shall thereafter be exercisable, on substantially the same terms and
conditions as in effect at the Effective Time, for such number of shares of
Parent Common Stock that equals the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time multiplied by the
Equity Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole number). The exercise
price per share of each such Assumed Company Option shall be equal to the
exercise price per share set forth at the Effective Time in the option
agreement for such Company Option divided by the Equity Exchange Ratio
(rounded up to the next whole cent). The Company and the administrator of the
applicable Company Stock Option Plan(s) shall each use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Company Stock Option Plan(s) and all Assumed
Company Options to be assumed by Parent on the terms and conditions set forth
in this Section 2.4(a)(ii). As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall make available to holders of Assumed Company Options a statement
setting forth such holders' rights pursuant to the Assumed Company Options,
including the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such
Assumed Company Option, the exercise price of each such Assumed Company
Option.

  

  

(iii) The parties hereby acknowledge that the Company shall, prior to the
Acceptance Time, take all necessary action to provide that each unvested
Company Option that is outstanding under the Company's Amended and Restated
2007 Equity Incentive Plan or the Company's Amended and Restated 2007
Incentive Stock and Award Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time and is
held by an individual who is a non-employee director of the Company or an
employee of the Company as of immediately prior to the Effective Time who is
not offered employment by Parent or an affiliate of Parent on or prior to the
Effective Time shall vest in full immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iv) The Company shall, prior to the Acceptance Time, take any and all action
as may be necessary to amend the Company's 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, as
amended (the "2011 Stock Option Plan"), to provide that such plan shall not
automatically terminate upon the occurrence of a "Change in Control" (as
defined in the 2011 Stock Option Plan).

  

  

(v) In no event shall the vesting of a Company Option that is held by a
Continuing Employee or an employee who resigns his or her employment with the
Company or revokes his or her offer acceptance with Parent or an affiliate of
Parent, in each case, on or prior to the Effective Time accelerate in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, such
resignation or such revocation.

  

  

(vi) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take (or cause to be
taken) any and all action, and shall obtain all such consents, as may be
necessary to effect the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.4(a).

  

  

(vii) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parent
Common Stock issuable upon vesting of the Assumed Company Options to be
registered with the SEC on Form S-8 no later than 90 days following the
Effective Time, will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of such registration statement for so long as such Assumed
Company Options remain outstanding and will maintain a sufficient number of
reserved shares of Parent Common Stock for issuance upon exercise or vesting,
as applicable, thereof.

  

  

(b) Treatment of Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units.

  

  

(i) Each Share that, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, is subject
to a risk of forfeiture, a right of repurchase in favor of the Company, or to
restrictions on transfers under the applicable award agreement or Benefit
Plan, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time under any
Contract, instrument or plan set forth in Section 3.2(b) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (each, a "Restricted Share") shall be converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in
Section 2.1(a), such Merger Consideration to be paid to the holder of such
Restricted Share in accordance with the vesting schedule applicable to such
Restricted Share, in each case subject to all applicable withholding or other
Taxes required by applicable Law. The Company shall obtain, prior to the
Closing, the consent from each holder of a Restricted Share to the amendment
of the terms governing such Restricted Share to permit the treatment set forth
in this Section 2.4(b)(i) (unless such consent is not required under the terms
of the applicable Contract, instrument or plan).

  

  

(ii) At the Effective Time, each award of restricted stock units with respect
to Company Common Stock ("Company RSUs") shall be assumed by Parent and shall
be converted into a new award of Parent restricted stock units ("Assumed
RSUs") covering a number of shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product
of (rounded down to the next whole number) (i) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock covered by the such Company RSU award immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the Equity Exchange Ratio. Each Assumed RSU
shall otherwise continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and
conditions (including the vesting arrangements and other terms and conditions
set forth in the applicable Company Stock Options Plan and the applicable
restricted stock unit or other Contract) as are in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time, except that Parent shall have any and all amendment and
administrative authority with respect to such Assumed RSUs (subject, in the
case of any amendment, to any required consent of the affected holder of such
Assumed RSUs).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(iii) The parties hereby acknowledge that the Company shall, prior to the
Acceptance Time, take all necessary action to provide that each unvested
Restricted Share and Company RSU that is outstanding under the Company's
Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan or the Company's Amended and
Restated 2007 Incentive Stock and Award Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time and is held by an individual who is a non-employee director of
the Company or an employee of the Company as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time who is not offered employment by Parent or an affiliate of
Parent on or prior to the Effective Time shall vest in full immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

  

  

(iv) In no event shall the vesting or lapse of risk of forfeiture, right of
repurchase in favor of the Company or restrictions on transfers on Restricted
Shares or Company RSUs that are held by a Continuing Employee or an employee
who resigns his or her employment with the Company or revokes his or her offer
acceptance with Parent or an affiliate of Parent, in each case, on or prior to
the Effective Time accelerate in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, such resignation or such revocation.

  

  

(v) Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause Parent Common
Stock issuable upon vesting of the Assumed RSUs to be registered with the SEC
no later than 90 days following the Effective Time, will exercise commercially
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration
statement for so long as such Assumed RSUs remain outstanding and will
maintain a sufficient number of reserved shares of Parent Common Stock for
issuance upon exercise or vesting, as applicable, thereof.

  

  

(c) Treatment of Company Warrants.

  

  

(i) At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that has not otherwise been
exercised or expired shall be terminated immediately upon the Effective Time.
Neither the Surviving Corporation nor Parent shall assume any Company Warrant
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not
then exercisable. Following the Effective Time, no Company Warrant shall
remain outstanding and, except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no
holder of a Company Warrant shall have the right to receive any consideration
from the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation upon the exercise or
conversion of such Company Warrant or otherwise in respect thereof.

  

  

(ii) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take (or cause to be
taken) any and all action, and shall obtain all such consents, as may be
necessary to cause the holders of all Company Warrants that have not otherwise
been exercised or expired prior to the Effective Time to agree to the
treatment set forth in this Section 2.4(c) (including, without limitation,
providing any notices required under the Contracts relating to such Company
Warrants regarding the transaction contemplated by this Agreement).

good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all requisite corporate or organizational, as the case

each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified to do business and is in good
standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its

standing, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

of each Company Subsidiary. The Company is not in violation of the Company
Charter or Company Bylaws, and the Company Subsidiaries are not in violation
of their respective organizational or governing documents.

its terms, be treated as set forth in Section 2.4. Section 3.2(b)(iv) of the

necessary number of votes, and the award agreement governing such grant was
duly executed and delivered by each party thereto. Each such grant was made in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Option Plan, the
Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws, including the rules of NASDAQ. The
per share exercise price of each Company Option was at least equal to the fair
market value of a share of Company Common Stock on the applicable Grant Date
(as determined in accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock
Option Plan and Sections 409A and 422 of the Code), and each such grant was
properly accounted for in accordance with GAAP in the financial statements
(including the related notes) of the Company and disclosed in the Company SEC
Documents in accordance with the Exchange Act and all other applicable Laws.
The Company has not granted, and there is not, and has not been, any Company
policy or practice to grant, Company Options prior to, or otherwise coordinate
the grant of Company Options with, the release or other public announcement of
material information regarding the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries
or any of their financial results or prospects.

  

  

(d) Except for the Company Options and the Company Warrants set forth in
Section 3.2(b), as of October 31, 2011, there were no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements, arrangements or commitments of any character (i)
relating, convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock of any other
Equity Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) obligating
the Company or any Company Subsidiary to issue, acquire or sell any Equity
Interests of the Company or any Company Subsidiary. Since the close of
business on December 31, 2010, the Company has not issued any shares of its

with respect to, any shares of Company Common Stock or other Equity Interests
in the Company or any Company Subsidiary.

(f) Section 3.2(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth, for each
Company Subsidiary, as applicable: (i) its authorized capital stock or other

Laws), and all of such shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid, nonassessable and
free of preemptive rights. Except for Equity Interests in the Company

to provide funds to, or to make any investment (in the form of a loan, capital
contribution or otherwise) in, any Company Subsidiary or any other Person.
Since the close of business on December 31, 2010, no Company Subsidiary has
issued any shares of capital stock or other Equity Interests.

  

  

3.3 Authority.

  

  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and corporate authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and

transactions contemplated hereby, including the Offer, the exercise of the
Top-Up Option and the Merger, have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no stockholder votes or consents are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby (other
than, with respect to the Merger, (i) the Company Stockholder Approval, if

their Shares to the Purchaser in the Offer and, to the extent applicable,
adopt this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly authorized and validly
executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming due authorization,
execution and delivery by Parent and the Purchaser, constitutes a legally
valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company
in accordance with its terms (except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization,
moratorium and other similar Laws affecting creditors' rights generally and
subject to the effect of general principles of equity, whether considered in a

transaction contemplated by this Agreement. No other "moratorium," "fair
price," "business combination," "combinations with interested stockholders,"
"control share acquisition" or similar provision of any state anti-takeover
Law or other Law that purports to limit or restrict business combinations or

or at the Effective Time will be, applicable to the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the Top-Up Option,
including the acquisition of Shares pursuant thereto, the Tender Agreements or
any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(c) The Company is not a party to any stockholder rights plan or "poison pill"

Agreement will (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both): (a) subject
to obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval, if required, conflict with or
violate any provision of the Company Charter or Company Bylaws or any
equivalent organizational or governing documents of any Company Subsidiary,
(b) assuming that all consents, approvals, authorizations and permits
described in Section 3.3 have been obtained and all filings and notifications
described in Section 3.5 have been made and any waiting periods thereunder
have terminated or expired, conflict with or violate any Law applicable to the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or
assets or (c) require any consent or approval under, violate, conflict with,
result in any breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a
change of control or default under, or result in termination or give to others
any right of termination, vesting, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of,
or result in the creation of a Lien upon any of the respective properties or
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any Contract,
Company Permit or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary is a party or by which they or any of their respective
properties or assets may be bound or affected, except, with respect to clauses
(b) and (c), for any such conflicts, violations, consents, breaches, losses,
changes of control, defaults, other occurrences or Liens which, individually
or in the aggregate, have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

3.5 Required Filings and Consents. Assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of Parent and the Purchaser in Section 4.4,
none of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by the
Company, the acceptance for payment or acquisition of Shares pursuant to the
Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option, the consummation by the Company of
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or the
Company's compliance with any of the provisions of this Agreement will require
(with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) any consent, approval,
authorization or permit of, or filing or registration with or notification to,
any Governmental Entity or any other Person, other than (a) the filing of the
Certificate of Merger as required by the DGCL, (b) the receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, if applicable, (c) compliance with the applicable

approvals, authorizations or permits of, or to make such filings,
registrations with or notifications to any Governmental Entity or any other
Person, individually or in the aggregate, has not had a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

(a) The Company and each Company Subsidiary holds all licenses, permits,
certificates, variances, exemptions, approvals and registrations of any
Governmental Entity required by applicable Law or Order for the Company and
each Company Subsidiary to own, lease and operate its properties and assets,
and to conduct its business as currently conducted (the "Company Permits"),
except where the failure to have any Company Permits, individually or in the
aggregate, has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.6(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate and complete list of the
Company Permits. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is and since January

the failure to be in compliance with any Company Permits, or the failure of
any Company Permits to be valid or in full force and effect, individually or
in the aggregate, has not had a Company Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension, modification, revocation or cancellation of any of the Company
Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for
any such actions that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is or since January 1, 2008
has been in conflict with, default under or violation of, or is being or since

Subsidiary or by which any property or asset of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is bound or affected, except for any conflicts, defaults,
violations, investigations or charges that, individually or in the aggregate,
have not had a Company Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review by
any Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any Company Subsidiary
is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, except for such
investigations or reviews, the outcomes of which if determined adversely to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, individually or in the aggregate, have
not had a Company Material Adverse Effect.

be filed or furnished by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as
the case may be, together with all certifications required pursuant to the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Sarbanes-Oxley Act") (such documents and any
other documents filed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary with the SEC,
as have been supplemented, modified or amended since the time of filing,
collectively, the "Company SEC Documents"). As of their respective filing
dates the Company SEC Documents (i) did not (or with respect to Company SEC

therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii) complied

will be, as the case may be, prepared from, are in accordance with, and
accurately reflect the books and records of the Company and the consolidated
Company Subsidiaries in all material respects, (B) have been or will be, as
the case may be, prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent

(a) The Company has designed and maintains a system of internal controls over
financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the
Exchange Act) sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. The Company (i) has designed and maintains disclosure controls

Act) to ensure that material information required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to the
Company's management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and (ii) has disclosed to the Company's auditors and the
audit committee of the Company Board (and made summaries of such disclosures
available to Parent) (A) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses
in the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that

Company's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's
internal controls over financial reporting. The Company is in compliance in
all material respects with all effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

the Company, any director, officer, auditor, accountant or representative of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary has received or otherwise had or

attorney representing the Company or any Company Subsidiary has reported
evidence of a material violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty
or similar violation by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any of their
respective officers, directors, employees or agents, to the current Company
Board or any committee thereof or to any current director or executive officer
of the Company.

  

  

(c) To the knowledge of the Company, no employee of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary has provided or is providing information to any Law enforcement
agency regarding the commission or possible commission of any crime or the
violation or possible violation of any applicable legal requirements of the
type described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any director, officer, employee, contractor,
subcontractor or agent of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, has
discharged, demoted, suspended, threatened, harassed or in any other manner
discriminated against an employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act of such
employee described in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

Intellectual Property.

  

  

(d) None of the Company-Owned Intellectual Property is involved in or subject
to any pending or threatened Action regarding ownership, use, invalidity or
enforceability, including any interference, reexamination, cancellation, or
opposition proceeding. There are no facts, circumstances, or information that

the Company-Owned Intellectual Property invalid or unenforceable or (ii)
adversely affect, limit, restrict, impair, or impede the ability of the
Surviving Corporation to use and practice the Company Intellectual Property
upon the Closing in the same or similar manner as currently used and practiced

knowledge of the Company, the Company-Owned Intellectual Property is

into the public domain.

  

  

(e) Section 3.17(e)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a complete
and accurate list of all Contracts to which the Company or any Company

sue, release, immunity or other right with respect to Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights ("Outbound Intellectual Property Contracts"),
other than nondisclosure agreements, end user license agreements, and terms of
use entered into in the ordinary course of business on Company's or a Company
Subsidiary's applicable standard form agreement without material changes
("Unscheduled Outbound IP Contracts"). Section 3.17(e)(ii) of the Company

which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party, or by which the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is otherwise bound under which any Third

Open Source) inbound Software licenses generally commercially available on
commercially reasonable terms with annual license fees under $10,000 in the
aggregate that do not relate to Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property
Rights incorporated into any Company Offering ("Unscheduled Inbound IP

(f) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will violate or result in the breach, material modification, cancellation,

Company's (or the Company Subsidiary's, as the case may be) rights under all
Company Intellectual Property Contracts (and will have the same rights with
respect to the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights of Third
Parties included in the Company Intellectual Property) to the same extent the
Company (or the Company Subsidiary, as the case may be) would have had, and
been able to exercise, had the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not
occurred, without payment of any additional amounts or consideration other
than ongoing fees, royalties or payments that the Company (or the Company
Subsidiary, as the case may be) would have been required to pay anyway even if
such transactions had not occurred.

  

  

(g) Neither this Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor any Contracts to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
a party (including the assignment (if any) to the Surviving Corporation upon
or at any time following Closing, by operation of law or otherwise, of any
such Contracts), will result in (i) any Third Party being granted the right to
exercise any rights to or access to, or the placement in or release from
escrow, any Intellectual Property, (ii) violation, breach, material
modification, cancellation, termination or suspension of, or acceleration of
any payments under, the Company Intellectual Property Contracts or (iii)
Parent or any of its affiliates or the Surviving Corporation (x) granting or
being required to grant to any Third Party any license, covenant not to sue,
immunity or other right with respect to any Intellectual Property or
Intellectual Property Rights, (y) being bound by, or subject to, any non-
compete or other restriction on the operation or scope of their respective
businesses or (z) being obligated to pay any amounts, or offer discounts to
any Person, except, with respect to Surviving Corporation in each case
(x)-(z), to the same extent that the Company or any Company Subsidiary would
have been so obligated even if such transactions had not occurred.

  

  

(h) The Company or a Company Subsidiary solely and exclusively owns all right,
title and interest in and to (including the sole right to enforce) the
Company-Owned Intellectual Property, free and clear of any and all Liens, and

other Company Intellectual Property, to any Third Party, except pursuant to an
Outbound Intellectual Property Contract listed in Section 3.17(e)(i) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or an Unscheduled Outbound IP Contract or (ii)
exclusively licensed any such Company-Owned Intellectual Property, or any
other Company Intellectual Property, to any Third Party. The Company or a
Company Subsidiary is listed in the records of the appropriate Governmental
Entity as the sole owner of each item of Registered Company Intellectual
Property. All Licensed Company Intellectual Property is licensed by the
Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant to a valid Inbound Intellectual
Property Contract listed in Section 3.17(e)(i) for use in the manner in which
it is currently used by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. All Company

(i) The Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights included in the
Company-Owned Intellectual Property and Licensed Company Intellectual Property
include all of the Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights that
are necessary to enable the Surviving Corporation to conduct the business of
the Company and any Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and,
immediately following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation will own or have
(pursuant to the Inbound Intellectual Property Contracts) the same rights that
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries had immediately prior to the Closing
with respect to such Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights.

  

  

(j) The Company and each Company Subsidiary has taken steps consistent with
industry standards, and in any event no less than reasonable steps, to
safeguard and maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of, and its proprietary
rights in, all Trade Secrets provided by Third Parties for which the Company
has an obligation of confidentiality and any other Trade Secrets that are
included in the Company Intellectual Property. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary has authorized the disclosure of any Trade Secret included
in the Company Intellectual Property, nor has any such Trade Secret been
disclosed to a Third Party by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, in each
case other than pursuant to a valid and enforceable confidentiality agreement
with respect thereto. To the knowledge of Company, no Person has
misappropriated, made any unauthorized disclosure of, or breached its
confidentiality obligations with respect to any Trade Secret included in the
Company Intellectual Property.

Subsidiary applicable employment or contractor agreements, non-disclosure
agreements, and assignment agreements that assign to the Company or the
Company Subsidiary all Intellectual Property and Intellectual Property Rights
developed in connection with such Person's work for the Company or the Company
Subsidiary, which applicable documents contain contractual terms reasonably
protective of for the Trade Secrets of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries. To the knowledge of the Company, no Company Personnel is in
breach of any such agreement. No Company Personnel has any ownership, license,
or other right in any Company-Owned Intellectual Property, and neither the
Company nor any Company Subsidiary owes any royalties, license fees or other
amounts to any Company Personnel with respect to any Company-Owned
Intellectual Property.

without authorization, or otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Rights
of any Third Party and (ii) does not constitute unfair competition or trade
practices under the Laws of any relevant jurisdiction.

  

  

(n) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any written

operations, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and other
facilities of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and to the books and
records thereof (including Tax Returns) and (ii) furnish promptly such
information concerning the business, properties, offices and other facilities,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, employees, officers and other aspects of the
Company and each Company Subsidiary as Parent or the Parent Representatives
may reasonably request. No investigation conducted pursuant to this Section
5.3(a) shall affect or be deemed to modify or limit any representation or
warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

  

  

(b) With respect to the information disclosed pursuant to Section 5.3(a),
Parent shall comply with, and shall cause the Parent Representatives to comply
with, all of its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, dated July

Agreement"), paragraph 11 of which is hereby amended in its entirety to read
as follows:

  

  

 

"11. Term. This Agreement between the parties shall expire on the earlier of
(a) the Closing of that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger among Yahoo!
Inc., Innsbruck Acquisition Corp. and interclick, inc., dated as of October
31, 2011 (the "Merger Agreement") and (b) one year from the date of the Merger
Agreement, provided that the terms of paragraph 6 shall survive the
termination or expiration of this Agreement, and provided further that such
expiration shall not relieve any party for liability for breach of this
Agreement occurring before such expiration."

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.4 No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation.

  

  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4, effective on the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall, and shall cause each Company Subsidiary
and Company Representative to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any existing solicitation, encouragement, discussion or negotiation
with any Third Party (other than Parent) that may be ongoing with respect to a
Competing Proposal and (ii) request any such Third Party to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4, the Company shall not,
and shall cause each Company Subsidiary and Company Representative not to, at
all times from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
Article 7, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate, or knowingly
facilitate or knowingly encourage (including by providing non-public
information) any inquiry, discussion, offer or request that constitutes, or
would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal, (ii) engage in,
enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish any non-public information relating to the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries to, or afford access to the books
or records or officers of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries to, any
Third Party relating to any Competing Proposal or any proposal or offer that
would reasonably be expected to lead to a Competing Proposal, (iii) approve,
endorse, recommend, execute or enter into, or publicly propose to approve,
endorse, recommend, execute or enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar definitive Contract (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement) with respect to any Competing Proposal (an "Alternative Acquisition
Agreement"), (iv) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover
Statute (including Section 203 of the DGCL) or any applicable anti-takeover
provision in the Company's organizational documents inapplicable to any
transactions contemplated by a Competing Proposal, (v) terminate, amend,
release, modify or fail to enforce any provision of, or grant any permission,
waiver or request under, any standstill, confidentiality or similar Contract
entered into by the Company in respect of or in contemplation of a Competing
Proposal (other than to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with its financial and legal advisors, that failure to take
any of such actions under this Section 5.4(b)(v) would be inconsistent with
the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law and is necessary to
facilitate a Competing Proposal in compliance with this Section 5.4) or (vi)
propose, resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.4(b), if,
at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, (i) the Company has received an
unsolicited bona fide written Competing Proposal from a Third Party that did
not arise out of any breach of this Section 5.4, (ii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, that such Competing Proposal constitutes, or would reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (iii) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors'
fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish non-
public information to such Third Party making the Competing Proposal and (y)
engage in discussions or negotiations with such Third Party with respect to
the Competing Proposal; provided, however, that (A) prior to so furnishing
such information, the Company receives from the Third Party an executed
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) any material non-public
information concerning the Company or the Company Subsidiaries provided or
made available to any Third Party shall, to the extent not previously provided
or made available to Parent or the Purchaser, be provided or made available to
Parent or the Purchaser as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event
later than 24 hours after it is provided or made available to such Third
Party). Prior to taking any of the actions referred to in this Section 5.4(c),
the Company shall notify Parent and the Purchaser orally and in writing that
it proposes to furnish non-public information and/or enter into discussions or
negotiations as provided in this Section 5.4(c), together with an unredacted
copy of the Competing Proposal submitted by such Third Party.

  

  

(d) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 5.4(d), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or
modify, or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify, in a
manner adverse to Parent or the Purchaser, the Company Board Recommendation,
(ii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Schedule 14D-9 or
the Proxy Statement, (iii) if a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of
capital stock of the Company that constitutes a Competing Proposal is
commenced, fail to publicly recommend against acceptance of such tender offer
or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the stockholders of the Company, which shall
constitute a failure to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or
exchange offer) within 10 Business Days after commencement thereof or fail to
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within four Business Days after
Parent so requests in writing, (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve or recommend, any Competing Proposal made or
received after the date of this Agreement (any of the actions described in
clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section 5.4(d), an "Adverse Recommendation
Change") or (v) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter
into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Acceptance
Time, the Company Board shall be permitted to effect any Adverse
Recommendation Change described in clause (i) of such definition or otherwise
terminate this Agreement to concurrently enter into a definitive Alternative
Acquisition Agreement, in each case solely with respect to a Superior
Proposal, subject in each case to compliance with Section 5.4(e) and the
concurrent payment of any amount owed Parent pursuant to Section 7.2, if the
Company Board (A) has received a bona fide written Competing Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
and legal advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, after having complied
with, and giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by
Parent and the Purchaser pursuant to Section 5.4(e) and (B) determines in good
faith, after consultation with its legal advisors, that failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal unless (i) the Company has not breached this Section 5.4 in
any respect as relates to such Superior Proposal, (ii) the Company has
provided written notice (a "Notice of Superior Proposal") to Parent and the
Purchaser that the Company intends to take such action, which notice includes
an unredacted copy of the Superior Proposal that is the basis of such action
(including the identity of the Third Party making the Superior Proposal) and
copies of all relevant documents relating to such Superior Proposal, (iii)
during the four Business Days period following Parent's and the Purchaser's
receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause
the Company Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and the Purchaser in
good faith (to the extent Parent and the Purchaser desire to negotiate) to
make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that
such Superior Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal and (iv)
following the end of the four Business Days period, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent and the Purchaser in response to the Notice of Superior
Proposal or otherwise, that the Superior Proposal giving rise to the Notice of
Superior Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any amendment
to the financial terms or any other material amendment of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and the Company shall
be required to comply again with the requirements of this Section 5.4(e);
provided, however, that for purposes of this sentence, references to the four
Business Days period above shall be deemed to be references to a two Business
Days period.

  

  

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours), notify Parent in the event that the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative receives (i) any
Competing Proposal or indication by any Person that it is considering making a
Competing Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information relating to
the Company or any Company Subsidiary other than requests for information in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to
a Competing Proposal or (iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or
negotiations regarding any Competing Proposal. In connection with such notice,
the Company shall indicate the identity of such Person or group of Persons and
shall provide a copy of such Competing Proposal, indication, inquiry or
request (or, where no such copy is available, a reasonably detailed
description of such Competing Proposal, indication, inquiry or request),
including any modifications thereto. Thereafter, the Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed (orally and in writing) on a current basis (and in any
event at Parent's request and otherwise no later than 24 hours after the
occurrence of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations)
of the status of any Competing Proposal, indication, inquiry or request
(including the terms and conditions thereof and of any modification thereto),
and any material developments, discussions and negotiations, including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the
Company Board, directly or indirectly through the Company Representatives,
from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with
respect to a tender or exchange offer by a Third Party pursuant to Rule 14d-9
or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any "stop, look and
listen" communication to the Company's stockholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act if the Company Board has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its legal advisors, that the failure to do so would
breach the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided,
however, that any disclosures permitted under Section 5.4(g)(i) that is not an
express rejection of any applicable Competing Proposal or an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board's recommendation in favor of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed an Adverse
Recommendation Change.

  

  

(h) The Company agrees that any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.4 by any of the Company Representatives shall be deemed to be a
material breach of this Agreement (including this Section 5.4) by the Company.

  

  

(i) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Competing Proposal" shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any proposal or offer from a Third Party relating to (A) a
merger, reorganization, sale of assets, share exchange, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, dissolution, liquidation, joint
venture or similar transaction involving the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the aggregate, constitute 20% or
more of the consolidated assets of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries,
as determined on a book-value or fair-market-value basis, (B) the acquisition
or license (whether by merger, consolidation, equity investment, joint venture
or otherwise) by any Person of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-
market-value basis, (C) the purchase or acquisition, in any manner, directly
or indirectly, by any Person of 20% or more of the issued and outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock or any other Equity Interests in the Company,
(D) any purchase, acquisition, tender offer or exchange offer that, if
consummated, would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of the
shares of Company Common Stock or any other Equity Interests of the Company or
any of the Company Subsidiaries whose assets, individually or in the
aggregate, constitute 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, as determined on a book-value or fair-market-
value basis or (E) any combination of the foregoing.

  

  

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited bona fide written Competing
Proposal (except the references therein to "20%" shall be replaced by "85%")
made by a Third Party which was not solicited by the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any Company Representative and which, in the good faith judgment
of the Company Board, after consultation with its financial and legal
advisors, taking into account the various legal, financial and regulatory
aspects of the Competing Proposal, including the financing terms thereof, and
the Third Party making such Competing Proposal, (A) if accepted, is reasonably
likely to be consummated and (B) if consummated would result in a transaction
that is more favorable to the Company's stockholders, from a financial point
of view, than the Offer and the Merger (after giving effect to all adjustments
to the terms thereof which may be offered by Parent, including pursuant to
Section 5.4(e)).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.5 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings.

  

  

(a) The Company and Parent shall use (and cause their respective Subsidiaries
to use) their commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly
as practicable, including those matters set forth on Section 5.5(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, (ii) obtain from any Governmental Entities any
consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals, authorizations or orders
required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, or to avoid any Action or Order by any Governmental Entity, in
connection with the authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement
and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including
without limitation the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option and the Merger
and (iii) promptly make all necessary filings, and thereafter make any other
required submissions, and pay any fees due in connection therewith, with
respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option and the Merger
required under (A) the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and any other
applicable securities Laws, (B) the HSR Act and any other applicable
competition Laws and (C) any other applicable Law, if any; provided, that the
Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other in all respects in
connection with (x) preparing and filing the Offer Documents, the Schedule
14D-9, the Proxy Statement and any other filings made or required to be made
with the SEC in connection with the Offer or the Merger and the transactions
contemplated thereby, (y) making an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act
as set forth in Section 5.5(d) and determining whether any other action by or
in respect of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity is required, in
connection with the consummation of the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up
Option or the Merger and (z) seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or
waivers or timely making any such filings. The Company and Parent shall
furnish to each other all information required for any application or other
filing under any applicable Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. The Company and Parent may, as each deems
advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any competitively sensitive
material provided to the other pursuant to this Section 5.5 as "Outside
Counsel Only Material." Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.5, materials provided to the other party or its counsel may be
redacted to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and any
Company Subsidiaries.

  

  

(b) The Company and Parent shall give (or shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to give) any notices to Third Parties, and use, and cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use, their commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any Third Party consents (i) necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) required to
be disclosed in the Company Disclosure Schedule or (iii) required to prevent a
Company Material Adverse Effect from occurring prior to or after the Effective
Time; provided, however, that the Company and Parent shall coordinate and
cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be obtained from parties to any Company Material Contracts in
connection with consummation of the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option
or the Merger and seeking any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. In
the event that either party shall fail to obtain any Third Party consent
described in the first sentence of this Section 5.5(b), such party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts, and shall take any such actions reasonably
requested by the other party hereto, to minimize any adverse effect upon the
Company and Parent, their respective Subsidiaries, and their respective
businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after
the consummation of the Offer or the Effective Time, from the failure to
obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any
Person with respect to the Offer, the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the
Merger, (i) without the prior written consent of Parent, none of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose
approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make
any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person
and (ii) neither Parent nor the Purchaser shall be required to pay or commit
to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or
other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other
obligation.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5,
each party hereto shall: (i) give the other parties prompt notice of any
request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action, actual or threatened, by
or before the United States Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the United
States Department of Justice ("DOJ") or any other applicable Governmental
Entity or any Third Party with respect to the Offer, the exercise of the Top-
Up Option, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) keep the other parties informed as to the status of any such
request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action and (iii) promptly inform
the other parties of any communication to or from any Governmental Entity or
any Third Party regarding the Offer, the Top-Up Option or the Merger. Each
party hereto will (i) use its commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any
such request, inquiry, objection, charge or other Action, and to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall
include litigating or contesting any such Action or Order to a final, non-
appealable decision, (subject in all respects to the provisions regarding the
Outside Date set forth in Section 1.1(e) and Section 7.1(k)) so as to permit
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii)
consult and cooperate with the other parties and consider in good faith the
views of the other parties in connection with any filing, analysis,
appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, opinion or proposal
made or submitted in connection with the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (such
cooperation shall include consultation with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Entity
or, in connection with any Action by a Third Party, with any other Person, and
to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other applicable
Governmental Entity or other Person, providing the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences).

  

  

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of anything contained in this Section 5.5,
each party hereto agrees to: (i) on or before the date of the commencement of
the Offer, make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act (including seeking early termination of the waiting
period under the HSR Act) with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act by the FTC or the DOJ, which shall include using commercially
reasonable efforts to certify compliance with any "second request" for
additional information or documentary material from the FTC or DOJ pursuant to
the HSR Act within four months after receipt of such second request and to
produce documents on a rolling basis, and (iii) use its commercially
reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary,
proper or advisable consistent with this Section 5.5 to cause the expiration
or termination of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required
authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act as soon as practicable.
Parent and the Company shall jointly direct the antitrust defense of the
Offer, the Merger or any other transactions contemplated thereby, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other Third Party relating to
the Offer, the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable competition Law,
subject to the provisions of this Section 5.5. The parties shall use their
commercially reasonable efforts to provide full and effective support of each
other in all material respects in all such negotiations and other discussions
or actions in order to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting periods or receipt of required authorizations. The Company shall not
make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in
negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Entity with respect to any
proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling, except
as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. Each party hereto shall
bear its own Expenses in connection with any such filings and actions
contemplated pursuant to this Section 5.5(d). None of Parent, the Purchaser or
the Company shall commit to or agree with any Governmental Entity to stay,
toll or extend any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or applicable
competition Laws, without the prior written consent of the other parties.

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

60  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement
(but subject in all respects to Section 5.1), (i) nothing in this Section 5.5
shall limit a party's right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Article 7
hereof and (ii) nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Parent, the Purchaser
or any of their respective affiliates to agree to (and none of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary shall, without the prior written consent of Parent):
(A) sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of its
respective business, assets or properties, or conduct its business in a
specified manner, (B) pay any amounts (other than the payment of filing fees
and expenses and fees of counsel), or grant any counterparty to any Contract
any material accommodation, (C) limit in any manner whatsoever the ability of
such entities to conduct, own, operate or control any of their respective
businesses, assets or properties or of the businesses, properties or assets of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries or (D) waive any of the conditions
set forth in Annex I of this Agreement.

  

  

5.6 Certain Notices. From and after the date of this Agreement until the
Effective Time, each party hereto shall promptly notify the other party hereto
of (a) the occurrence, or non-occurrence, of any event that would reasonably
be likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement not
to be satisfied or (b) the failure of the Company or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Offer, the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by
this Agreement not to be satisfied; provided, however, that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 5.6 shall not cure any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or
otherwise limit or affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

5.7 Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby shall be a joint release mutually agreed upon by the Company and
Parent. Thereafter, none of the parties shall (and each of the parties shall
cause its representatives and affiliates, if applicable, not to) issue any
press release or make any public announcement concerning this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written consent of (a) the Company, in the event the
disclosing party is Parent, the Purchaser, any of its affiliates or any Parent
Representative, or (b) Parent, in the event the disclosing party is the
Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Company Representative, in each case,
with such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld;
provided, however, that (i) if a party determines, based upon advice of
counsel, that a press release or public announcement is required by applicable
Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable stock exchange, such party
may make such press release or public announcement, in which case the
disclosing party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide the
other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, (ii) this Section 5.7 shall terminate upon a Adverse
Recommendation Change and (iii) each of the parties may make public statements
in response to specific questions by the press, analysts, investors or those
attending industry conferences or financial analyst conference calls, so long
as any such statements are not materially inconsistent with previous press
releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by Parent and
the Company and do not reveal material, non-public information regarding the
other parties, the Offer, the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

5.8 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  

  

(a) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree that all rights of
indemnification, exculpation and limitation of liabilities existing in favor
of past and present directors and officers of the Company as provided in the
Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or under any indemnification, employment
or other similar Contracts between such past and present directors and
officers of the Company and the Company, in each case as in effect on the date
of this Agreement with respect to acts or omissions in their capacity as
directors or officers occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, shall
survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their respective terms (unless otherwise required by applicable Law). From and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
and perform in a timely manner such indemnification obligations. Subject to
Section 5.8(c), for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation to contain provisions no less favorable with respect to
indemnification, exculpation, and advancement of expenses of directors and
officers than are currently set forth in the Company Charter and the Company
Bylaws (unless otherwise required by applicable Law).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Corporation shall maintain for the benefit of the Company's directors and
officers, as of the Effective Time, an insurance and indemnification policy
that provides coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the
"DandO Insurance") that is substantially equivalent to and in any event not less
favorable in the aggregate than the Company's existing policy (accurate and
complete copies of which have been previously provided to Parent) or, if
substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available
coverage; provided, however, that the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of
the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement, which
premium the Company represents and warrants to be as set forth on Section
5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule. The provisions of the immediately
preceding sentence shall be deemed to have been satisfied if prepaid policies
are obtained by Parent prior to the Effective Time, which policies provide
such directors and officers with substantially equivalent coverage for an
aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising from facts or
events that occurred on or before the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. If
such prepaid policies have been obtained prior to the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall maintain such policies in full force and effect,
and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.

  

  

(c) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation (i) consolidates with or
merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving
corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then proper
provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or
entity or transferee of such assets, as the case may be, shall assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 5.8.

  

  

(d) The obligations under this Section 5.8 shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect in any material respect any indemnitee
to whom this Section 5.8 applies without the consent of such affected
indemnitee, subject to applicable Law (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this Section 5.8 applies shall be third party
beneficiaries of this Section 5.8).

employment or limit the right of Parent or any of its affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) to amend or terminate or otherwise modify any
Benefit Plan following the Effective Time.

or Contract and (b) satisfy the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor
under Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan,

TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

taken or authorized by the board of directors (or appropriate committee or
designee) of the terminating party or parties, whether before or after
approval of the Merger by the stockholders of the Company:

  

  

(a) By mutual written consent of Parent and the Company at any time prior to
the Acceptance Time;

extended pursuant to Section 1.1) expires as a result of the non-satisfaction

terminated or withdrawn pursuant to its terms without any Shares being
purchased thereunder; provided, however, that the right to terminate the
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall not be available to any party

the stockholders of the Company, or otherwise within five Business Days
following Parent's written request, the Company fails to issue a press release

or the Company Board (or any committee thereof) shall authorize or publicly
propose to do any of the foregoing;

Board determines to enter into a definitive written Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, but only if the Company shall
have complied in all respects with its obligations under Section 5.4 with
respect to such Superior Proposal (and any Competing Proposal that was a
precursor thereto) and is otherwise permitted to accept such Superior Proposal

simultaneously with such termination enter into the Alternative Acquisition
Agreement and pay the Breakup Fee to Parent pursuant to Section 7.2;

an Uncured Inaccuracy in any representation or warranty of the Company

breach shall not have been cured;

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

67  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(h) By Parent, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if there has been a
Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(i) By the Company, at any time prior to the Acceptance Time if the Purchaser
shall fail to accept for payment and pay for Shares validly tendered and not
withdrawn in the Offer subject to the terms of and in accordance with Section
1.1 and at such time all of the conditions and requirements of the Offer set
forth on Annex I are satisfied;

  

  

(j) By the Company, if Parent or the Purchaser fails to commence (within the
meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer as provided in Section
1.1, within 14 Business Days of the date hereof; provided, however, that the
right to terminate the Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(j) shall not be
available if the Company's failure to fulfill any obligation under this

been a principal cause of, or resulted in, the failure of Parent or the
Purchaser to so commence the Offer; or

  

  

(k) By either the Company or Parent if the Acceptance Time has not occurred by
the Outside Date; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(k) shall not be available to any party

resulted in the failure of the Acceptance Time to occur by the Outside Date.

with respect to Section 5.3(b), Section 5.7, this Section 7.2 and Article 8
and (ii) with respect to any liabilities or damages incurred or suffered as a
result of the willful and material breach by the Company, on the one hand, or
Parent or the Purchaser, on the other hand, of any of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

  

  

(b) Parent and the Company agree that if this Agreement is terminated by
Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(d) or Section 7.1(e), then the

of a termination by the Company, or within two Business Days thereafter, in
the case of a termination by Parent, a termination fee equal to $9,000,000

Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(e), the Company shall not be obligated to pay
or reimburse Parent, the Purchaser or any of their affiliates for any of their
costs or expenses upon termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Section

Business Days after the earlier to occur of (A) the date of entrance by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary into a Contract concerning a transaction
that constitutes a Competing Proposal; (provided, that for purposes of this
Section 7.2(c), the term "Competing Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned
to such term in Section 5.4, except that the references to "20%" shall be
deemed to be references to 50%) or (B) the date any Person (other than Parent
or any Parent Subsidiary) purchases (in one or a series of transactions)
assets of the Company or any Company Subsidiary representing 50% or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company and the Companies Subsidiaries, or
Equity Interests representing 50% or more of the voting power of the Company;
provided, that any Contract or purchase referred to in clauses (A) and (B),
respectively, of this sentence is entered into or completed by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary within 12 months of the termination of this Agreement,

the Company shall reimburse the other party for all reasonable cost and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by such other party (including
reasonable costs and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection
under and enforcement of this Section 7.2.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (other than as
set forth in Section 7.2(a) and Section 7.2(e)), Parent's right to receive
payment of the Breakup Fee from the Company shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and the Purchaser against the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries and the Company Representatives for the loss suffered as a result
of the failure of the Offer and the Merger to be consummated and upon payment
of such amount, none of the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of
the Company Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation
relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  

  

(g) Each of the Company, Parent and the Purchaser acknowledges that the
agreements contained in this Section 7.2 are an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

7.3 Amendment. Subject to Section 1.3(c), this Agreement may be amended by the
Company, Parent and the Purchaser by action taken by or on behalf of their
respective boards of directors at any time prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that, after approval of the Merger by the Company's
stockholders, no amendment may be made which, by Law or in accordance with the
rules of any relevant stock exchange, requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  

  

7.4 Waiver. Subject to Section 1.3(c), at any time prior to the Effective
Time, Parent and the Purchaser, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other
hand, may (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other, (ii) waive any Uncured Inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of the other contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance by the other
with any of the agreements or covenants contained herein; provided, however,
that after any approval of this Agreement by the Company's stockholders, there
may not be any extension or waiver of this Agreement which decreases the
Merger Consideration or which adversely affects the rights of the Company's
stockholders hereunder without the approval of such stockholders. Any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby, but such extension
or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an obligation,
covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel
with respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

8.6 Headings. The headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement.

  

  

8.7 Severability. If any term or provision of this Agreement is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy,
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent
possible.

  

  

8.8 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits, the Company
Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Confidentiality Agreement, constitute the entire agreement
of the parties and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof.

  

  

8.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
parties and any assignment without such prior written consent shall be null
and void.

  

  

8.10 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure
to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns, and nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, other than pursuant to Section 5.8, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever
under or by reason of this Agreement (including the right to rely upon the
representations and warranties set forth herein).

  

  

8.11 Mutual Drafting; Interpretation. Each party hereto has participated in
the drafting of this Agreement, which each party acknowledges is the result of
extensive negotiations between the parties. If an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if
drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall
arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any
provision. For purposes of this Agreement, whenever the context requires: the
singular number shall include the plural, and vice versa, the masculine gender
shall include the feminine and neuter genders, the feminine gender shall
include the masculine and neuter genders and the neuter gender shall include
masculine and feminine genders. As used in this Agreement, the words "include"
and "including," and variations thereof, shall not be deemed to be terms of
limitation, but rather shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." Except as otherwise indicated, all references in this Agreement
to "Articles," "Sections," "Exhibits," "Annexes" and "Schedules" are intended
to refer to Articles and Sections of this Agreement and Exhibits, Annexes and
Schedules to this Agreement. The schedules and exhibits attached to this
Agreement constitute a part of this Agreement and are incorporated herein for
all purposes. The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein," "hereunder"
and words of similar import, when used in this Agreement, shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular section or article in which
such words appear. All references in this Agreement to "$" are references to
United States dollars. Unless otherwise specifically provided for herein, the
term "or" shall not be deemed to be exclusive. To the extent this Agreement
refers to information or documents to be delivered, provided or made available
to Parent or the Purchaser, the Company shall be deemed to have satisfied such
obligation if the Company has delivered, provided or made available such
information or document to Parent in the online data room managed by the

a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or
proceeding, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve process in accordance with Section 8.3, (ii) any claim that it or its
property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any
legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice,
attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment,
execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted
by applicable Law, any claim that (A) the action, claim, suit or proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (B) the venue of the action,

matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts. Each party agrees
that notice or the service of process in any action, claim, suit or proceeding

PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO TRIAL BY

EXECUTION OR PERFORMANCE HEREOF. EACH OF THE PARTIES (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE
THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO

different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  

  

8.14 Specific Performance. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no
adequate remedy at law would exist and damages would be difficult to
determine. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement exclusively in the
Chancery Court of the State of Delaware and any state appellate court
therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery Court of the State
of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
state or federal court within the State of Delaware) and any such injunction
shall be in addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled, at
law or in equity. In connection with any action for specific performance, each
party hereby irrevocably waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with the remedies referred to in this Section 8.14.
