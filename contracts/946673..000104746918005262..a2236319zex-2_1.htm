 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, representations, warranties and agreements contained herein, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as follows: 

  

  

ARTICLE I

  

  

THE MERGER

  

    1.1 _The Merger_.  Subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, in accordance with the WBCA, at the
Effective Time, the Company shall merge with and into

        

Parent. Parent shall be the Surviving Corporation in the Merger, and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Washington.
Upon consummation of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the
Company shall terminate.

  

  

 1.2 _Closing_.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m. Seattle time, at the offices of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, on a date which shall be no later than three (3) business days after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law) of all of the conditions set forth in Article VII hereof (other than those conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 

  

    
 1.3 _Effective Time_.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing, the parties shall execute, and Parent and the Company shall cause to be filed articles of merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Washington (the " _Washington Secretary_ ") and a plan of merger, as provided in the relevant provisions of the WBCA (collectively, the " _Articles of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at such time as designated in the Articles of Merger, or if no time is designated, at the time of filing of the Articles of Merger. The term "Effective Time" shall be the date and time when the Merger becomes effective, as set forth in the Articles of Merger (or if no time is designated, at the time of filing of the Articles of Merger). 

  

    
 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_.  At and after the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in the applicable provisions of the WBCA. 

  

    
 1.5 _Conversion of Company Common Stock_.  At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, the Company or the holder of any of the following securities: 

  

 (a)  Subject to Section 2.2(e), each share of the common stock, no par value, of the Company issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), except for the Cancelled Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be converted into the right to receive, without interest, 5.6664 shares, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 1.13 (as adjusted pursuant to Section 1.13, the " _Exchange Ratio_ "), of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (the " _Parent Common Stock_ ") (the " _Merger Consideration_ "); it being understood that upon the Effective Time, pursuant to Section 1.6, the Parent Common Stock, including the shares issued to former holders of Company Common Stock, shall be the common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article I shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and each certificate (each, an " _Old Certificate_ ," it being understood that any reference herein to " _Old Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company Common Stock) previously representing any such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter represent only the right to receive (i) the Merger 

        

Consideration, including without duplication, cash in lieu of fractional
shares which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old
Certificate have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 1.5 and Section 2.2(e) and (ii) any dividends or distributions which
the holder thereof has the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.2(b) upon
the surrender of such Old Certificates in accordance with Section 2.2, in each
case without any interest thereon. If, prior to the Effective Time, the
outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall have
been increased, decreased, changed into or exchanged for a different number or
kind of shares or securities as a result of a reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification, stock dividend, stock split or reverse
stock split, an appropriate and proportionate adjustment shall be made to the
Exchange Ratio and the Merger Consideration to give holders of Company Common
Stock and Parent the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement
prior to such event; _provided_ , that nothing contained herein shall be
construed to permit Parent or the Company to take any action with respect to
its securities or otherwise that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  

 (c)  At the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock that are directly owned by the Company or Parent (in each case, other than (i) shares of Company Common Stock held in trust accounts, managed accounts, mutual funds and the like, or otherwise held in a fiduciary or agency capacity, that are beneficially owned by third parties or (ii) shares of Company Common Stock held, directly or indirectly, by Parent or the Company in respect of a debt previously contracted) shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and no Merger Consideration or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor (such cancelled shares, the " _Cancelled Shares_ "). 

  

 (d)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, all shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder of Company Common Stock who did not vote in favor of this Agreement or the Merger (or consent thereto in writing) and who exercises dissenters\' rights when and in the manner required under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall be entitled to only such rights as are granted with respect to the payment of the fair value of such shares under the applicable provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA (and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided for pursuant to the applicable provisions of Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and this Section 1.5(d)), unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost rights to demand or receive the fair value of such shares of Company Common Stock under the WBCA. If any shareholder dissenting pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and this Section 1.5(d) shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost any such right, such holder\'s shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with Section 1.5(a), without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written notices the Company receives from or on behalf of its shareholders to exercise dissenters\' rights in respect of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such notices and any other instruments served pursuant to Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA and received by the Company 

        

relating to shareholders\' dissenters\' rights and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for fair
value under Chapter 23B.13 of the WBCA. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle, or offer or agree to settle, any such demand. Any Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent to exchange for shares of Company Common
Stock for which dissenters\' rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent upon demand.

  

    
 1.6 _Parent Common Stock_.  At and after the Effective Time, each share of Parent Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain an issued and outstanding share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and shall not be affected by the Merger. 

  

    
 1.7 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards._   

  

 (a)  _Company Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, each compensatory option to purchase Company Common Stock granted by the Company (a " _Company Option_ ") that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall fully vest (to the extent unvested) and shall be cancelled and converted into the right to receive a cash payment, without interest and less applicable withholding taxes, equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Option as of immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration Value over the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option as of the Effective Time. If the per share exercise price of a Company Option that is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration Value, then such Company Option shall be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Merger Consideration Value_ " means the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) the Parent Share Closing Price. 

  

 (b) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors of the Company and its Compensation Committee, as applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions that are necessary to effectuate the provisions of this Section 1.7, including providing notice to the holders of Company Options in accordance with Section 6(l) of the Amended and Restated 2005 Incentive Stock Plan of the Company (which notice shall be in a form mutually agreed by the Company and Parent). 

  

    
 1.8 _Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation_.  At the Effective Time, the Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of Parent (the " _Parent Articles_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law. 

  

    
 1.9 _Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.  At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of Parent (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter duly amended in accordance with the terms thereof and applicable law. 

        

    
 1.10 _Tax Consequences_.  It is intended that the Merger shall qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code, and that this Agreement is intended to be and is adopted as a "plan of reorganization" for the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. 

  

    
 1.11 _Bank Merger_.  Immediately following the Merger, Skagit Bank (" _Company Bank_ "), a Washington state-chartered commercial bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, will merge (the " _Bank Merger_ ") with and into Banner Bank (" _Parent Bank_ "), a Washington state-chartered commercial bank and a wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Parent Bank shall be the surviving entity in the Bank Merger and, following the Bank Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company Bank shall cease. The parties agree that the Bank Merger shall become effective immediately after the Effective Time. Promptly after the date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall cause Parent Bank and Company Bank, respectively, to enter into an agreement and plan of merger in form and substance agreed to by Parent and the Company, which shall be customary for mergers similar to the Bank Merger (the " _Bank Merger Agreement_ "), and Parent, as the sole shareholder of Parent Bank, and the Company, as the sole shareholder of Company Bank, shall each approve and adopt the Bank Merger Agreement. The Company shall cause Company Bank, and Parent shall cause Parent Bank, to execute such articles of merger and such other documents and certificates as are necessary to make the Bank Merger effective (" _Bank Merger Articles_ ") immediately following the Effective Time. 

  

    
 1.12 _Determination of Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity._   

  

 (a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity_ " means the consolidated stockholders\' equity of the Company as set forth in the Final Closing Statement prepared in accordance with, and subject to adjustment as set forth in, Section 1.12, minus any declared but unpaid dividends as of the Shareholders\' Equity Measuring Date (or thereafter declared), plus the sum of (i) all fees and expenses of all attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other advisors and agents for the Company for services rendered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) any employee severance, retention or change-in-control payments or expenses consistent with the terms of this Agreement, (iii) any payment made or expense accrued for the purchase of a directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy pursuant to Section 6.7(b), and (iv) other third-party costs, fees and expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed $50,000, in each case of clauses (i)-(iv) specifically incurred or accrued by the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby (as outlined in the example Interim Closing Statement set forth in Section 1.12(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules) (collectively, " _Transaction Costs_ "), and in each case, paid by the Company or payable by the Company prior to the Effective Time to the extent reflected as accrued liabilities in the Final Closing Statement. 

  

 (b) Not later than five (5) days after each month-end during the period from the date of this Agreement until the Final Closing Statement is delivered to Parent, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent and consistent with past practice, prepare in good faith and deliver to Parent (i) the Company\'s consolidated financial statements presenting (x) the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis as of the close of business on the last day of such month-end and (y) the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' consolidated 

        

results of operations for the period from January 1, 2018 through the close
of business on the last day of such month-end and (ii) a statement setting
forth Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity as if such month-end were the
Shareholders\' Equity Measuring Date (each such statement, an " _Interim
Closing Statement_ "). Each Interim Closing Statement shall have
been prepared in accordance with GAAP and other applicable legal and
accounting requirements, and reflect all period-end accruals and other
adjustments and shall also reflect accruals for all Transaction Costs or
other liabilities incurred or expected to be incurred at any time at or prior
to the Closing, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (whether or not doing so is in accordance with GAAP). An
example Interim Closing Statement for the month ended June 30, 2018 that
satisfies the foregoing requirements (including a proper calculation
of Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity) is set forth in Section 1.12(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedules. In the event Parent notifies the Company that it
disputes any part of any Interim Closing Statement (including Adjusted
Shareholders\' Equity stated therein), the Company shall cooperate with Parent
in good faith to resolve such dispute as promptly as possible.

  

 (c)  Not later than five (5) days after the end of the month preceding the month that includes the Anticipated Closing Date, the Company shall, in consultation with Parent, prepare in good faith and deliver to Parent an updated Interim Closing Statement as of and through the close of business on the last day of the month-end immediately preceding the Anticipated Closing Date (such statement as it may be adjusted in accordance with Section 1.12(f), the " _Final Closing Statement"_ ); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if the Anticipated Closing Date is in the first eight (8) days of a calendar month, then the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared as of the month-end of the second month preceding the Anticipated Closing Date ( _i.e._ , if the Anticipated Closing Date is on October 1, then the Final Closing Statement shall be prepared as of and through August 31) (the date which the Final Closing Statement is as of and through, the " _Shareholders\' Equity Measuring Date"_ ). Such Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Interim Closing Statements, and for the avoidance of doubt, shall set forth Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity as of the Shareholders\' Equity Measuring Date. The Company shall also deliver to Parent a certificate of the Company\'s chief financial officer, dated as of the Closing Date, to the effect that the financial statements set forth in the Final Closing Statement continue to reflect accurately, as of the Closing Date, the financial condition of the Company and its Subsidiaries in all material respects and meet the requirements of this Section 1.12(c). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Anticipated Closing Date"_ means the date on which the Closing is expected to occur based on the provisions of Section 1.2, as reasonably agreed in good faith and confirmed in writing by Parent and Company as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (d)  Parent shall have the right to review, and shall have reasonable access to, all relevant books and records, work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents prepared by the Company or its Subsidiaries or its and their respective accountants in connection with the Company\'s preparation of the Interim Closing Statements and the Final Closing Statement, as well as to executive, finance and accounting personnel of the Company and its Subsidiaries and any other information which Parent may reasonably request in connection with its review of the Interim Closing Statements and the Final Closing Statement. The Company will, and will cause its Subsidiaries and its and their accountants and other representatives to, cooperate with and assist Parent and its accountants and other representatives in the review of the Interim Closing Statements and the Final Closing Statement. 

       

                                    

    

 (e) In the event Parent disputes the Final Closing Statement (including Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity set forth therein), Parent shall, no later than the later of (i) three (3) days after receiving the Final Closing Statement and (ii) two (2) days prior to the Anticipated Closing Date, give the Company written notice of its objections thereto (the " _Objection Notice"_ ), describing the nature of the dispute in reasonable detail and specifying those items and amounts as to which Parent disagrees and, based on the information at its disposal, specifying Parent\'s proposed calculation of Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity. If Parent does not timely deliver an Objection Notice prior to the date specified in the previous sentence, Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity set forth in the Final Closing Statement delivered by the Company shall be utilized for the calculation of the adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 1.13 and shall be final and binding on all the parties. Any items or amounts set forth in the Final Closing Statement as to which Parent does not disagree in the Objection Notice shall be final and binding on all the parties. 

  

 (f)  If Parent timely delivers an Objection Notice, Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute, and if resolved, the Final Closing Statement and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity as determined by Parent and the Company in writing shall be utilized for calculation of the adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 1.13 and shall be final and binding on all the parties. If Parent and the Company cannot resolve the dispute within five (5) days after the date of the Objection Notice (the " _Negotiation Period_ "), Parent and the Company shall appoint a mutually acceptable independent accounting firm of national or regional reputation (the " _Independent Accounting Firm_ ") to promptly review this Agreement and the disputed items in the Objection Notice and arbitrate the dispute and determine the Final Closing Statement and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable access to all records, work papers, schedules, memoranda and other documents relevant to such dispute. The Independent Accounting Firm shall be limited to addressing only the particular disputes referred to in the Objection Notice that have not been resolved by Parent and the Company and shall determine such disputed amounts, the Final Closing Statement, and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. Upon reaching its determination of the Final Closing Statement and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity based on its determination of the disputed items, the Independent Accounting Firm shall deliver a copy of its calculation of the Final Closing Statement and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity to Parent and the Company. The determination of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be made within twenty (20) days after its engagement (which engagement shall be made no later than five (5) days after the end of the Negotiation Period) and shall be final and binding on all the parties. No party or its affiliates shall seek further recourse to courts, other tribunals or otherwise, other than to enforce the final decision of the Independent Accounting Firm as to the determination of the Final Closing Statement and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity. The aggregate fees, expenses and costs of the Independent Accounting Firm shall be borne (i) by Parent, if the difference, in absolute value terms, between Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity as finally determined and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity set forth in the Objection Notice is greater than the difference, in absolute value terms, between Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity as finally determined and Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity set forth in the Final Closing Statement as delivered by the Company to Parent and (ii) otherwise by the Company, in the form of a reduction to Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity for purposes of calculating the adjustment to the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section 1.13. For the avoidance of doubt, the dispute resolution process contemplated by Section 1.12(e) and Section 1.12(f) shall 

        

be only to determine the disputed items reflected on the Final Closing
Statement and necessary to the calculation of Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity
as of the Shareholders\' Equity Measuring Date, regardless of the date on
which the Independent Accounting Firm delivers its calculation.

  

    
 1.13 _Exchange Ratio Adjustment_.  

  

 (a) If Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.12, is greater than or equal to $80,000,000, there shall be no adjustment to the Exchange Ratio, and to the extent Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.12, exceeds $80,000,000, the Company may, in accordance with Section 6.17, declare and pay a special cash dividend immediately prior to the Closing, in an amount not to exceed such excess. 

  

 (b) If Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.12, is less than $80,000,000, the Exchange Ratio shall be reduced by the Exchange Ratio Reduction Amount. 

  

 (c)  For purposes of this Agreement (i) the term " _Exchange Ratio Reduction Amount_ " shall mean an amount, rounded to the ten-thousandth decimal point, equal to (A) the Shareholders\' Equity Shortfall, _divided by_ (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Cancelled Shares), _divided by_ (C) the Parent Share Closing Price and (ii) the term " _Shareholders\' Equity Shortfall_ " shall mean the absolute value of the amount by which Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity, as finally determined pursuant to Section 1.12, is less than $80,000,000. 

  

  

    
ARTICLE II 

EXCHANGE OF SHARES 

  

    2.1 _Parent to Make
Merger Consideration Available_.  At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with an exchange agent
designated by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders of Old Certificates, for
exchange in accordance with this Article II, (a) certificates or, at
Parent\'s option, evidence of shares in book-entry form, representing the
shares of Parent Common Stock (collectively, referred to herein as " _New
Certificates_ "), to be delivered to the holders of Company Common Stock
pursuant to Section 1.5, and (b) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
required to be paid to holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to
this Article II (such New Certificates and cash, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ ").

  

    
 2.2 _Exchange of Shares_.  

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event later than five (5) business days thereafter, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more Old Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time that have been converted at the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Article I, (i) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Old Certificates shall 

        

pass, only upon proper delivery of the Old Certificates to the Exchange Agent
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Old Certificates in exchange for New Certificates
representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock and any cash in
lieu of fractional shares which the shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such Old Certificates shall have been converted into the right
to receive pursuant to this Agreement, as well as any dividends or
distributions to be paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 2.2(b). Upon
proper surrender of an Old Certificate or Old Certificates for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by a properly completed Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Old Certificate or Old
Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable,
(i) a New Certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock to which such holder of Company Common Stock shall have become
entitled pursuant to the provisions of Article I and (ii) a
check representing the amount of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares
that such holder has the right to receive in respect of the Old Certificate or
Old Certificates surrendered pursuant to the provisions of this Article II
and (B) any dividends or distributions that the holder presenting such Old
Certificate or Old Certificates has the right to receive pursuant to
this Section 2.2, and the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered
shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any
Merger Consideration, dividends or distributions or cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable to holders of Old Certificates. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this Section 2.2, each Old Certificate shall be deemed at any
time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon
surrender, the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares
or in respect of dividends or distributions as contemplated by this Section
2.2.

  

 (b) No dividends or other distributions declared with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Old Certificate until such holder shall surrender such Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II. After the surrender of an Old Certificate in accordance with this Article II, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to the whole shares of Parent Common Stock that the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Old Certificate have been converted into the right to receive. 

  

 (c)  If any New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor is or are registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Old Certificate or Old Certificates so surrendered shall be properly endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper form for transfer, and that the person requesting such exchange shall pay in advance any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of the issuance of a New Certificate representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Old Certificate or Old Certificates surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of Parent and the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable. 

  

 (d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the shares of Company Common Stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Old 

        

Certificates representing such shares are presented for transfer to the
Exchange Agent, they shall be cancelled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration as provided in this Article II.

  

 (e)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no New Certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Old Certificates, no dividend or distribution with respect to Parent Common Stock shall be payable on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional share, Parent shall pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional share an amount in cash (rounded to the nearest cent) determined by _multiplying_ (i) the average of the closing price per share of Parent Common Stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (the " _NASDAQ_ ") as reported by www.nasdaq.com for the consecutive period of five (5) full trading days immediately preceding (but not including) the date that is the second (2nd) business day prior to the Closing Date (or, if not reported therein, in another authoritative source mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company) (the " _Parent Share Closing Price_ ") _by_ (ii) the fraction of a share (after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder immediately prior to the Effective Time and rounded to the nearest one-thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of Parent Common Stock to which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 1.5. The parties acknowledge that payment of such cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares is not separately bargained-for consideration, but merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience that would otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional shares. 

  

 (f)  Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation. Any former holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore exchanged their Old Certificates in compliance with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the Parent Common Stock deliverable in respect of each former share of Company Common Stock such shareholder holds as determined pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of Company Common Stock for any amount delivered in good faith to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. 

  

 (g)  Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock, cash dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(b) or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or Company Equity Awards such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, and paid over to the appropriate governmental authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder in 

        

respect of which the deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

  

 (h) In the event any Old Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Old Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Exchange Agent may determine is reasonably necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Old Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Old Certificate the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of fractional shares, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement, and any dividends or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.2(b). 

  

 (i)  Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent, in the exercise of its reasonable discretion, shall have the right to make all determinations, not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, governing (i) the validity of any Letter of Transmittal and compliance by any holder of Company Common Stock with the procedures and instructions set forth herein and therein, (ii) the issuance and delivery of the whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock into which shares of Company Common Stock are converted in the Merger and (iii) the method of payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

  

    
ARTICLE III 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY 

   

 Except as disclosed in the applicable section of the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent concurrently herewith (the " _Company Disclosure Schedules_ "); _provided_ that (i) no such item is required to be set forth as an exception to a representation or warranty if its absence would not result in the related representation or warranty being deemed untrue or incorrect, (ii) the mere inclusion of an item in the Company Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a representation or warranty shall not be deemed an admission by the Company that such item represents a material exception or fact, event or circumstance or that such item is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect and (iii) any disclosures made with respect to a section of Article III shall be deemed to qualify (a) any other section of Article III specifically referenced or cross-referenced and (b) other sections of Article III to the extent it is reasonably apparent on its face (notwithstanding the absence of a specific cross reference) from a reading of the disclosure that such disclosure applies to such other sections, the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent as follows: 

  

    
 3.1 _Corporate Organization._   

  

 (a) The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Washington, and is a bank holding company duly registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (" _BHC Act_ "). The Company has the corporate power and authority to own, lease or operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. The Company is duly licensed or qualified to do business and in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the 

        

business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,
except where the failure to be so licensed or qualified or to be in good
standing would not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, any
effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development
that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had or would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on (i) the business, properties,
assets, liabilities, results of operations or condition (financial or
otherwise) of such party and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole ( _provided_
,  _however_ , that, with respect to this clause (i), Material Adverse Effect
shall not be deemed to include the impact of (A) changes, after the date
hereof, in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") or
applicable regulatory accounting requirements or the enforcement,
implementation or interpretation thereof, (B) changes, after the date hereof,
in laws, rules or regulations of general applicability to companies in the
industries in which such party and its Subsidiaries operate, (C)
changes, after the date hereof, in global, national or regional political
conditions (including the outbreak of war or acts of terrorism) or in economic
or market conditions affecting the financial services industry generally and
not specifically relating to such party or its Subsidiaries, including any
disruption in any financial, banking or securities markets in general and any
decline in the price of any market index or any change in prevailing interest
rates, (D) changes relating to or arising out of the public disclosure of this
Agreement or of the transactions contemplated hereby (provided that this
exception shall not apply for purposes of the representations and warranties
in Section 3.3(b) or Section 4.3(b)), (E) a failure, in and of itself, to
meet earnings projections or internal financial forecasts, but not including
any underlying causes thereof, or changes in the trading price of Company
Common Stock or Parent Common Stock (as applicable), in and of itself, but
not including any underlying causes thereof or (F) actions that are taken with
the express prior written consent of the other party in contemplation of the
transactions contemplated hereby; except, with respect to subclauses (A),
(B), or (C), to the extent that the effects of such change are
disproportionately adverse to such party and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, as compared to other companies in the industries in which such party
and its Subsidiaries operate) or (ii) the ability of such party to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. As used in this Agreement, the word "
_Subsidiary_ " when used with respect to any person, means any corporation,
partnership, limited liability company, bank, trust, association, joint
venture or other organization, whether incorporated or unincorporated, or
person of which (i) such first person directly or indirectly owns or controls
at least a majority of the securities or other interests having by their
terms ordinary voting power to elect a majority of the board of directors or
others performing similar functions or (ii) such first person is or directly
or indirectly has the power to appoint a general partner, manager or managing
member or others performing similar functions. True and complete copies of the
Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation of the Company (the " _Company
Articles_ ") and the Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the "
_Company Bylaws_ "), as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, have
previously been made available by the Company to Parent. The Company is not in
violation of any of the provisions of the Company Articles or the Company
Bylaws.

  

 (b)  Each Subsidiary of the Company (a " _Company Subsidiary_ ") (i) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly licensed or qualified to do business and, where such concept is recognized under applicable law, 

        

in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, local or
foreign) in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the character
or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes such
licensing or qualification necessary and in which the failure to be so
licensed or qualified or in good standing would reasonably be expected, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on the
Company and (iii) has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease or operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
now conducted. There are no restrictions on the ability of any Subsidiary of
the Company to pay dividends or distributions, except in the case of a
Subsidiary that is a regulated entity, for restrictions on dividends or

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, since January 1, 2015, Parent and each
of its Subsidiaries have properly administered all accounts for which Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries acts as a fiduciary, including accounts for which
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries serves as a trustee, agent, custodian,
personal representative, guardian, conservator or investment adviser, in
compliance with the terms of the applicable governing documents and applicable
law. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any director, officer or
employee of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, has committed any breach of
trust with respect to any such fiduciary account that would be material to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and the accountings for each
such fiduciary account are true and correct in all material respects and
accurately reflect in all material respects the assets of such fiduciary
account. As of the date hereof, Parent, Parent Bank and each other insured
depositary Subsidiary of Parent is "well-capitalized" (as that term is defined
in the relevant regulation of the institution\'s primary bank regulatory)
and, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
received any indication from a Governmental Entity that its status as "well-
capitalized" or that Parent Bank\'s Community Reinvestment Act rating will
change within one (1) year from the date of this Agreement.

 (b) (i) Each Parent Contract is valid and binding on Parent or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, and in full force and effect, except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (ii) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has performed and complied with all obligations required to be performed by it under each Parent Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (iii) to the knowledge of Parent, each third-party counterparty to each Parent Contract has performed and complied with all obligations required to be performed by it under such Parent Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent, (iv) neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries knows of, or has received notice of, any violation of any Parent 

        

Contract by any of the parties thereto which would reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on
the Parent, and (v) no event or condition exists that constitutes or, after
notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a breach or default on the
part of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the knowledge of Parent,
any other party thereto, of or under any such Parent Contract, except where
such default, either individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent.

 4.14 _Reorganization_.   Parent has not taken any action and is not aware of any fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 

  

  

 4.15 _Opinion_. Pri or to the execution of this Agreement, Parent has received an opinion from D.A. Davidson and Co., to the effect that, as of the date thereof and based upon and subject to the matters set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair from a financial point of view to Parent. Such opinion has not been amended or rescinded as of the date of this Agreement. 

  

    
 4.16 _Parent Information_.  The information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries to be contained in the Proxy Statement and the S-4, and the information relating to Parent and its Subsidiaries or that is provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries or representatives for inclusion in any other application, notification or document filed with any Regulatory Agency or other Governmental Entity in connection herewith, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they are made, not misleading.

assets, liabilities, or condition (financial or otherwise), and Parent hereby
disclaims any such other representations or warranties.

  

 (b)  Parent acknowledges and agrees that neither the Company nor any other person has made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty other than those contained in Article III.

Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult the other on, in each case subject to applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, all the information relating to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party or any Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions contemplated by this 

        

Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the parties hereto
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. The parties hereto agree
that they will consult with each other with respect to the obtaining of all
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all third parties and
Governmental Entities necessary or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and each party will keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated herein, subject to applicable law.

  

 (c)  Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to resolve any objections that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall Parent or any of its Subsidiaries be required, and the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not be permitted (without Parent\'s written consent), to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction, in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of Governmental Entities that would reasonably be expected to be materially burdensome on, or impair in any material respect the benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries, or have a material and adverse effect on Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (in each case, measured on a scale relative to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), after giving effect to the Merger (any of the foregoing, a " _Materially Burdensome Regulatory Condition_ "). 

  

 (d)  Parent and the Company shall, upon request, promptly furnish each other with all information concerning themselves, their Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy Statement, the S-4 or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality._

concerning its business, properties and personnel as such party may reasonably
request. Neither Parent nor the Company nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the

jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the institution in possession or
control of such information (after giving due consideration to the existence
of any common interest, joint defense or similar agreement between the
parties) or contravene any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment, decree,
fiduciary duty or binding agreement entered into prior to the date of this
Agreement. The parties hereto will make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply.

  

 (b)  Each of Parent and the Company shall hold all information furnished by or on behalf of the other party or any of such party\'s Subsidiaries or representatives pursuant to Section 6.2(a) in confidence to the extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the confidentiality agreement, dated March 29, 2018, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "). 

  

 (c)  No investigation by either of the parties or their respective representatives shall affect or be deemed to modify or waive the representations and warranties of the other set forth herein.

 6.3 _Shareholder Approval_.  

  

 (a) The Company shall call a meeting of its shareholders (the " _Company Meeting_ ") to be held as soon as reasonably practicable after the S-4 is declared effective, for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite Company Vote required in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and, if so desired and mutually agreed, upon other matters of the type customarily brought before a meeting of shareholders to approve a merger agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Meeting to occur as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company and its Board of Directors shall use their reasonable best efforts to obtain from the shareholders of the Company the Requisite Company Vote, including by communicating to its shareholders its recommendation (and including such recommendation in the Proxy Statement) that they adopt and approve this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ "), and shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to Parent the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) fail to make the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) adopt, approve, recommend or endorse an Acquisition Proposal or publicly announce an intention to adopt, approve, recommend or endorse 

        

an Acquisition Proposal, (iv) fail to publicly, finally and without
qualification (A) recommend against any Acquisition Proposal or (B) reaffirm
the Company Board Recommendation, in each case within ten (10) business days
after such Acquisition Proposal is made public or any request by Parent to do
so (which request may be made once per Acquisition Proposal, and any material
change thereto) (or such fewer number of days as remains prior to Company
Meeting), or (v) publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any of the
foregoing, a " _Recommendation Change_ ").

  

 (b)  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company may make a Recommendation Change if and only if (i) the Company and its Subsidiaries and Representatives have complied with their obligations under Section 6.12, (ii) an unsolicited _bona fide_  written Acquisition Proposal is made to the Company after the date of this Agreement by a third party, and such Acquisition Proposal is not withdrawn, (iii) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (iv) the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to make a Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable law, (v) prior to effecting the Recommendation Change, three (3) business days shall have elapsed since the Company has given written notice to Parent advising Parent that the Company intends to take such action and specifying in reasonable detail the reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of, and the identity of the person making, any such Acquisition Proposal that is the basis of the Recommendation Change (it being understood that any amendment or change to any material term of such Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice and the provisions of this Section 6.3(b) shall apply anew), (vi) during such three (3) business day period, the Company has considered, and engaged in good-faith discussions with Parent regarding, any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and (vii) the Board of Directors of the Company, following such three (3)-business day period, again reasonably determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, and taking into account any adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent and delivered to the Company in writing) that such Acquisition Proposal nonetheless continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and that failure to make a Recommendation Change would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable law. 

  

 (c)  The Company shall adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting if, as of the time for which such meeting is originally scheduled, there are insufficient shares of Company Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of such meeting, or if on the date of such meeting the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of shares necessary to obtain the Requisite Company Vote; _provided_ , that no such adjournment or postponement shall delay the Company Meeting by more than ten (10) days from the prior-scheduled date or to a date on or after the fifth (5th) business day preceding the Termination Date. Except as described in the preceding sentence, the Company shall not adjourn or postpone the Company Meeting without Parent\'s written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

        

 (d)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms (i) the Company Meeting shall be convened and this Agreement shall be submitted to the shareholders of the Company at the Company Meeting for the purpose of voting on the approval of this Agreement, and nothing contained herein shall be deemed to relieve the Company of such obligations, and (ii) the Company shall not submit to the vote of its shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or any transaction contemplated thereby.

Parent shall honor all change-in-control or severance agreements set forth in Section 6.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules in accordance with their respective terms. In addition, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries to, provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment terminates during the 12-month period following the Closing Date and who is not 

        

party to an individual change-in-control or severance agreement with
severance benefits equal to the severance benefits for which such Continuing
Employee would be eligible under the severance plans or policies of Parent or
its affiliates after providing recognition of service to the Company and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 6.6(b).

  

 (b)  Following the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, cause any employee benefit plans sponsored or maintained by Parent or the Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries in which the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") to recognize and provide credit for the service of each Continuing Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor thereto) prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits under such Parent Plans; _provided_ that such recognition of and credit for service shall not (i) apply for purposes of any Parent Plan that is a defined benefit retirement plan or any Parent Plan that provides retiree welfare benefits, (ii) operate to duplicate any benefits of a Continuing Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or arrangement (A) under which similarly situated employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries do not receive recognition or credit for prior service or (B) that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of benefits or participation. With respect to any Parent Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan year in which such Continuing Employee is first eligible to participate, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (1) cause any preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with respect to such Continuing Employee to the extent such limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (2) credit each Continuing Employee for any co-payments, deductibles or out-of-pocket expenses incurred by such Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents in such plan year for purposes of any applicable co-payment, deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any such Parent Plan. Parent and its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall assume and honor, under the sick leave and vacation policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries as set forth on Section 6.6(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedules, the accrued but unused sick leave and vacation time of the Continuing Employees prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c)  If requested by Parent at least fifteen (15) days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall cause any 401(k) plan sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, a " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") to be terminated effective as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date and contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing. In the event that Parent so requests that any Company 401(k) Plan be terminated, (i) the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such plan has been terminated (the form and substance of which shall be subject to reasonable review and approval by Parent) not later than two (2) days immediately preceding the Closing Date; and (ii) Parent shall permit (and, to the extent necessary, shall amend Parent\'s existing 401(k) Plan(s) to permit) the Continuing Employees who are participants in such Company 401(k) Plan and then actively employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code, inclusive of loans but excluding any shares of Parent Common Stock) in cash or notes (in the case of loans) in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to any such Company Employee from the Company 401(k) Plan(s) to Parent\'s existing 401(k) plan(s). 

        

 (d)  Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates any right to continue in the employ or service of the Surviving Corporation, the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the rights of the Surviving Corporation, the Company, Parent or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to discharge or terminate the services of any employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates at any time for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Company Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other employee benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement, or (ii) alter or limit the ability of the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any particular Company Benefit Plan, Parent Plan or any other employee benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement after the Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of Section 9.9, nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any person other than the parties hereto, including any current or former employee, officer, director or consultant of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates, any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

    
  6.7 _Indemnification; Directors\' and
Officers\' Insurance._   

  

 (a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the extent such persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to the Company Articles and the Company Bylaws, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect on the date hereof and disclosed in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules (and shall also advance expenses as incurred to the extent provided under the Company Articles and Company Bylaws (or such agreements listed in Section 6.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules) as in effect as of the date of this Agreement), each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each case, when acting in such capacity) (collectively, the " _Company Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees), judgments, fines, losses, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, whether arising before or after the Effective Time, arising out of the fact that such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such Company Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company ( _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies with substantially comparable insurer of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions which are no less advantageous to the insured) with respect to claims arising from facts or events which occurred at or before the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation be obligated to 

        

expend, on an annual basis, an amount in excess of 250% of the current annual
premium paid as of the date hereof by the Company for such insurance (the "
_Premium Cap_ "), and if such premiums for such insurance would at any time
exceed the Premium Cap, then the Surviving Corporation shall cause to be
maintained policies of insurance which, in the Surviving Corporation\'s good
faith determination, provide the maximum coverage available at an annual
premium not exceeding the Premium Cap. In lieu of the foregoing, Parent or the
Company, in consultation with, but only upon the consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may (and
at the request of Parent, the Company shall) obtain at or prior to the
Effective Time a six-year "tail" policy under the Company\'s existing
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance policy providing equivalent
coverage to that described in the preceding sentence, if and to the
extent that the same may be obtained for an amount that, in the aggregate,
does not exceed the Premium Cap.

  

 (c)  The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Company Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives. In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation will expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.7. 

  

    
 6.8 _Additional Agreements_.  In case at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement (including any merger between a Subsidiary of Parent, on the one hand, and a Subsidiary of the Company, on the other hand) or to vest the Surviving Corporation with full title to all properties, assets, rights, approvals, immunities and franchises of any of the parties to the Merger, the proper officers and directors of each party to this Agreement and their respective Subsidiaries shall take all such necessary action as may be required or reasonably requested by Parent or the Company. 

  

    
 6.9 _Advice of Changes_.  Parent and the Company shall each promptly advise the other party of any fact, effect, change, event, circumstance, condition, occurrence or development that (i) has had or is reasonably likely, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on it or (ii) would or would be reasonably likely to cause or constitute a material breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein or that reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate, to the failure of a condition in Article VII; provided, that any failure to give notice in accordance with the foregoing with respect to any breach shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section 6.9 or the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by the party failing to give such notice, in each case unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure of the conditions set forth in Section 7.2 or 7.3 to be satisfied; and provided, further, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.9 shall not cure any breach of, or noncompliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or limit the remedies available to the party receiving such notice. 

       

                                    

    

  

 6.10 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any shareholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors or officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give Parent an opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any such litigation. The Company shall give Parent the right to review and comment on all filings or responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such litigation, and the Company will in good faith take such comments into account, and no settlement of any such shareholder litigation shall be offered or agreed to without Parent\'s prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). 

   

  

 6.11 _Governance Matters._ 

  

 (a) The directors of Parent at the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until their successors are duly elected or appointed; _provided_ , that effective immediately following the Effective Time, Parent shall take such action as is necessary to appoint Cheryl Bishop to the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (b) The officers of Parent at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation from and after the Effective Time until their successors are duly elected or appointed, together with such additional persons as may thereafter be elected or appointed. 

  

  

 6.12 _Acquisition Proposals_. Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.12, the Company agrees that it will not, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents, advisors, financing sources, investment bankers, attorneys and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiries or proposals regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage or participate in any negotiations with any person concerning any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) disclose or provide any confidential or nonpublic information to, have or participate in any discussions with or otherwise cooperate in any way with, any person in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal (including by affording access to the personnel, properties, books, records or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries) or (iv) unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, approve or enter into any term sheet, letter of intent, commitment, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement, or other agreement (whether written or oral, binding or nonbinding) (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to and entered into in accordance with this Section 6.12) in connection with or relating to any Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote and subject to compliance with this Section 6.12, in the event the Company receives an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date of this Agreement that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.12, it may, and may permit its Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries\' Representatives to, furnish or cause to be furnished confidential or nonpublic information or data and participate in such negotiations or discussions with the person making the Acquisition Proposal if and only if its Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and that the failure to take such actions would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the 

        

directors\' fiduciary duties under applicable law; provided, further, that
prior to providing any confidential or nonpublic information permitted to be
provided pursuant to the foregoing proviso or participating in such
negotiations or discussions, the Company shall have given Parent at least five
(5) business days\' prior written notice and shall have entered into a
confidentiality agreement with such third party on terms no less favorable to
it than the Confidentiality Agreement, which confidentiality agreement shall
not provide such person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the
Company. The Company shall provide Parent with a copy of any confidential or
nonpublic information provided to any person pursuant to the prior sentence
prior to or simultaneously with furnishing such information to such person
(to the extent not previously provided). The Company will, and will cause its
Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated
any activities, discussions or negotiations conducted before the date of this
Agreement with any person other than Parent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal and will request the return or destruction of any
information provided to any such person in connection therewith. The Company
will promptly (and within twenty-four (24) hours) advise Parent following
receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry which could reasonably be
expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and the substance thereof
(including the terms and conditions of and the identity of the person making
such inquiry or Acquisition Proposal) and will provide Parent an unredacted
copy of such Acquisition Proposal and any draft agreements, proposals or other
materials or correspondence received in connection with such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal, and will keep Parent apprised of any related
developments, discussions and negotiations on a current basis, including any
amendments to or revisions of the terms of such inquiry or Acquisition
Proposal (including providing an unredacted copy of such amended or revised
Acquisition Proposal and any further or revised draft agreements, proposals or
other materials or correspondence received in connection with such inquiry or
Acquisition Proposal). The Company shall enforce any existing confidentiality
agreements to which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party in accordance
with the terms thereof and will not release any third party from, or waive any
provisions of, any such agreements. As used in this Agreement, "
_Acquisition Proposal_ " shall mean, other than the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, any offer, proposal or inquiry relating to, or any third
party indication of interest in, (i) any acquisition or purchase, direct or
indirect, of fifteen percent (15%) or more of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company, (ii) any tender offer (including a
self-tender offer), exchange offer or other acquisition of equity or voting
securities that, if consummated, would result in such third
party beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more of any class of
equity or voting securities of the Company or its Subsidiaries whose assets,
individually or in the aggregate, constitute fifteen percent (15%) or more of
the consolidated assets of the Company or (iii) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company
or its Subsidiaries. As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means
an unsolicited, _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal made by a third
party to acquire, directly or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange
offer, merger, consolidation or other business combination or acquisition
transaction, all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or all of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock, and which the Board of Directors of the Company has in good
faith determined (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and
financial advisors, and taking

        

into account the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and this
Agreement (as it may be proposed to be amended by Parent) and all legal,
financial, timing, regulatory and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal
and the person making the proposal), to be more favorable, from a financial
point of view, to the Company\'s shareholders than the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (as it may be proposed to be
amended by Parent) and to be reasonably likely to be consummated on a timely
basis on the terms proposed.

  

  

 6.13 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that the initial press release with respect to the execution and delivery of this Agreement shall be a release mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, each of the parties agrees that no public release or announcement or statement concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by any party without the prior written consent of the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as required by applicable law or the rules or regulations of any applicable Governmental Entity or stock exchange to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall consult with the other party about, and allow the other party reasonable time to comment on, such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. 

  

  

 6.14 _Change of Method_. Parent shall be empowered, at any time prior to the Effective Time, to change the method or structure of effecting the combination of the Company and Parent (including the provisions of Article I), and the Company agrees to enter into such amendments to this Agreement as Parent may reasonably request to give effect to such restructuring; provided, however, that no such change or amendment shall (i) alter or change the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration provided for in this Agreement, (ii) adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to either party or its shareholders or (iii) impede or materially delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the receipt of the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. 

  

  

 6.15 _Restructuring Efforts_. If the Company shall have failed to obtain the Requisite Company Vote at the duly convened Company Meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, unless this Agreement has been validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1, each of the parties shall in good faith use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate a restructuring of the transactions provided for herein (it being understood that neither party shall have any obligation to alter or change any material terms, including the amount or kind of the Merger Consideration, in a manner adverse to such party or its shareholders or to agree to any change that would adversely affect the Tax treatment of the Merger with respect to such party or its shareholders) and/or resubmit this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (or as restructured pursuant to this Section 6.15) to the Company\'s shareholders for approval. 

  

  

 6.16 _Takeover Statutes_. None of the Company, Parent or their respective Boards of Directors shall take any action that would cause any Takeover Statute to become applicable to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby, and each shall take all necessary steps to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from any applicable Takeover Statute now or hereafter in effect. If any Takeover Statute may become, or may purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, each party and their respective Boards of Directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that the transactions contemplated 

        

by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of any Takeover Statute on any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including, if necessary, challenging the validity or
applicability of any such Takeover Statute.

  

  

 6.17 _Special Dividend_. After Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity has been finally determined pursuant to Section 1.12, to the extent Adjusted Shareholders\' Equity, as so determined, exceeds $80,000,000, the Board of Directors of the Company may, upon written notice to Parent and effective immediately prior to the Closing, declare and pay a special dividend in an amount not to exceed such excess.

 (d) by either Parent or the Company ( _provided_ , that the terminating party is not then in material breach of any representation, warranty, obligation, covenant or other agreement contained herein), if there shall have been a breach of any of the obligations, covenants or agreements or any of the representations or warranties (or any such representation or warranty shall cease to be true) set forth in this Agreement on the part of the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, which breach or failure to be true, either individually or in the aggregate with all other breaches by such party (or failures of such representations or warranties to be true), would constitute, if occurring or continuing on the Closing Date, the failure of a condition set forth in Section 7.2, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Section 7.3, in the case of a termination by the Company, and which is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice to the Company, in the case of a termination by Parent, or Parent, in the case of a termination by the Company, or by its nature or timing cannot be cured during such period (or such fewer days as remain prior to the Termination Date); 

  

 (e) by the Company if (i) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its obligations under Section 6.3 (including with respect to any requested adjournment or postponement requested under Section 6.3(c)) and Section 6.12, (ii) the Company Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded 

        

with the vote contemplated by Section 6.3(a) having been taken and the
Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained and (iii) prior to the
Company Meeting, the Company shall have received a Superior Proposal which
did not result from a breach of Section 6.3 or Section 6.12 and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined to enter into a
definitive agreement providing for such Superior Proposal upon termination of
this Agreement in accordance with this Section 8.1(e) and shall have entered
into such agreement concurrently with such termination; _provided_ , that (x)
following such Company Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments
thereof) and prior to such termination, the Company and the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have complied with their respective obligations
pursuant to Sections 6.3(b)(v), 6.3(b)(vi) and 6.3(b)(vii), which shall be
deemed to apply to a termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(e) _mutatis
mutandis_ (it being understood that references to "Recommendation Change"
therein shall, for purposes of this clause (x), be deemed to be references to
a termination pursuant to this Section 8.1(e)) and (y) concurrently with and
as a condition to the effectiveness of such termination the Company shall pay
Parent the Termination Fee pursuant to Section 8.2(d);

  

 (f)  by Parent if the Company Meeting (including any postponements or adjournments thereof) shall have concluded with the vote contemplated by Section 6.3(a) having been taken and the Requisite Company Vote shall not have been obtained; or 

  

 (g) by Parent, prior to the Requisite Company Vote having been obtained, if the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company shall have (i) made a Recommendation Change or (ii) breached its obligations under Section 6.3 or 6.12 in any material respect. 

  

  

 8.2 _Effect of Termination_. 

  

 (a) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in Section 8.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and none of Parent, the Company, any of their respective Subsidiaries or any of the officers or directors of any of them shall have any liability of any nature whatsoever hereunder, or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, except that (i) Section 6.2(b) (Access to Information; Confidentiality), Section 6.13 (Public Announcements), Section 8.1 (Termination), this Section 8.2 (Effect of Termination) and Article IX (General Provisions) shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Company shall be relieved or released from any liabilities or damages arising out of its fraud or willful and material breach of any provision of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) In the event that, after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement, (i) a _bona fide_ Acquisition Proposal shall have been communicated to or otherwise made known to the Board of Directors or senior management of the Company or shall have been made directly to the shareholders of the Company, or any person shall have publicly announced an Acquisition Proposal, with respect to the Company, (ii) thereafter this Agreement is terminated (A) by either Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(c) (if the Requisite Company Vote has not theretofore been obtained but all other conditions set forth in Sections 7.1 and 7.3 had been satisfied or were capable of being satisfied prior to such termination) or (B) by Parent (x) pursuant to Section 8.1(d) or (y) pursuant to Section 

        

8.1(f), and (iii) prior to the date that is twelve (12) months after the date
of such termination, the Company enters into a definitive agreement or
consummates a transaction with respect to an Acquisition Proposal (whether or
not the same Acquisition Proposal as that referred to above), then the Company
shall, on the earlier of the date it enters into such definitive
agreement and the date of consummation of such transaction, pay Parent, by
wire transfer of same-day funds, a fee equal to $7,750,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ");  _provided_ , that for purposes of this Section 8.2(b), all
references in the definition of Acquisition Proposal to "fifteen percent
(15%)" shall instead refer to "fifty percent (50%)."

  

 (c)  In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(g), then the Company shall pay Parent, by wire transfer of same day funds, the Termination Fee within two business days of the date of termination. 

  

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 8.1(e), then the Company shall, concurrently with and as a condition to such termination, pay Parent the Termination Fee by wire transfer of same day funds. 

  

 (e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section 8.2 when required, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent commences a suit which results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee or any portion thereof, the Company shall pay the costs and expenses of Parent (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In addition, if the Company fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this Section 8.2 when required, then the Company shall pay interest on such overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such overdue amount is actually paid in full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" published in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made _plus_ 300 basis points for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by the Company pursuant to this Section 8.2 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and, except in the case of fraud or willful and material breach of this Agreement, shall be the sole monetary remedy of Parent in the event of a termination of this Agreement specified in such section. In no event shall the Company be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. 

  

  

 8.3 _Amendment_.  Subject to compliance with applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, at any time before or after receipt of the Requisite Company Vote; provided, however, that after the receipt of the Requisite Company Vote, there may not be, without further approval of such shareholders, any amendment of this Agreement that requires such further approval under applicable law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. 

  

  

 8.4 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document delivered 

        

by such other party pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any of the
agreements or satisfaction of any conditions for its benefit contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver
shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of
such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict
compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to Articles, Sections, Exhibits or Schedules, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of or Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated.

schedules and all exhibits hereto, shall be deemed part of this Agreement and
included in any reference to this Agreement.

  

  

 9.5 _Counterparts_  . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

    
 9.6 _Entire Agreement_.  This Agreement (including the Voting Agreements and the other documents and instruments referred to herein) together with the Confidentiality Agreement constitutes the entire agreement among the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 (a)  This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Washington, without regard to any applicable conflicts of law. 

  

 (b)  Each party agrees that it will bring any action or proceeding in respect of any claim arising out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby exclusively in any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction located in the State of Washington (the " _Chosen Courts_ "), and, solely in connection with claims arising under this Agreement or the transactions that are the subject of this Agreement, (i) irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts, (ii) waives any objection to laying venue in any such action or proceeding in the Chosen Courts, (iii) waives any objection that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or do not have jurisdiction over any party and (iv) agrees that service of process upon such party in any such action or proceeding will be effective if notice is given in accordance with Section 9.3. 

  

    
 9.8 _Waiver of Jury Trial_.  EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AT THE TIME OF INSTITUTION OF THE APPLICABLE LITIGATION, ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT: (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.8.

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other party. Any purported assignment in contravention hereof shall be null and void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns. Except as otherwise specifically provided in Section 6.7, this Agreement (including the documents and instruments referred to herein) is not intended to confer upon any person other than the parties hereto any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the parties. Any inaccuracies in such representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance herewith without notice or liability to any other person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto. Consequently, persons other than the parties may not rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any other date. 

  

    
 9.10 _Specific Performance_.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof (including the parties\' obligation to consummate the Merger), in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the parties hereby further waives (a) any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (b) any requirement under any law to post security or a bond as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 

  

  

 9.11 _Severability_.   Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision or portion of any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any provision in such jurisdiction, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction such that the invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision or portion thereof shall be interpreted to be only so broad as is enforceable. 

  

    
 9.12 _Confidential Supervisory Information_.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no disclosure, representation or warranty shall be made (or other action taken) pursuant to this Agreement that would involve the disclosure of confidential supervisory information (including confidential supervisory information as defined in 12 C.F.R. § 261.2(c) and as identified in 12 C.F.R. § 309.5(g)(8)) of a Governmental Entity by any party to this Agreement to the extent prohibited by applicable law. To the extent legally permissible, appropriate substitute disclosures or actions shall be made or taken under circumstances in which the limitations of the preceding sentence apply. 

        

    
 9.13 _Delivery by Facsimile or Electronic Transmission_.  This Agreement and any signed agreement or instrument entered into in connection with this Agreement, and any amendments or waivers hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file to deliver a signature to this Agreement or any amendment hereto or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or e-mail delivery of a ".pdf" format data file as a defense to the formation of a contract and each party hereto forever waives any such defense.
