good faith estimate of Net Working Capital (the "Estimated Net Working

Working Capital, and such amount shall be adjusted in response to any
reasonable comments of Buyer provided prior to the Closing. At the
Closing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)If the (A) Estimated Net Working Capital is less than (B) the Net
Working Capital Target, the amount due under Section 2.4(c) shall be reduced
by such difference; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)If the (A) Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than (B) the
Net Working Capital Target, the amount due under Section 2.4(c) shall be
increased by such difference. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Closing Schedule. On or before the date that is 90 days following

Schedule") and shall deliver the Closing Schedule to Seller. \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Protest Notice. On or prior to the date which is 30 days after
Buyer's delivery of the Closing Schedule (the "Protest Date"), Seller may
deliver written notice to Buyer (the "Protest Notice") setting forth any
objections which Seller may have to the Closing Schedule. The Protest Notice

therefor and shall include a schedule setting forth Seller's determination of
Net Working Capital. If a Protest Notice is not delivered prior to the Protest
Date, the Net Working Capital as set forth on the Closing Schedule shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by Seller Parties. If a Protest Notice is
delivered prior to the Protest Date, any amounts not disputed therein shall be
final, binding and non-appealable by Seller Parties. Upon receipt of the
Closing Schedule, Seller and its accountants will be given reasonable access
upon reasonable notice to Buyer's relevant books, records, workpapers and
personnel during business hours for the purpose of verifying Net Working
Capital. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Resolution of the Protest. If Buyer and Seller are unable to
resolve any disagreement with respect to the Closing Schedule within 30 days
following Buyer's receipt of the Protest Notice, then only the amounts in
dispute will be referred to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP or, if such firm is
engaged by Buyer or any Seller Party for audit or accounting services, or
unable or unwilling to act, such other public accounting firm as shall be
agreed in writing by Seller and Buyer (the "Accountants") for final
determination within 45 days after such referral. The determination by the
Accountants of the amounts in dispute shall be based solely on presentations
by Buyer and Seller, and shall not involve the Accountants' independent
review. Any determination by the Accountants shall not be outside the range
defined by the respective amounts in the Closing Schedule proposed by Buyer
and Seller's proposed adjustments thereto set forth in the Protest Notice, and
absent manifest mathematical error such determination shall be final, binding
and non-appealable on the Parties. Each of Buyer and Seller shall execute and
deliver a customary engagement letter as may be requested by the Accountants,
and each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear
that percentage of the fees and expenses of the Accountants equal to the
proportion (expressed as a percentage and determined by the Accountants) of
the dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other
party by the Accountants. For purposes of this Agreement, "Final Net Working
Capital" means Net Working Capital as finally determined pursuant to this
Section 2.5. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)If (A) the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than (B) the

instruction to the Escrow Agent to disburse to Buyer the amount of such
difference from the Escrow Fund; provided, however, that if the amount of the
Escrow Fund as of such date is less than, or would by virtue of such
disbursement become less than, the sum of (x) $7,927,500, plus (y) the
aggregate amount of the Reserve (as defined in the Escrow Agreement) as of
such date, such difference or the portion thereof that would reduce the Escrow
Fund below such threshold shall be paid to the Buyer by the Seller directly;
and \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t17  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)If (A) the Estimated Net Working Capital is less than (B) the

days after such referral. The determination by the Accountant of the amounts

deliver a customary engagement letter as may be requested by the Accountant,
and each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, shall bear
that percentage of the fees and expenses of the Accountant equal to the
proportion (expressed as a percentage and determined by the Accountant) of the
dollar value of the disputed amounts determined in favor of the other party by
the Accountant. \t\t

Buyer's election in its sole discretion, by delivery of cash or Buyer Shares
or any combination of cash and Buyer Shares.  \t\t

reasonably acceptable to Seller verifying registration of such Buyer Shares in
the name of Seller by book entry, bearing the legend or restrictive notation
set forth in Section 4.26(f). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(C)Any such Buyer Shares will be issued in reliance upon an applicable
exemption for registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"). Buyer's obligation to deliver the Buyer Shares will be
conditioned upon Seller's delivery to Buyer of, and Seller hereby covenants

delivered by Seller, dated the date of the delivery of the Buyer Shares,
stating that the representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.26 are

trailing three (3) month basis at or above ***%, (2) EBITDA margins (which
shall be calculated by dividing (x) the sum of Adjusted EBITDA plus Buyer
Brand Gross Profit by (y) the sum of the revenue of the Business plus the net
revenue of the Buyer Brand Business) on a trailing three month basis at or
above ***%, and (3) capital expenditures as a percentage of revenue consistent

of the Earnout Period, the Seller Parties covenant and agree that Owner shall
at all times exercise voting control of Seller and that all equity interests

his immediate family members.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Clawback. The Earnout Amount paid to Seller shall be subject to
clawback from any Seller Party by Buyer if (i) the calculation of such Earnout
Amount was based on calculations of the Earnout Adjusted EBITDA and/or

directly or indirectly attributable to fraud or intentional misrepresentation
(but not negligent misrepresentation) of Owner or any employee of Buyer or any
of its subsidiaries acting at the direction of Owner as determined in a final
adjudication determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. Upon any such
determination, the Seller Parties shall be jointly and severally obligated to
return to Buyer the portion of the Earnout Amount that is attributable to the
inaccuracy giving rise to such determination.  \t\t

adjustment thereto to the Purchased Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of

prepare the draft Allocation, and in  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t23  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

the event that Seller is in agreement with the Allocation then the Allocation
should be final and shall be binding upon Buyer and each Seller Party for all
U.S. federal, state and local income Tax purposes. Buyer and each Seller Party
shall timely and properly report the sale of the Purchased Assets in a manner
consistent with the final Allocation (including, but not limited to the
preparation of Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) and shall not take any
position in connection with any income Tax audit or contest that is
inconsistent with the Allocation. In the case of any subsequent adjustment to
the Purchase Price or any other relevant item of consideration requiring an
amendment to the final Allocation, Buyer shall prepare an amended Allocation
taking into account such adjustment to the Purchase Price or any other
relevant item of consideration, and Buyer and each Seller Party shall file
amended Forms 8594 consistent with such amended Allocation. Each Seller Party
shall timely deliver all such documents and other information as Buyer may
reasonably request in order to prepare the Allocation. However, if Buyer and
Seller are unable to agree on the Allocation within 30 days of the delivery of
the draft Allocation to Seller, each of Buyer and Seller may file Form 8594
and any Tax Returns allocating the Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets
in a manner each believes appropriate, provided such allocation is reasonable
and in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code. Buyer and Seller hereby
agree that no more than $25,000 of the Purchase Price shall be specifically
allocated as payment for any non-competition, non-solicitation or other
restrictive covenants of Seller or Owner. Seller Parties agree that such
special allocation of the Purchase Price is for tax purposes only, and shall
not for any purpose be used (i) when considering the enforceability of any
such covenants or (ii) as a measure of, and shall be irrelevant to any
determination of, any Adverse Consequences resulting from the breach of any
such covenants or otherwise. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.4No Violation. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.4, the execution,

connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.6Financial Statements and Financial Data. \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t26  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Attached as Exhibit A are copies of the following financial
statements of Seller (collectively, the "Financial Statements"): \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)the unaudited balance sheet of Seller as of December 31, 2014 and
2015 and the related unaudited statements of operations, comprehensive income,
changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the years then
ended; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)the unaudited balance sheet of Seller as of March 31, 2016 (the
"Balance Sheet"), and the related unaudited statements of operations,
comprehensive income, changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows for the
3-month period then ended. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) (i) except as
set forth on Schedule 4.6(a), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied throughout the periods covered thereby, except that the
interim Financial Statements are subject to normal year-end adjustments and
lack footnotes required by GAAP, (ii) present fairly the assets, liabilities
and financial condition of Seller as of such dates and the results of
operations of Seller for such periods, and (iii) are consistent with the books
and records of Seller (which books and records are correct and complete in all
material respects). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)All notes and accounts receivable of Seller are reflected properly
on the books and records of Seller, are valid receivables subject to no
setoffs or counterclaims, and are current and collectible subject to the
reserve for bad debts set forth on the Balance Sheet as adjusted for the
passage of time through the Closing Date in accordance with the past custom
and practice of Seller. The accounts payable and accruals of Seller have
arisen in bona fide arm's-length transactions in the ordinary course of
business, and Seller has been paying its accounts payable as and when
due. \t\t

4.7Absence of Undisclosed Liabilities \t\t

 \t\t\t. Seller does not have any material Liabilities, except (a) as and to
the extent specifically accrued for or reserved against in the Balance Sheet;
(b) Liabilities which have arisen after the date of the Balance Sheet in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice (none of which
results from, arises out of, relates to, is in the nature of, or was caused by
any breach of contract, breach of warranty, tort, infringement or violation of
Law); (c) executory obligations under a Contract (other than liabilities
relating to any breach, or any fact or circumstance that, with notice, lapse
of time or both, would result in a breach, thereof by Seller); and (d)
Liabilities specifically set forth on Schedule 4.7. \t\t

4.8Absence of Changes or Events \t\t

 \t\t\t. Since September 30, 2015 (the "Reference Date"), no Event has
occurred that, individually or in combination with any other Events, has had
or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed in Schedule 4.8, since the Reference Date, Seller has conducted the
Business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, except as disclosed in Schedule 4.8,
since Reference Date, Seller has not taken any action that, if taken after the
date of this Agreement, would constitute a breach of any of the covenants set
forth in Section 6.1 (excluding Section 6.1(l)). \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t27  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.9Assets. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Seller owns good and marketable title to, or a valid right to use,
all of the Purchased Assets, free and clear of any and all Liens other than
Permitted Liens (except, in each case, any of the Purchased Assets that
constitute Intellectual Property, which are separately set forth in Section
4.10). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)All items of tangible personal property included the Purchased
Assets with a replacement value greater than $10,000 are in good operating
condition and repair, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and are suitable for
the purposes for which they are presently being used. None of the tangible
personal or movable property constituting Purchased Assets is located other
than at the Leased Real Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)The Purchased Assets are sufficient to enable the Business to be
conducted by Buyer immediately after the Closing in the same manner as the
Business has been conducted since the Reference Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.10Proprietary Rights. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Schedule 4.10(a) contains a true, correct and complete list of all
Seller Registered Intellectual Property that includes (i) the jurisdictions in
which such item of Seller Registered Intellectual Property has been registered
or filed, the applicable registration or serial number, date of filing,
identifying information such as title or mark, and status; and (ii) each
product or service identified in Schedule 4.10(c) that embodies, utilizes or
is based upon or derived from (or, with respect to products and services under
development that is expected to embody, utilize or be based upon or derived
from) such item of Seller Registered Intellectual Property. All Seller
Registered Intellectual Property (other than applications therefore) is valid,
subsisting and enforceable, and all necessary application, registration,
maintenance and renewal fees currently due in connection with all Seller
Registered Intellectual Property have been made and all necessary documents,
recordations and certifications in connection with all Seller Registered
Intellectual Property have been filed with the relevant Governmental
Authorities for the purpose of maintaining and recording title for such Seller
Registered Intellectual Property. Seller has not licensed any trademarks,
service marks, or other source identifiers included among the Seller
Registered Intellectual Property to any third party. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)all Seller Registered Intellectual Property owned or purported to
be owned by Seller is and at all times has been in compliance with all Laws,
and all filings, payments and other actions required to be made or taken to
maintain such item of Seller Registered Intellectual Property in full force
and effect have been made by the applicable deadline and for payments, at the
correct rates; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Schedule 4.10(a)(ii) accurately identifies each filing, payment or
action that is due or must be made or taken on or before the date that is
sixty (60) days after the date hereof in order to maintain each such item of
Seller Registered Intellectual Property in full force and effect; \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t28  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iii)Seller has made available to Buyer complete and accurate copies
of all material: applications, filings, correspondence and other material
documents related to each such item of Seller Registered Intellectual
Property; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(iv)no interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination, review or
other Proceeding of any nature is or has been pending or, to Seller's
Knowledge, threatened, in which the scope, validity or enforceability of any
Seller Registered Intellectual Property or any Intellectual Property embodied
therein is being, has been or could reasonably be expected to be contested or
challenged. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Seller exclusively owns all right, title and interest in and to all
Intellectual Property used in connection with the operation and conduct of its
business, free and clear of any Liens (other than Permitted Liens), other than
Intellectual Property that is licensed to Seller as identified in Schedule
4.10(d) or Intellectual Property that is licensed to Seller and not required
to be identified in Schedule 4.10(d). Seller's Patents that are pending
currently correctly name as inventors all Persons who are the true inventors
of Seller's Patents. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Schedule 4.10(c) sets forth a true, correct and complete list of
each proprietary product or service developed, licensed, manufactured,
marketed or sold by Seller, including the Seller Proprietary Software. No
portion of the Seller Proprietary Software contains, embodies, uses, copies,
comprises or requires the work of any third party that Seller does not own, or
has not validly and correctly licensed from the true owner. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Schedule 4.10(d) accurately identifies (i) all Intellectual
Property licensed to Seller (other than any non-customized Software that (A)
is so licensed solely in executable or object code form pursuant to a non-
exclusive, internal use software license; (B) is not incorporated into, or
used directly in the distribution of, Seller's products or services; and (C)
is generally available on standard terms for less than $10,000); (ii) the
corresponding Contract or Contracts pursuant to which such Intellectual
Property is licensed to Seller; and (iii) whether the license or licenses
granted to Seller are exclusive, sole or non-exclusive. No royalties, fees,
honoraria, volume-based, milestone or other payments are payable by Seller and
no obligations are owed to any Person by reason of the ownership, use, sale,
licensing, distribution or other exploitation of any Intellectual Property
relating to the conduct or operation of the Business or the delivery or
provision of the its products or services other than pursuant to the Contracts
identified in Schedule 4.10(d).  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Schedule 4.10(e) accurately identifies each Contract pursuant to
which any Person has been granted any license under, or otherwise has received
or acquired any right (whether or not currently exercisable) or interest in,
any Seller Owned Intellectual Property (other than non-exclusive object code
Software licenses granted to end user customers and involving payments to
Seller in the ordinary course of business pursuant to Seller's standard form
of license agreement and in an amount or having a value of less than $10,000).
Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10(e), Seller is not bound by, and no Seller
Owned Intellectual Property is subject to, any Contract containing any
covenant or other provision that in any way limits or restricts the ability of
Seller to use, exploit, assert or enforce any Seller Owned Intellectual
Property, in each case anywhere in the world. Seller has not assigned or
otherwise transferred  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t29  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

ownership of, or agreed to assign or otherwise transfer ownership of, any
Seller Owned Intellectual Property to any Person.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Seller has provided to Buyer a complete and accurate copy of each
standard form of Contract relating to Seller Owned Intellectual Property used
by Seller at any time in the last two years, including, without limitation,
each standard form of (i) license agreement; (ii) distributor or reseller
agreement; (iii) employee agreement containing intellectual property
assignment or license of Intellectual Property or any confidentiality
provision; (iv) consulting or independent contractor agreement containing
intellectual property assignment or license of Intellectual Property or any
confidentiality provision; (v) confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement,
(vi) support and maintenance contract; (vii) professional services agreement;
and (viii) escrow agreement. Schedule 4.10(f) accurately identifies each
Contract relating to Seller Owned Intellectual Property that deviates in any
material respect from the corresponding standard form agreement provided to
Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)All Seller Owned Intellectual Property was developed by employees,
agents, consultants, contractors or other Persons who have executed valid and
enforceable instruments of assignment in favor of Seller as assignee that have
conveyed to Seller ownership of all Intellectual Property rights in the Seller
Owned Intellectual Property. No current or former shareholder, officer,
director or employee has any claim, right (whether or not currently
exercisable), or interest to or in any Seller Owned Intellectual Property. To
the extent that any Intellectual Property has been developed or created by a
third party for Seller, Seller has a written agreement with such third party
with respect thereto and Seller thereby either (i) has obtained ownership of
and is the exclusive owner of, or (ii) has obtained a license (sufficient for
the conduct of its business as currently conducted) to, all of such third
party's Intellectual Property rights in such work, material or invention by
operation of law or by valid assignment. No employee is, to Seller's
Knowledge, in breach of any Contract with any former employer or other Person
concerning Intellectual Property or confidentiality. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)No funding, facilities or personnel of any Governmental Authority
were used to develop or create, in whole or in part, any Seller Owned
Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Seller is not and has not been a member or promoter of, or a
contributor to, any industry standards body or similar organization that could
require or obligate Seller to grant or offer to any other Person any license
or right to any Seller Owned Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j)None of Seller or any of its products or services has infringed
upon (directly, contributorily, by inducement or otherwise), misappropriated
or otherwise violated, or is infringing upon (directly, contributorily, by
inducement or otherwise), misappropriating or otherwise violating, the
Intellectual Property of any third party. To Seller's Knowledge, no Person has
infringed upon, misappropriated or violated, or is infringing upon,
misappropriating or violating, any Seller Owned Intellectual Property.
Schedule 4.10(j) accurately identifies (and Seller has provided to Buyer a
true, complete and accurate copy of) each letter or other written
communication or correspondence that has been sent or otherwise delivered in
the last 4 years by or to Seller, and each document of any kind created within
Seller with or without any such letter, communication or correspondence,
regarding any actual, alleged or suspected infringement or  \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t30  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

misappropriation of any Intellectual Property, and provides a brief
description of the current status of the matter referred to in such letter,
communication or correspondence. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k)Neither the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement or
any Transaction Document nor the consummation of any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement any Transaction Document will, with or without
notice or lapse of time (or both), result in, or give any other Person the
right or option to cause or declare: (i) a loss of, or Lien (other than a
Permitted Lien) on, any Intellectual Property; (ii) a breach of any license
agreement listed or required to be listed in Schedule 4.10(d); (iii) the
release, disclosure, or delivery of any Seller Owned Intellectual Property by
or to any escrow agent or other Person; or (iv) the grant, assignment, or
transfer to any other Person of any license or other right or interest under,
to, or in any of the Seller Owned Intellectual Property. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l)None of the Seller Proprietary Software nor, to Seller's Knowledge,
any other product, system or service of Seller, (i) contains any bug, defect
or error (including any bug, defect, or error relating to or resulting from
the display, manipulation, processing, storage, transmission or use of date
data) that materially and adversely affects the use, functionality or
performance of such Seller Proprietary Software or any product or system
containing or used in conjunction with such Seller Proprietary Software; or
(ii) fails to comply with any applicable warranty or other contractual
commitment relating to the use, functionality or performance of such Seller
Proprietary Software or any product or system containing or used in
conjunction with such Seller Proprietary Software. Seller has provided to
Buyer a true, complete and correct list of all known and material: bugs,
defects and errors in each version and component of the Seller Proprietary
Software.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m)No Seller Proprietary Software nor, to Seller's Knowledge, any
other product, system or service of Seller, contains any "back door," "drop
dead device," "time bomb," "Trojan horse," "virus," or "worm" (as such terms
are commonly understood in the software industry) or any other code designed
or intended to have, or capable of performing, any of the following functions:
(i) disrupting, disabling, harming or otherwise impeding in any manner the
operation of, or providing unauthorized access to, a computer system or
network or other device on which such code is stored or installed; or (ii)
damaging or destroying any data or file without the user's consent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(n)None of the source code of Seller has been delivered, licensed,
published or disclosed by Seller, except pursuant to a written non-disclosure
agreement that is in the standard form used by Seller or similar agreement
requiring the recipient to keep such source code or trade secrets
confidential, or, to Seller's Knowledge, by any third party to any other third
party except pursuant to licenses or other Contracts requiring such third
party to keep such trade secrets confidential. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(n), no portion of the
source code for any Software ever owned, developed, used, or distributed by
Seller has been delivered, disclosed, licensed or made available to any escrow
agent or other Person and there are no contracts in existence that would
permit, facilitate or provide any such disclosure or license. Except as set
forth in Schedule 4.10(n), (i) Seller does not have any duty or obligation
(whether present, contingent or otherwise) to deliver, license or make
available the source code for any Seller Proprietary Software to any escrow
agent or other Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an
employee, and (ii) no event has occurred,  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t31  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

and no circumstance or condition exists, that (with or without notice or lapse
of time or both) will, or could reasonably be expected to, result in the
delivery, license or disclosure of the source code for any Seller Proprietary
Software to any other Person who is not, as of the date of this Agreement, an
Employee. Except as set forth in Schedule 4.10(n), source code in respect of
any of the Seller Proprietary Software has never been removed from Seller's
premises, and has never been disclosed, licensed, transferred or released to
any Person other than disclosures to those of its employees and contractors
having "a need to know" in connection with the development, modification or
support of the products and services of Seller. Except for licensed customers
of Seller, no Person has been provided a copy of the object code of any of the
Seller Proprietary Software by Seller.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(o)No Seller Proprietary Software is subject to any "copyleft" or
other obligation or condition (including any obligation or condition under any
"open source" license such as the GNU Public License, Lesser GNU Public
License or Mozilla Public License) that (i) does require, or does condition
the use or distribution of such Seller Proprietary Software on, the
disclosure, licensing or distribution of any source code for any portion of
such Seller Proprietary Software, or (ii) does otherwise impose any
limitation, restriction or condition on the right or ability of Seller to use
or distribute any Seller Proprietary Software. There is no material
obligation, term or provision of any such "open source" license that Seller
has not performed. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(p)Except as set forth on Schedule 4.10(p), all of the systems used by
Seller in connection with the operation of its business are maintained and
operated exclusively by Seller and are not wholly or partly dependent on any
facilities or means (including any electronic, mechanical or photographic
process, computerized or otherwise) which are not under the exclusive
ownership and control of Seller. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(q)The computer systems, including the Software, hardware and networks
(collectively, the "Systems"), currently used by Seller are sufficient for the
current needs of the Business, including as to capacity and ability to process
current peak volumes in a timely manner. In the past twelve (12) months, there
have been no material bugs in, or failures, breakdowns, or continued
substandard performance of, any Systems that has caused the substantial
disruption or interruption in or to the use of such Systems by Seller or the
conduct of the Business. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(r)The material trade secrets included in the Purchased Assets are all
of the trade secrets necessary to enable the Business to be conducted by Buyer
immediately after the Closing in the same manner as the Business has been
conducted since the Reference Date. Seller has taken reasonable steps to
maintain the confidentiality of and otherwise protect its rights in such trade
secrets and there has not been any disclosure by Seller of any such trade
secrets. Seller has taken reasonable steps to maintain the confidentiality of
and otherwise protect its rights in all Confidential Information and any trade
secret or confidential information of third parties used by Seller, and,
except under confidentiality obligations, there has not been any disclosure by
Seller of any Confidential Information or any such trade secret or
confidential information of third parties.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t4.11Contracts. Schedule 4.11(a) is a correct and complete list (by
reference to the applicable subsection hereof) of (i) all Contracts that
require Seller to pay, or entitle Seller to  \t\t \t\t

accordance with its terms, and is not subject to any claims, charges, set offs
or defenses, in each case with respect to Seller, and to Seller's Knowledge,
with respect to any other party thereto. Except as set forth on Schedule
4.11(b), Seller is not in breach or default, nor has any event occurred which
with the giving of notice or the passage of time or both would constitute a
breach or default by Seller of, or which would give rise to any right of
notice, modification, acceleration, payment, cancellation or termination of or

under, any Contract. No Seller Party has been notified by any counterparty to

foregoing. Seller Parties agree to notify Buyer immediately if any Person
makes any proposal, offer, inquiry or contact with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal and, to the extent permitted by non-disclosure agreements entered
into prior to the date hereof, provide Buyer with a description of the
material terms and conditions thereof, including the identity of such Person.

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.1Restrictive Covenants. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Confidentiality. From and after the Closing Date, each Seller Party
and its Affiliates will refrain from using or disclosing, and will take all
commercially reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of,
any Confidential Information. In the event that a Seller Party reasonably
believes after consultation with counsel that such Seller Party or its
Affiliate is required by applicable Law to disclose any Confidential
Information, such Seller Party or Affiliate may disclose only such
Confidential Information as may be legally required, provided that it (i)
provides Buyer with prompt notice before such disclosure so that Buyer may
attempt to obtain a protective order or other assurance that confidential
treatment will be accorded to such Confidential Information and (ii)
cooperates with Buyer in attempting to obtain such order or assurance. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Non-Competition. Each Seller Party covenants and agrees that during
the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending upon the third (3rd)
anniversary of the Closing Date (the "Term") such Person and its Affiliates
will not, directly or indirectly, engage or participate in any manner (as an
owner, equity holder, financing source, director, manager, officer, employee,
agent, representative, consultant, service provider or otherwise) in any
business that is or may be competitive with the Business (or any portion
thereof) anywhere in the United States, Canada and/or any other jurisdiction
in the world in  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t50  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

which the Business is conducted as of the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 7.1(b) shall prohibit any Seller
Party or its Affiliates from the passive ownership of less than two percent
(2%) of any class of stock listed on a national securities exchange or traded
in the over-the-counter market.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Non-Solicitation of Business Relationships. Without limiting the
generality of the provisions of Section 7.1(b) above, each Seller Party hereby
covenants and agrees that during the Term such Person and its Affiliates will
not, directly or indirectly, solicit, or participate in any manner (as an
owner, equity holder, financing source, director, manager, officer, employee,
agent, representative, consultant, service provider or otherwise) in any
business that solicits, any Person that is or was a customer, supplier or
other business relation of Seller or the Business at any time during the
24-month period prior to the Closing Date for purposes of diverting such
Person's business from Buyer or the Business or providing any goods or
services which are or may be competitive with those provided by Buyer or the
Business. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Non-Solicitation of Employees and Contractors. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)Each Seller Party hereby covenants and agrees that during the Term
such Person and its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for
employment or engagement as an independent contractor any individual that
served as an employee or independent contractor of Seller or the Business as
of the date hereof, except (A) pursuant to a general solicitation that is not
directed specifically to such employees or independent contractors and (B) to
the extent such individual ceases to serve as an employee or independent
contractor of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (provided that there was no
solicitation prior to such cessation). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(ii)Each Seller Party hereby covenants and agrees that during the Term
such Person and its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, employ or
engage as an independent contractor any individual that served as an employee
or independent contractor of Seller or the Business as of the date hereof,
except to the extent such individual ceases to serve as an employee or
independent contractor of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (provided that there
was no solicitation prior to such cessation). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Non-Disparagement. Each Seller Party hereby covenants and agrees
that such Person and its Affiliates will not, directly or indirectly, make any
derogatory or disparaging statement or communication regarding Buyer, the
Business or any of its employees. Nothing in this Section 7.1(e) shall limit
any Seller Party's or its Affiliate's ability to make true and accurate
statements or communications in connection with any disclosure such Seller
Party or its Affiliates reasonably believe is required pursuant to applicable
Law. Buyer hereby agrees to instruct the members of the Board of Directors of
Buyer and officers of Buyer who are subject to the requirements of Section 16
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to not, directly or indirectly, make
any derogatory or disparaging statement or communication regarding any Seller
Party. Nothing in this Section 7.1(e) shall limit any such Person's ability
to make true and accurate statements or communications in connection with any
disclosure such Person reasonably believes is required pursuant to applicable
Law. \t\t

the geographic area covered shall be deemed to comprise the largest territory
permissible by Law under the circumstances and the scope shall be as broad as

agrees that (i) the covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 7.1
were a material inducement to Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to

the bargain set forth in this Agreement as specifically negotiated by the
Parties if such Seller Party or any of its Affiliates breached the provisions
of this Section 7.1, (iii) any breach of the provisions of this Section 7.1
by such Seller Party or its Affiliates would result in a significant loss of
goodwill by Buyer and the Business, (iv) the Purchase Price is sufficient

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)After the Closing, Seller Parties, on the one hand, and Buyer, on

notice that he, she or it receives of any audit, investigation, request for
documents or information related to Taxes that could affect the Tax liability

 \t\t

administrative Proceeding relating to liability for Taxes, (iii) will each
retain and, at the other Party's expense, provide to the other Party all
records and other information that may be relevant to any such Tax Return,
audit or examination, proceeding or determination and (iv) will each provide
the other Party with any final determination of any such audit or examination,
proceeding or determination that affects any amount required to be shown on
any Tax Return of the other Party for any period. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Seller Parties and Buyer will retain,
until the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation (including any
extensions thereof), copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work schedules and
other records relating to tax periods or portions thereof of Seller ending on
or prior to the Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)For all purposes under this Agreement involving the determination
of Taxes (including the determination of Seller Taxes), in the case of Taxes
that are payable with respect to any Taxable period that includes but does not
end on the Closing Date, the portion of any such Tax that is allocable to the
portion of such Taxable period ending on the Closing shall be (i) in the case
of Taxes imposed on a periodic basis with respect to any assets or otherwise
measured by the level of any item (without regard for income, gross receipts,
payroll, sales or use), deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire
Taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number
of calendar days in the Taxable period ending on the close of the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Taxable period, and (ii) in the case of income, gross receipts, sales, use and
all other Taxes, deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the
Taxable period ended at the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)All Transfer Taxes shall be paid one-half by Seller and one-half by
Buyer when due. The responsible party shall timely file or caused to be filed
all necessary documents (including all Tax Returns) with respect to such
Transfer Taxes. If a party makes a payment for which it is entitled to
reimbursement under this Section 7.2(c) from the other party, such other party
shall reimburse the paying party promptly but in no event later than ten (10)
Business Days after the presentation of a statement setting forth the amount
of reimbursement to which the paying party is entitled. Buyer and Seller will
use their commercially reasonable efforts to minimize any Transfer Taxes,
including the transfer via electronic transmission of all assets capable of
being so transmitted. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.3Payment of Excluded Liabilities. After the Closing, Seller agrees
to pay in full and discharge all of the Excluded Liabilities in the ordinary
course consistent with past practice and in any event, in accordance with
their stated terms, if applicable. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall
fund all amounts with respect to checks written or ACH or similar withdrawals
authorized by Seller but not cleared prior to 12:01 a.m. Pacific time on the
Closing Date. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.4Accounts Receivable. All payments and reimbursements made after
12:01 a.m. Pacific time on the Closing Date in the name of or to Seller in
connection with or arising out of the Business, shall be held by Seller in
trust for the benefit of Buyer, and within 5 days after receipt by Seller of
any such payment or reimbursement, Seller shall pay over to Buyer the amount
of such payment or reimbursement, together with all corresponding notes,
documentation and information received in connection therewith. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.5Nonassignable Contracts. To the extent that the assignment
hereunder by Seller to Buyer of any Contract is not permitted or is not
permitted without the consent of any other party to such Contract, this
Agreement and the Transaction Documents shall not be deemed to constitute an
assignment of any such Contract if such consent is not given or if such
assignment otherwise would constitute a breach of, or cause a loss of
contractual benefits under, any such Contract, and Buyer shall assume no
Liabilities under any such Contract. Without in any way limiting Seller's
obligation to obtain all consents and waivers necessary for the assignment of
the Contracts to Buyer hereunder, if any such consent is not obtained or if
such assignment is not permitted irrespective of consent, Seller Parties shall
cooperate with Buyer following the Closing in any reasonable arrangement
designed to provide Buyer with the rights and benefits (subject to the
obligations) under any such Contract, including enforcement for the benefit of
Buyer of any and all rights of Seller against any other party arising out of
any such Contract by such other party and, if requested by Buyer, acting as an
agent on behalf of Buyer or as Buyer shall otherwise reasonably require. With
respect to any such Contract, following the Closing each Seller Party shall
continue use commercially reasonable efforts (or in the case of Contracts with
parties other than credit card issuers, best efforts) to obtain such consents
or waivers. Upon the receipt of any such consent or waiver, Seller shall
promptly assign such Contract to Buyer for no additional consideration.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.6Employee and Related Matters. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Transferred Employees. Effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall offer employment to all employees of Seller set forth on Schedule 7.6
(the "Business Employees"). Business Employees who accept Buyer's offer of
employment and become employees of Buyer shall be referred to herein as the
"Transferred Employees." Seller Parties agree that Buyer shall have no
Liability whatsoever (including under Section 4980B of the Code) with respect
to any Business Employee who is offered employment but who does not become a
Transferred Employee, and Seller shall retain, bear and discharge all
Liabilities with respect to all employees and former employees of Seller who
are not Business Employees or do not become Transferred Employees (including
liabilities under Section 4980B of the Code). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Employee Benefit Plans. Buyer shall not assume and shall have no
Liability whatsoever, and Seller shall retain, bear and discharge all
Liabilities, under each Employee Benefit Plan. Without limiting the foregoing,
Seller shall retain all Liability for providing group health continuation
coverage under Code Section 4980B and Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
for all MandA Qualified Beneficiaries within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
54.4980B-9, Q/A-4(a) who experience a qualifying event within the meaning
Treasury Regulation 54.4980B-9, Q/A-6. Seller shall and shall cause its
Affiliates to take all actions necessary to prevent Buyer from becoming a
"successor employer" under Treasury Regulation 54.4980B-9, Q/A-8(c)(1). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Payroll Obligations. No later than the first date following the
Closing Date on which Seller would otherwise pay payroll in the ordinary
course, Seller shall pay to each Transferred Employee an amount equal to the
value of any salary, wages, bonus and, to the extent required by applicable
Law, vacation, sick pay and other paid time off (as applicable) owed to or
accrued by such Transferred Employee through and including the Closing Date,
net  \t\t

of any applicable withholding (and Seller shall pay to the applicable taxing
authority any employer and employee side payroll Taxes payable as a result
thereof). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Mutual Cooperation. Seller shall provide promptly to Buyer, at
Buyer's reasonable request, any information or copies of personnel records
(including addresses, dates of birth, dates of hire and dependent information)
relating to the Transferred Employees or relating to the service of
Transferred Employees with Seller prior to the Closing Date. Seller and Buyer
shall each cooperate with the other and shall provide to the other such
documentation, information and assistance as is reasonably necessary to effect
the provisions of this Section 7.6. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.7Further Assurances; Transition Assistance.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Each of the Parties shall execute and deliver such further
instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such additional action as the
other may reasonably request to effect, consummate, confirm or evidence the
transfer to Buyer of the Purchased Assets, the assumption by Buyer of the
Assumed Liabilities and the conduct by Buyer of the Business, and shall
execute such documents as may be necessary to assist Buyer in preserving or
perfecting its rights in the Purchased Assets and its ability to conduct the
Business. Seller Parties agree that subsequent to the Closing they shall refer
all inquiries from customers, vendors or suppliers with respect to the
Business to Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Without limiting the generality of Section 7.7(b), after the
Closing, each of Owner and Seller agrees that he or it shall use best efforts
to promptly take all such actions as may be requested by Buyer from time to
time to cause all trade secrets, know-how and other Intellectual Property
included in the Purchased Assets to (i) be sufficiently documented to allow
its full and proper use without reliance on the special knowledge or memory of
Owner or any other Person and (ii) be sufficiently explained and demonstrated
to such Persons as the Buyer may direct to allow its full and proper use
without reliance on the special knowledge or memory of Owner or any other
Person. Each Seller Party acknowledges and agrees that (i) the covenants and
agreements set forth in this Section 7.7(b) were a material inducement to
Buyer to enter into this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder,
(ii) Buyer would not obtain the benefit of the bargain set forth in this
Agreement as specifically negotiated by the Parties if such Seller Party
breached the provisions of this Section 7.7(b), and (iii) any breach of the
provisions of this Section 7.7(b) by such Seller Party would result in a
significant loss of goodwill by Buyer and the Business and the failure by
Buyer to receive the benefit of such trade secrets, know-how and other
Intellectual Property included in the Purchased Assets. Each Seller Party
further acknowledges and agrees that irreparable injury will result to Buyer
if such Seller Party breaches any of the terms of this Section 7.7(b), and
that in the event of an actual or threatened breach by such Seller Party of
any of the provisions contained in this Section 7.7(b), Buyer will have no
adequate remedy at Law. Each Seller Party accordingly agrees that in the
event of any actual or threatened breach by such Seller Party of any of the
provisions contained in this Section 7.7(b), Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive and other equitable relief without (i) the posting of any bond or
other security, (ii) the necessity of showing actual damages and (iii) the
necessity of showing that monetary damages are an inadequate remedy. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed as prohibiting Buyer from pursuing any
other remedies available to it for such breach or threatened breach, including
the recovery of any damages that it is able to prove. \t\t

Closing, Buyer shall use the name "Next Advisor" and that such name is
included in the Purchased Assets hereunder. Immediately following the Closing,
Seller shall change its entity name (including any assumed or fictitious
names) from, and terminate all qualifications or other Permits in any
jurisdictions to do business as, "Next Advisor" to a name which is not
confusingly similar thereto, and after the Closing, Seller Parties shall not
use, and shall cause their Affiliates not to use, directly or indirectly, the
name "Next Advisor" or any other name which is confusingly similar thereto.
Seller Parties shall provide evidence of compliance with this Section 7.8 to
Buyer as promptly as practicable following the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.9Cooperation on Financial Statements. Seller Parties shall permit
Buyer and its representatives to contact Seller's accountants, auditors and
employees, and Seller Parties shall, and shall cause such accountants,
auditors and employees to, discuss, cooperate and provide information
reasonably requested by Buyer or its representatives, in order for Buyer to
prepare audited and unaudited historical financial statements for the
Purchased Assets and the Business and pro forma financial statements of Buyer,
in each case that meet the requirements of Regulation S-X promulgated under
the Securities Act and within the timeframe specified for Buyer to file such
financial statements on Form 8-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder.
Seller Parties shall, and shall cause Seller's accountants, auditors and
employees to, cooperate with Buyer with regards to responding to any comments
from the SEC on the financial statements of the Purchased Assets and the
Business. Buyer shall be responsible for and shall pay for or reimburse
Seller Parties for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses reasonably incurred by
Seller Parties in connection with the external audit of any such financial
statements (including reasonable accountants' fees) incurred at the Buyer's
request after the date hereof. The obligations of Seller Parties under this
Section 7.9 shall survive for three (3) years after the Closing. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.10Forfeiture of Purchase Price. In order to assure that Buyer
receives the benefit of the Business Employees, which are an integral part of
the Business and its goodwill, the Seller Parties agree that portions of the
Escrow Amount shall be forfeited and released to Buyer as follows: if Owner
ceases to be employed by Buyer and its Affiliates for any reason other than
termination of Owner's employment by Buyer without Cause or termination of
Owner's employment by Owner with Good Reason prior to the date that is 18
months after the Closing Date, the lesser of (x) $11,891,250 and (y) the
entire amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund (if any) shall, automatically
with no action required by any Seller Party, be disbursed to Buyer from the
Escrow Fund. To the extent that Buyer reports on any Tax Return any payment
made out of the Escrow Amount to Seller as wages (as defined in Section
3401(a) of the Code) (each, a "Wage Election"), Buyer shall make an additional
payment to Seller equal to the product of (i) such wages and (ii) 39%. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t7.11Public Announcements. No Party shall issue or cause the
publication of any press release or other public announcement relating to this
Agreement, any Transaction Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (whether before or after the Closing) without the prior written
consent of the Buyer and Seller, except as any Party believes in good faith is
required by applicable Law or by applicable rules of any stock exchange or
quotation system on which such Party or its Affiliates lists or trades
securities. \t\t

all respects on and as of the date hereof and at and as of the Closing as if
made on and as of the Closing Date (other than such representations and
warranties that are made as of a specified date, which representations and
warranties, disregarding all materiality, material adverse effect and similar
qualifications or exceptions contained therein, shall be true and correct in
all respects as of such date), except where the failure of any such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct, individually or in
combination with any other such failures, has not had and could not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on Buyer. \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Covenants and Agreements. Buyer shall have performed in all
material respects all of the covenants and agreements required to be performed

threatened by or before any Governmental Authority, that could reasonably be
expected to enjoin, prevent, restrain or delay consummation of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, declare unlawful any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or cause any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be rescinded following consummation. \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 9 
TERMINATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.1Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to
the Closing only as follows: \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)by the mutual written consent of Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)by Buyer if (i) at any time any of the representations or
warranties of a Seller Party in this Agreement is or becomes untrue or
inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) would not be
satisfied (treating such time as if it were the Closing for purposes of this
Section 9.1(b)) or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of a Seller Party
of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that
the condition set forth in Section 8.3(b) would not be satisfied (treating
such time as if it were the Closing for purposes of this Section 9.1(b)),
which breach cannot be cured by such Seller Party by the Outside Date or, if
capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days after
delivery of notice thereof by Buyer to Seller or any shorter period of time
that remains between the date Buyer delivers written notice of such breach to
Seller and the Outside Date; provided that Buyer shall not be entitled to
terminate pursuant to this Section 9.1(b) if such inaccuracy or breach was
primarily caused by the failure of Buyer to perform or comply in any material
respect with any of the covenants or agreements to be performed or complied
with by it prior to the Closing; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)by Seller if (i) at any time any of the representations or
warranties of Buyer in this Agreement is or becomes untrue or inaccurate such
that the condition set forth in Section 8.4(a) would not be satisfied
(treating such time as if it were the Closing for purposes of this Section
9.1(c)) or (ii) there has been a breach on the part of Buyer of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement such that the condition
set forth in Section 8.4(b) would  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t61  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

not be satisfied (treating such time as if it were the Closing for purposes of
this Section 9.1(c)), which breach cannot be cured by Buyer by the Outside
Date or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days
after delivery of notice thereof by Seller to Buyer or any shorter period of
time that remains between the date Seller delivers written notice of such
breach to Buyer and the Outside Date; provided that Seller shall not be
entitled to terminate pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) if such inaccuracy or
breach was primarily caused by the failure of any Seller Party to perform or
comply in any material respect with any of the covenants or agreements to be
performed or complied with by it prior to the Closing;

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)by either Buyer or Seller if the Closing has not occurred on or
before July 5, 2016 (the "Outside Date"); provided, that either Buyer or
Seller may, by written notice to the other, extend the Outside Date to
September 5, 2016 if, as of July 5, 2016, (i) the Antitrust Condition shall
not have been satisfied and (ii) all of the other conditions to the Closing
set forth in Article 8 shall have been satisfied or waived (other than the
conditions that, by their terms, are intended to be satisfied at the Closing,
which conditions only need to be capable of being satisfied at the
Closing); \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)by either Buyer or Seller if a Law is enacted, adopted, promulgated
or enforced that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
illegal or otherwise prohibited or if the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby would violate any Order of any Governmental Authority
having competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that the party seeking to
terminate shall not be entitled to terminate pursuant to this Section 9.1(e)
if the imposition of such Order or the failure of such Order to be resisted,
resolved or lifted, as applicable was primarily caused by the failure of Buyer
(if Buyer is seeking to terminate) or any Seller Party (if Seller is seeking
to terminate) to perform or comply in any material respect with any of the
covenants or agreements to be performed or complied with by it prior to the
Closing; or \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)by Buyer if since the effectiveness of this Agreement, an Event
has occurred or arisen that, individually or in combination with any other
Events, has had or could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tThe Party terminating this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1
(other than Section 9.1(a)) shall give prompt written notice of such
termination to the other Parties hereto. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t9.2Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement as provided above, this Agreement shall immediately terminate and
have no further force and effect and there shall be no Liability on the part
of any Party to any other Party under this Agreement, except that (a) the
covenants and agreements set forth in this Section 9.2 and Article 11
(Miscellaneous) and all definitions herein necessary to interpret any of the
foregoing provisions shall remain in full force and effect and survive such
termination indefinitely and (b) nothing in this Section 9.2 shall release any
Party from any Liability for any willful and material breach by such Party of
this Agreement before the effective date of such termination, or otherwise
affect any of the rights or remedies available to any Party with respect to
the breach of this Agreement by any Party before the effective date of such
termination. \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 10 
INDEMNIFICATION \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.1Survival. The representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained herein shall survive the Closing. The indemnification
obligations under Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 with respect to breaches of
representations and warranties shall continue (a) with respect to the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.1 (Authorization), 3.4
(No Brokers or Finders), 4.1 (Authorization; Organization; Good Standing), 4.2
(Capitalization), 4.5 (Brokers or Finders), 4.9(a) (Title), 4.20 (Transactions
With Related Parties), 5.1 (Buyer Organization), 5.2 (Authorization) and 5.5
(No Brokers or Finders), until the date that is 20 years after the Closing
Date, (b) with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 4.16 (Taxes), until 60 days after the statute of limitations (giving
effect to any waiver, mitigation or extension thereof) applicable to the
subject matter of such representations and warranties bars all claims with
respect to such subject matter, (c) with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 4.10 (Proprietary Rights) and 4.25 (Privacy
and Marketing), until the date that is 2 years after the Closing Date and (d)
with respect to all other representations and warranties set forth in Articles
3, 4 and 5, until the date that is 12 months after the Closing Date. The
indemnification obligations under Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 with respect
to breaches of covenants and agreements which by their term contemplate
performance prior to the Closing shall survive the Closing until the date that
is 12 months after the Closing Date. The indemnification obligations under
Section 10.2 and Section 10.3 with respect to breaches of covenants and
agreements which by their terms contemplate performance after the Closing
shall continue until the statute of limitations (giving effect to any waiver,
mitigation or extension thereof) bar any claims regarding a breach thereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if written notice
of any claim for indemnification hereunder has been delivered in accordance
herewith prior to the expiration of the applicable period set forth above, the
indemnification obligations shall continue with respect to such claim until
the final resolution and satisfaction of such claim in accordance with the
provisions of this Article 10, and the Indemnifying Party shall indemnify the
Indemnified Party for all Adverse Consequences incurred in respect of such
claim (subject to any applicable limitations herein), regardless of when such
Adverse Consequences are incurred. The Parties specifically and unambiguously
intend that the survival periods that are set forth in this Section shall
replace any statute of limitations for such representations or warranties that
would otherwise be applicable (including, without limitation, the statute of
limitations prescribed by the law of the State of Delaware). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.2Indemnification by Seller Parties. Seller Parties jointly and
severally agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Buyer Indemnified Parties
from and against, and pay or reimburse the Buyer Indemnified Parties for, any
and all Adverse Consequences which any Buyer Indemnified Party may suffer,
sustain or incur directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or
otherwise by virtue of: (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations or warranties contained in this Agreement; (b) any breach by
any Seller Party of any of its covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; or (c) any Excluded Liability. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.3Indemnification by Buyer. Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Seller Indemnified Parties from and against, and pay or reimburse
the Seller Indemnified Parties for, any and all Adverse Consequences which any
Seller Indemnified Party may suffer, sustain or  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t63  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

incur directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or otherwise by
virtue of: (a) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement; (b) a breach by Buyer of any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; or (c) any Assumed
Liability.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.4Indemnification Procedure. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)In the event that any Person entitled to indemnification under this
Agreement (an "Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or of the commencement of any Proceeding by any Person who is not a
Party or an Affiliate of a Party (a "Third Party Claim") against such
Indemnified Party, with respect to which a Party is or may be required to
provide indemnification under this Agreement (an "Indemnifying Party"), the
Indemnified Party shall give written notice regarding such Third Party Claim
to the Indemnifying Party within 30 days after learning of such Third Party
Claim; provided, however, that the failure to so notify an Indemnifying
Party shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder
except to the extent that the Indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses
or is otherwise materially prejudiced by reason of such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such
Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party's expense. The Indemnifying
Party shall be entitled to assume the defense thereof (subject to the
limitations set forth below) at its expense by appointing a nationally
recognized and reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Party to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense, provided that
the Indemnifying Party first enters into a written agreement that the
Indemnifying Party is unconditionally obligated to pay and satisfy any Adverse
Consequences which may arise with respect to such Third Party Claim that are
subject to indemnity hereunder and provides evidence of its ability to satisfy
such obligation, in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Party. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)If the Indemnifying Party has assumed the defense of a Third Party
Claim in accordance with the terms hereof, the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and to employ counsel of
its choice for such purpose, and the fees and expenses of such separate
counsel shall be borne by the Indemnified Party other than (i) any fees and
expenses of such separate counsel that are incurred prior to the date the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and (ii) any fees and
expenses of such separate counsel if the Indemnified Party reasonably shall
have concluded (upon advice of its counsel) that there may be one or more
legal defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are not available to
the Indemnifying Party or that the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying
Party may have different, conflicting, or adverse legal positions or interests
with respect to such Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control the defense of a Third
Party Claim (and the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to maintain or assume
control of the defense of such Third Party Claim) if (i) the Third Party Claim
relates to or involves any criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation
or investigation; (ii) the Indemnified Party reasonably believes an adverse
determination with respect to the Third Party Claim would be detrimental to or
injure the Indemnified Party's reputation or future business prospects; (iii)
the Third Party Claim seeks an  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t64  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party; or (iv)
the Indemnified Party reasonably believes that the Adverse Consequences
relating to the claim could exceed the maximum amount that such Indemnified
Party would then be entitled to recover under this Article 10.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)If the Indemnifying Party shall control the defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party before entering into any settlement of, consenting to
the entry of any judgment with respect to or ceasing to defend such Third
Party Claim if (i) pursuant to or as a result of such settlement, consent or
cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the
Indemnified Party, or a finding or admission of any violation of Law would be
made by any Indemnified Party, or such settlement, consent or cessation could
otherwise reasonably be expected to interfere with or adversely affect the
business, operations or assets of the Indemnified Party; or (ii) such
settlement or judgment does not expressly and unconditionally release all
Indemnified Parties from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such
Third Party Claim. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Any claim by an Indemnified Party for indemnification not involving
a Third Party Claim may be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party written
notice thereof. If the Indemnifying Party does not notify the Indemnified
Party within 30 days following its receipt of such notice that the
Indemnifying Party disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party, such claim
specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
an obligation of the Indemnifying Party hereunder, and the Indemnifying Party
will pay the amount of such Adverse Consequences to the Indemnified Party on
demand. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.5Certain Limitations. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)Deductible on Adverse Consequences of Buyer Indemnified Parties.
Seller Parties shall not be liable under Section 10.2(a) unless the aggregate
Adverse Consequences incurred by the Buyer Indemnified Parties with respect to
all matters for which indemnification is to be provided under Section 10.2(a)
exceed an amount equal to 0.5% of the Purchase Price actually paid by Buyer to
Seller Parties (including amounts paid into the Escrow Funds) (the
"Deductible"), in which case Seller Parties shall be jointly and severally
liable under Section 10.2(a) for all Adverse Consequences in excess of the
Deductible. In addition, Seller Parties shall not be liable under Section
10.2(a) with respect to any matter or series of related matters unless the
Adverse Consequences with respect to such matter or series of related matters
exceed $25,000 (the "Per Claim Deductible"), and such Adverse Consequences
will not be counted towards the Deductible unless they exceed the Per Claim
Deductible. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)Deductible on Adverse Consequences of Seller Indemnified Parties.
Buyer shall not be liable under Section 10.3(a) unless the aggregate Adverse
Consequences incurred by the Seller Indemnified Parties with respect to all
matters for which indemnification is to be provided under Section 10.3(a)
exceed the Deductible, in which case Buyer shall be liable under Section
10.3(a) for all Adverse Consequences in excess of the Deductible. In addition,
Buyer shall not be liable under Section 10.3(a) with respect to any matter or
series of related matters unless the Adverse Consequences with respect to such
matter or series of related matters exceed  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t65  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

the Per Claim Deductible, and such Adverse Consequences will not be counted
towards the Deductible unless they exceed the Per Claim Deductible.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)Caps on Adverse Consequences of Buyer Indemnified Parties. The
aggregate amount required to be paid by the Seller Parties under Section
10.2(a) (excluding payments with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
of the representations or warranties contained in in Sections 4.10
(Proprietary Rights) and 4.25 (Privacy and Marketing)) shall not exceed an
amount equal to 10% of the Purchase Price actually paid by Buyer to Seller
Parties (including amounts paid into the Escrow Funds) (the "Cap"). The
aggregate amount required to be paid by the Seller Parties under Section
10.2(a) (including payments with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any
of the representations or warranties contained in in Sections 4.10
(Proprietary Rights) and 4.25 (Privacy and Marketing)) shall not exceed an
amount equal to 50% of the Purchase Price actually paid by Buyer to Seller
Parties (including amounts paid into the Escrow Funds) (the "Special Cap").
In no event shall the aggregate amount required to be paid by Seller Parties
under this Agreement exceed an amount equal to the Purchase Price actually
paid by Buyer to Seller Parties (including amounts paid into the Escrow Funds)
(the "Overall Cap"). For the avoidance of doubt, if a Buyer Indemnified Party
would have been indemnified, held harmless or reimbursed for Adverse
Consequences hereunder but for the application of the Cap, Special Cap or
Overall Cap, if the amount of Purchase Price actually paid by Buyer to Seller
Parties (including amounts paid into the Escrow Funds) subsequently increases,
such Buyer Indemnified Party shall be entitled to be indemnified, held
harmless or reimbursed for such Adverse Consequences up to the new amount of
the Cap, Special Cap or Overall Cap, as the case may be. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)Cap on Adverse Consequences of Seller Indemnified Parties. The
aggregate amount required to be paid by Buyer under Section 10.3(a) shall not
exceed the Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Seller Indemnified Party
would have been indemnified, held harmless or reimbursed for Adverse
Consequences hereunder but for the application of the Cap, if the amount of
Purchase Price actually paid by Buyer to Seller Parties (including amounts
paid into the Escrow Funds) subsequently increases, such Seller Indemnified
Party shall be entitled to be indemnified, held harmless or reimbursed for
such Adverse Consequences up to the new amount of the Cap. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)Exceptions to Deductible and Caps. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, (i) the limitations set forth in Sections 10.5(a)
through (d) shall not apply to Adverse Consequences directly or indirectly
arising out of, relating to or otherwise by virtue of any breach of a
Fundamental Representation and (ii) no indemnification payment made by any
Indemnifying Party directly or indirectly arising out of, relating to or
otherwise by virtue of any breach of any Fundamental Representation shall be
considered in determining whether the Deductible or the Cap or Special Cap has
been exceeded. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)Mitigation; Insurance; Third Party Indemnity. Indemnified Parties
shall mitigate Adverse Consequences they suffer, sustain or incur to the
extent required by Delaware Law. The amount of Adverse Consequences for which
indemnification shall be available pursuant to Sections 10.2 and 10.3 shall be
reduced by (i) any insurance proceeds actually received from a third party
insurer by an Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with
 \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t66  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

the matter giving rise to such Adverse Consequences (net of the amount of
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) of recovery or
collection thereof and any applicable deductibles, retentions or similar costs
or payments or increased premiums), and (ii) any indemnity or contribution
amounts actually received from third parties by an Indemnified Party or its
Affiliates in connection with the matter giving rise to such Adverse
Consequences (net of any applicable costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorney's fees) of recovery or collection thereof). Any such net amounts
actually received by an Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof with
respect to any matter after such Indemnified Party has actually received an
indemnity payment hereunder with respect to such matter shall be promptly paid
over to the Indemnifying Party (or, if such amount was paid from the Escrow
Fund and the final date for release of the Escrow Fund has not passed, to the
Escrow Agent for inclusion in the Escrow Fund), provided, that the Indemnified
Party shall not be obligated to pay over any such amount in excess of the
amount of the indemnity payment hereunder to the Indemnified Party with
respect to such matter. Nothing under this Section 10.5(f) shall (i) limit,
delay or otherwise affect the rights of any Indemnified Party to be
indemnified pursuant to Section 10.2 or 10.3 when due (without regard to the
availability or pendency of any insurance or third party indemnity claims) or
(ii) require an Indemnified Party to make any claim or take any other action
with respect to any customer, supplier or other significant business
relationship.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)Damages Limitations. No Party shall have any liability under any
provision of this Agreement for any punitive damages (other than any such
damages paid or payable to a third party) relating to the breach or alleged
breach of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.6Materiality Qualifiers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, for purposes of determining (a) whether a breach of a
representation or warranty exists for purposes of this Agreement, (b) the
amount of Adverse Consequences arising from such a breach for which the Buyer
Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties are entitled to
indemnification under this Agreement and (c) whether the Per Claim Deductible
or the Deductible has been exceeded, each representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement shall be read without giving effect to any
qualification that is based on materiality, including the words "material",
"Material Adverse Effect", "in any material respect" and other uses of the
word "material" or words of similar meaning (and shall be treated as if such
words were deleted from such representation or warranty). \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.7Exclusivity. Following the Closing, except as set forth in
Sections 2.5 and 2.6, the indemnification provided for in this Article 10
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy and recourse for any breach of this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything else to the contrary in
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (a) in the case of fraud
or intentional misrepresentation (but excluding negligent misrepresentation),
the Buyer Indemnified Parties or the Seller Indemnified Parties, as
applicable, shall have all remedies available under this Agreement or
otherwise at Law without giving effect to any of the limitations or waivers
contained herein and (b) nothing herein shall limit any Party's right to seek
and obtain equitable remedies with respect to any covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.8Investigation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
herein, and any Person's right  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t67  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

to indemnification or other remedies with respect thereto, shall not be
affected or deemed waived by reason of (a) any investigation made by or on
behalf of such Person or any of its Affiliates or the directors, officers,
employees, consultants, financial advisors, counsel, accountants and other
agents of such Person or any of its Affiliates or the fact that such Person or
any of its Affiliates or the directors, officers, employees, consultants,
financial advisors, counsel, accountants and other agents of such Person or
any of its Affiliates knew or should have known at any time that any such
representation or warranty is, was or might be inaccurate, or that any such
covenant or agreement was, or may have been breached, in each case, at any
time, whether before or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement or
the Closing, or (b) such Person's waiver of any condition to the Closing or
participation in the Closing.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.9Payment. If any amount owed under this Article 10 is not paid
within 30 days after a final settlement among the Indemnifying Parties and the
Indemnified Parties or a final adjudication determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that an indemnification obligation is owing by the Indemnifying
Party to the Indemnified Party (either, a "Final Determination"), Buyer may,
in its sole discretion, in addition to all other remedies it may have, recover
some or all of such amount by setting off such amount against any amounts then
due and payable by Buyer or any of its Affiliates to any Seller Party or any
of their respective Affiliates, including, without limitation, by setting off
against all or any portion of the Earnout Amount. In each case, the exercise
of such right to cancel or set off shall not constitute a breach of any Buyer
Indemnified Party's obligations under this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t10.10Purchase Price Adjustment. Except as the result of any Wage
Election, any indemnification received under this Article 10 and any payments
under Sections 2.5(a), 2.5(e), 2.6(c) and 7.10 shall be treated by Buyer,
Seller Parties and their respective Affiliates, to the extent permitted by
Law, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for income Tax purposes.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\tARTICLE 11 
MISCELLANEOUS \t\t

 \t\t

p.m. Pacific time, or the next succeeding Business Day if such transmission

 \t\t\t11.2Expenses. Except as otherwise provided herein or therein, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with or related to this Agreement and the
Transaction Documents and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not
such transactions are consummated; provided that, if the Closing occurs, the
Seller Transaction Expenses shall be borne and paid as provided in this
Agreement. In the event of termination of this Agreement, the obligation of
each Party to pay its own expenses will be subject to any rights of such Party
arising from a breach of this Agreement by the other. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.3Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and the Transaction Documents constitute the entire agreement of the Parties
relating to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior and
contemporaneous agreements, negotiations, correspondence, undertakings and
communications of the Parties, oral or written, with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof. Notwithstanding any oral agreement or course of
conduct of the parties or their officers, directors, managers, employees,
attorneys, accountants, consultants, financial advisors and other agents to
the contrary, no Party shall be under any legal  \t\t \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t69  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

obligation to enter into or complete the transactions contemplated hereby
unless and until this Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by each
of the Parties.

 \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.4No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement shall inure
exclusively to the benefit of and be binding upon the Parties, any Person
entitled to indemnification under Article 10 with respect to the provisions
therein, and their respective successors, permitted assigns, executors and
legal representatives. Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is
intended to confer on any Person (other than the Parties or their respective
successors and permitted assigns, any Person entitled to indemnification under
Article 10 with respect to the provisions therein) any rights, remedies,
obligations or liabilities under or by reason of this Agreement. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.5Assignments. This Agreement may not be assigned by either party
hereto without the prior written consent of the other party hereto; provided
that, without such consent, Buyer may (a) transfer or assign, in whole or in
part or from time to time, to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to
purchase all or a portion of the Purchased Assets or assume all or a portion
of the Assumed Liabilities or (b) assign its rights under this Agreement to
its lenders for collateral security purposes, but in each case, no such
transfer or assignment will relieve Buyer of any of its obligations hereunder.
Subject to the foregoing, all of the terms and provisions of this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.6Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement shall not be amended, modified
or waived in any manner except by an agreement in writing duly executed and
delivered by each of Buyer and Seller. No failure or delay of any Party to
exercise any right or remedy given to such Party under this Agreement or
otherwise available to such Party or to insist upon strict compliance by any
other Party with its or his obligations hereunder, no single or partial
exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of
steps to enforce such right or power, and no custom or practice of the Parties
in variance with the terms hereof, shall constitute a waiver of any Party's
right to demand exact compliance with the terms hereof. Any written waiver
shall be limited to those items specifically waived therein and shall not be
deemed to waive any future breaches or violations or other non-specified
breaches or violations unless, and to the extent, expressly set forth
therein. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.7Agreement Controls. In the event that a provision of any
Transaction Document is inconsistent with, conflicts with or contradicts any
term of this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall prevail.  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.8Severability. Without limiting Section 7.1(f), (a) if any term or
provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect under any applicable Law, the validity, legality and enforceability of
all other terms and provisions of this Agreement will not in any way be
affected or impaired, and (b) if the final judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction or other Governmental Authority declares that any term or
provision hereof is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties agree that
the court making such determination will have the power to reduce the scope,
duration, area or applicability of the term or provision, to delete specific
words or phrases, or to replace any invalid, illegal or unenforceable term or

 \t\t

provision with a term or provision that is valid, legal and enforceable and
that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable term or provision. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.9Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with, and all questions concerning the construction, validity,
interpretation, inducement to enter and/or performance of this Agreement
(whether related to breach of contract, tortious conduct or otherwise and
whether now existing or hereafter arising) shall be governed by, the internal
Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any law or rule that
would cause the Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware to
be applied. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.10Consent to Jurisdiction; Service of Process; Waiver of Jury
Trial. Each Party agrees that any Proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement or any transaction contemplated hereby shall be brought
exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery in New Castle County, or in the
event (but only in the event) that such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction over such action, the United States District Court for the
District of Delaware, and each of the Parties hereby submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of such courts for itself and with respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, for the purpose of any such Proceeding. A final
judgment in any such Proceeding may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party agrees not
to commence any Proceeding arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated except in the courts described above (other than actions in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce any judgment, decree or award
rendered by any such court in Delaware as described above), irrevocably and
unconditionally waives any objection to the laying of venue of any Proceeding
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby in any
such court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not
to plead or claim in any such court that any such Proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum or does not have
jurisdiction over any Party. Each Party further agrees that service of any
process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to such Party's
respective address set forth herein shall be effective service of process for
any such Proceeding. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT,
TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF SUCH PARTY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF. EACH PARTY
FURTHER WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE ANY PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER PROCEEDING IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT
OR HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED OR
WARRANTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 11.10. \t\t

 \t\t\t11.11Admissibility into Evidence. All offers of compromise or
settlement among the Parties or their officers, directors, managers,
employees, attorneys, accountants, consultants, financial advisors or other
agents in connection with the attempted resolution of any dispute under this
Agreement shall be deemed to have been delivered in furtherance of a
settlement and shall be exempt from discovery and production and shall not be
admissible in evidence (whether as an admission or otherwise) in any
Proceeding for the resolution of such dispute. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.12Other Remedies. Except to the extent set forth otherwise in this
Agreement, all remedies under this Agreement expressly conferred upon a Party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such Party, and the exercise by a Party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.13Rules of Construction. The following rules of construction shall
govern the interpretation of this Agreement:  \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(a)all references to Articles, Sections or Schedules are to Articles,
Sections or Schedules in this Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(b)each accounting term not otherwise defined in this Agreement has
the meaning assigned to it in accordance with GAAP; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(c)unless the context otherwise requires, words in the singular or
plural include the singular and plural, and pronouns stated in either the
masculine, the feminine or neuter gender shall include the masculine, feminine
and neuter; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(d)whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "but not
limited to"; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(e)the word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
simply mean "if"; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(f)references to any statute, rule, regulation or form (including in
the definition thereof) shall be deemed to include references to such statute,
rule, regulation or form as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced from
time to time (and, in the case of any statute, include any rules and
regulations promulgated under such statute), and all references to any section
of any statute, rule, regulation or form include any successor to such
section; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(g)when calculating the period of time before which, within which or
following which any act is to be done or step taken pursuant to this
Agreement, the date that is referenced in beginning the calculation of such
period will be excluded (for example, if an action is to be taken within 2
days after a triggering event and such event occurs on a Tuesday, then the
action must be taken by Thursday); if the last day of such period is a non-
Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding Business
Day; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(h)Time is of the essence with regard to all dates and time periods
set forth or referred to in this Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t   \t\t

  \t\t

  \t\t\t72  \t\t   \t\t\t   \t\t

  

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(i)the subject headings of Articles and Sections of this Agreement are
included for purposes of convenience of reference only and shall not affect
the construction or interpretation of any of its provisions; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(j)(1) the terms "hereof", "herein", "hereby", "hereto", and
derivative or similar words refer to this entire Agreement, including the
Schedules and Exhibits hereto; (2) the term "any" means "any and all"; and (3)
the term "or" shall not be exclusive and shall mean "and/or"; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(k)(1) references to "days" means calendar days unless Business Days
are expressly specified; and (2) references to "$" mean U.S. dollars; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(l)the Parties intend that each representation, warranty, covenant and
agreement contained herein shall have independent significance, and if any
Party has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained herein in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same or
similar subject matter that the Party has not breached shall not detract from
or mitigate the fact that the Party is in breach of the first representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(m)all uses of "written" contained in Articles 3, 4 and 5 shall be
deemed to include written information transmitted via e-mail or
facsimile; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(n)for purposes of Article 4, information shall be deemed to have been
"made available" to Buyer only if such information was posted to (and not
removed from) the electronic data room maintained by Vista Point Partners in a
manner accessible and reviewable by Buyer at least 1 day prior to the date of
this Agreement; \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(o)any drafts of this Agreement or any Transaction Document circulated
by or among the Parties prior to the final fully executed drafts shall not be
used for purposes of interpreting any provision of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document, and each of the Parties agrees that no Party,
Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party shall make any claim, assert any
defense or otherwise take any position inconsistent with the foregoing in
connection with any dispute or Proceeding among any of the foregoing or for
any other purpose; and \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t(p)the Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement and the Transaction Documents; in the event an
ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement and
the Transaction Documents shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement or any Transaction Document and the language used in it will be
deemed to be the language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual
intent. \t\t

 \t\t

 \t\t\t11.14Counterparts; Deliveries. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. This
Agreement, the Transaction Documents and each other agreement or instrument
entered into in connection herewith or therewith or contemplated hereby or
thereby, and any amendments hereto or thereto, to the extent signed and
delivered by means of electronic transmission of .pdf files or other image
files via e-mail, cloud-based transfer or file  \t\t \t\t

 \t\t

transfer protocol, or use of a facsimile machine, shall be treated in all
manner and respects and for all purposes as an original agreement or
instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. No party to
any such agreement or instrument shall raise the use of electronic
transmission or a facsimile machine to deliver a signature or the fact that
any signature or agreement or instrument was transmitted or communicated
through the use of electronic transmission or a facsimile machine as a defense
to the formation or enforceability of a contract, and each such party forever
waives any such defense.
