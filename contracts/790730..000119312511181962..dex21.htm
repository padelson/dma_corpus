2 ARTICLE II

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

SECTION 2.01  _Conversion of Securities_. At the Effective Time, the
following shall occur by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any of the following
securities:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
(all issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock being hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " _Shares_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (including Company Restricted Shares
but excluding (x) any Shares to be canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b), (y)
Shares owned by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company
and not owned on behalf of a third person and (z) any Dissenting Shares) shall
be canceled and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive an
amount per Share (subject to any applicable withholding Tax specified in
Section 2.02(f)) equal to $85.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, each holder of any such Shares
(other than holders of Dissenting Shares), including any Company Restricted
Shares, whether or not restrictions have lapsed, shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration and any declared but unpaid dividends upon surrender of such
Shares in accordance with Section 2.02, without interest.

(b)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each Share held
in the treasury of the Company and each Share owned by Merger Sub, Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent immediately prior to
the Effective Time and not held or owned on behalf of a third person shall be
canceled automatically without any conversion thereof and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $2.50 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute the only shares of capital
stock of the Surviving Corporation.

SECTION 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_. 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a
bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance
reasonably acceptable to the Company, with such Paying Agent for the deposit
and payment of the (A) aggregate Merger Consideration, (B) aggregate amount
of cash dividends, if any, that (1) (x) were declared prior to the date hereof
related to the Company Restricted Shares, (y) were declared prior to the date
hereof, as described on _Section 3.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
or (z) were declared after the date hereof and are expressly permitted
hereunder to have been so declared, (2) have a record date prior to the
Effective Time and (3) are unpaid at the Effective Time (the " _Outstanding
Dividends_ ") and (C) Option Payments in accordance with this Article II.
Parent shall provide the Paying Agent with irrevocable instructions and
authority to pay each respective holder of record (or otherwise pursuant to
Section 2.02(b) below) of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares (other than any
(x)

 



3  Shares canceled pursuant to Section 2.01(b), (y) Shares owned by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company and not owned on behalf of
a third person and (z) any Dissenting Shares), as evidenced by a list of such
holders certified by an officer of the Surviving Corporation or the Surviving
Corporations transfer agent, the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares and the amount of Outstanding Dividends due
thereon. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or cause to
be deposited, with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares
and Company Stock Options and separate and apart from its other funds, as a
trust fund, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration and Outstanding Dividends required to be paid pursuant to
Section 2.01(a) and the aggregate Option Payments required to be paid pursuant
to Section 2.04(b) (such cash to pay the Merger Consideration, Outstanding
Dividends and the Option Payments being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
Parent; provided, however, that such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality
thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of
America and may be liquidated at any time without loss or penalty. If for any
reason (including investment losses) the cash in the Exchange Fund is
insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in
cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, Parent shall promptly deposit cash into
the Exchange Fund in an amount that is equal to the deficiency in the amount
of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. Any net
profit resulting from, or interest or income produced by, such investments
shall be payable to Parent. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all charges
and expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, incurred by it in
connection with the exchange of Shares for the Merger Consideration and other
amounts contemplated by this Section 2.02(a).

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who was, at
the Effective Time, a holder of record of Shares entitled to receive the
Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends pursuant to Section 2.01(a):
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
certificates evidencing such Shares (the " _Certificates_ ") shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent (or effective
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof)) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of the Certificates (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof) in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration and Outstanding
Dividends. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate (or effective
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) for cancellation, together with such
letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with
the instructions thereto, the holder of the Shares represented by such
Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration and Outstanding
Dividends pursuant to Section 2.01(a) in respect of the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate (or effective affidavit of loss in lieu
thereof), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. As
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Paying Agent to issue and deliver to each holder of uncertificated Shares
represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") the amount of cash that
such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 2.02(a) in respect of
such Book-Entry Shares, without such holder being required to deliver a
Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent, and
such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. If payment of the Merger
Consideration and Outstanding Dividends pursuant to Section 2.01(a) is to be
made

 



4  to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
or Book-Entry Share is registered in the transfer records of the Company, it
shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer or such
Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that the Person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer or other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share surrendered or shall establish to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent
that such Tax is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 2.02, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at all
times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon
such surrender the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends to which
the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share is entitled pursuant to
this Article II. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable
to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of
this Article II. The method of payment of cash for Shares converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends shall be
by wire transfer, bank check or other method that will provide a holder of
Shares not later than second day funds. Parent shall instruct the Paying Agent
to timely pay the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends. Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
procedures with the Paying Agent and the Depository Trust Company (" _DTC_ ")
to ensure that (i) if the Closing occurs at or prior to 11:30 a.m. (New York
time) on the date of the Closing, the Paying Agent will transmit to DTC or
its nominees on the date of the Closing an amount in cash in immediately
available funds equal to the sum of (x) the number of Shares held of record by
DTC or such nominee immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Merger Consideration and (y) the Outstanding Dividends with respect to such
Shares (such amount, the " _DTC Payment_ "), and (ii) if the Closing occurs
after 11:30 a.m. (New York time) on the date of the Closing, the Paying Agent
will transmit to DTC or its nominee on the first business day after the date
of the Closing an amount in cash in immediately available funds equal to the
DTC Payment.

 

(c) _No Further Rights_. From and after the Effective Time, holders of
Certificates and holders of Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any rights
as stockholders of the Company, except as provided herein or by Law.

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. At any time that is more than one (1)
year after the Effective Time, Parent shall be entitled to require the Paying
Agent to deliver to it any Exchange Funds which had been deposited with the
Paying Agent and have not been disbursed in accordance with this Article II
(including interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect
of the funds made available to it), and after the Exchange Funds have been
delivered to Parent, Persons entitled to payment in accordance with this
Article II shall be entitled to look to Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(subject to abandoned property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of
the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends upon surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares held by them, without any interest thereon;
provided, that such Person shall have no greater rights against Parent than
may be accorded to general creditors of Parent under applicable Laws. Any
portion of the Exchange Funds deposited with the Paying Agent remaining
unclaimed as of a date that is immediately prior to such time as such amounts
would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 



5 (e) _No Liability_. None of the Paying Agent, Merger Sub, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of Shares for any such
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash delivered
to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.

 

(f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation
and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares
(including Company Restricted Shares) and Company Stock Options, without
duplications, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to such payment under all applicable Tax Laws. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by
the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be,
such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Paying Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Parent,
as the case may be.

 

(g) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable and customary
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay
in respect of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger
Consideration and Outstanding Dividends to which the holder thereof is
entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a).

SECTION 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
If, at or after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the
Paying Agent or Parent for any reason or transfer is sought for Book-Entry
Shares, such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be canceled against
delivery of the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.01(a), subject to
applicable Law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

SECTION 2.04 _Company Stock Options_.

 

(a) As part of the Transactions (as defined in Section 3.04), the Company
shall ensure that (i) immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding option to purchase Company Common Stock granted under any Company
Stock Plan shall become immediately vested and exercisable in full and each
holder of such option shall have at least ten (10) days prior to
the Effective Time during which to exercise such option (which exercise may
be contingent upon the occurrence of the Effective Time), (ii) at the
Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock granted
under the Company Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") shall be
canceled as of the Effective Time in exchange for the consideration
contemplated by Section 2.04(b) to be paid by the Surviving Corporation to
each former holder of any such canceled Company Stock Option as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and (iii) at the Effective Time, all of
the Company Stock Plans shall be terminated, in each case, in accordance with
and pursuant to the terms of the Company Stock Plans.

 



6 (b) Each holder of a Company Stock Option that is outstanding and unexercised
as of the Effective Time, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time,
and has an exercise price per share of Company Common Stock that is less than
the per share Merger Consideration shall be entitled to receive and shall
(subject to the provisions of this Section 2.04) be paid out of the Exchange
Fund as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, in exchange for the
cancellation of such Company Stock Option, an amount in cash (subject to any
applicable withholding Taxes) equal to (i) the difference between the per
share Merger Consideration and the applicable exercise price per share of such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the aggregate number of Shares
issuable upon exercise, whether or not exercisable at the Effective Time, of
such Company Stock Option (the " _Option Payment_ "). Any such payments shall
be subject to all applicable federal, state and local Tax withholding
requirements, and shall be made by wire transfer, bank check or other method
that will provide a holder of Shares not later than second day funds. Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to timely pay the Option Payments. If,
however, the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of a Company
Stock Option is equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration,
such Company Stock Option shall be canceled without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof.

SECTION 2.05 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary and to
the extent available under the DGCL, Shares that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by any stockholder
that is entitled to demand and properly demands the appraisal for such Shares
(the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to, and that complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not
be converted into, or represent the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration. Any such stockholder shall instead be entitled to receive
payment of the fair value of such stockholders Dissenting Shares in
accordance with the provisions of Section 262; provided, however, that
all Dissenting Shares held by any stockholder that shall have failed to
perfect or that otherwise shall have withdrawn or lost such stockholders
rights to appraisal of such Shares under Section 262 or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such stockholder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262, then such stockholder or stockholders (as the
case may be) shall forfeit such rights as are granted by Section 262 and each
such Dissenting Share shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into,
and to have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and Outstanding Dividends, without any
interest thereon, upon surrender of such stockholders Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in the manner provided in Section 2.02. At the Effective Time,
any holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect
thereto, except the rights provided in Section 262 and as provided in the
preceding sentence.

(b) The Company shall give Parent (i) notice as promptly as practicable of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Shares and
withdrawals of such demands and (ii) the right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal under the
DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent,
make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands, except to the extent
it is expressly required to do so by court order.

 



7 SECTION 2.06 _Adjustment of Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if, between the date of this Agreement and
the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding Shares shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any stock
split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, redenomination,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration and any other similarly dependent items
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the
Merger Consideration or other dependent item, subject to further adjustment
in accordance with this sentence.

Letter.

SECTION 3.06 _Company Permits; Compliance_.

(a) Each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in possession of all

consents, certificates, approvals and orders of any Governmental Authority
necessary for each such entity to own, lease and operate its properties or to
carry on its business as it is now being conducted (the " _Permits_ "),

 



11  except where the failure to have any of the Permits would not reasonably be
expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation
of any of the Permits is pending or, to the knowledge of the Company,
threatened, except where the suspension or cancellation of any of the Permits
would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries is, and has been, in compliance
with, and has taken any necessary steps to become in compliance with: (i) any
Material Contract or Permit to which such entity is a party or by which such
entity or any property or asset of such entity is bound; and (ii) any Law

bound or affected; and all notices, reports, documents and other information
required to be filed under any Material Contract, Permit or Law were properly

except where such failure to file or to be in compliance would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no representation or
warranty is made in this Section 3.06(a) with respect to (a) the Securities

The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act); such
disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide that information
relating to the Company, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to
be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer to allow timely
decisions regarding required disclosure; and such disclosure controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms. The Companys principal executive
officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed, based on their
most recent evaluation, to the Companys auditors and the audit committee of
the Company Board (i) all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in
the design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting that are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for the
Companys auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the Companys internal controls. The Company
has established and maintains internal control over financial reporting (as
defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act. Management of the Company has completed its
assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control of financial
reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act for the year ended November 30, 2010, and such assessment concluded
that such controls were effective. Since November 30, 2010, any material
change in internal control over financial reporting required to be disclosed
in any SEC Reports has been so disclosed.

Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the knowledge of the Company, any
director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries has received or otherwise obtained
knowledge of any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective internal accounting controls relating to periods after November 30,

consolidated results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the
respective periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited

of business since February 27, 2011, (iii) for liabilities and obligations
incurred pursuant to the Transactions, (iv) for liabilities or obligations
which have been discharged or paid in full in the ordinary course of business
in a manner consistent with past practice prior to the date of this Agreement

the Companys knowledge, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature, whether or not accrued,
contingent or otherwise, either matured or unmatured.

 

(d) Except as set forth on _Section 3.07(d)_ of the Company Disclosure

all amendments and supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "), to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger, will, when filed, comply as
to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act.

(b) None of the information included or incorporated by reference in the
Proxy Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys
stockholders or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting or at the
time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Disclosure Documents
based upon information furnished to the Company in writing by Merger Sub or

(d) Since November 30, 2010, the Company and its Subsidiaries have not

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

SECTION 6.01 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC the preliminary Proxy Statement; provided that Parent shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement (and any
amendments thereto) before it is filed. Each of the Company and Parent shall
furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates that is required
to be included in the Proxy Statement or that is customarily included in proxy
statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated
by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the definitive Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement. The Company and
Parent shall promptly notify each other upon the receipt of any comments from
the SEC or its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments
or supplements

 



31  to the Proxy Statement and shall provide each other with copies of all
correspondence between it and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
SEC and its staff, on the other hand, relating to the Proxy Statement. If at
any time prior to the Company Stockholders Meeting, any information relating
to the Company, Parent or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors should be discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy
Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they are made, not misleading, the party which discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties, and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed with the SEC and, to
the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the
Company.

SECTION 6.02 _Company Stockholders  Meeting_. As promptly as practicable
after the SEC indicates that it has no further comments on the Proxy
Statement, the Company, acting through the Company Board, and in accordance
with applicable Law, shall duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders  Meeting_") for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. Unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the Company shall
hold the Company Stockholders Meeting regardless of whether the Company Board
has effected a Change of Recommendation. The Company Board shall (a)
recommend to holders of the Shares that they adopt this Agreement, (b) include
such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and (c) use its reasonable best
efforts to solicit and obtain the Stockholder Approval (including,
if requested by Parent, engaging a proxy solicitation firm), except to the
extent the Company Board determines in its reasonable judgment that the making
of, or failure to withdraw, qualify or modify, such recommendation would
violate the fiduciary duties of the Company Board under applicable Law.

SECTION 6.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law, from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall (and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to): (i) provide to Parent and to the officers, directors,
employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financing sources, agents
and other representatives (collectively, " _Representatives_ ") of Parent
reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon reasonable prior
notice by Parent, to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the books and
records thereof, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to furnish
promptly to Parent such information concerning the business, properties,
Contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as Parent or its Representatives may reasonably request;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to permit Parent or
its Representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling of
properties, offices or other facilities of the Company or its Subsidiaries.
Parent will use reasonable efforts to minimize any disruption to the business
of the Company and its Subsidiaries which may result from the requests for
access, data and information hereunder.

 

(b) All information obtained by Parent or its Representatives pursuant to this
Section 6.03 shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
confidentiality agreement, dated November 19, 2010, (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company.

 



32 SECTION 6.04 _Solicitation of Transactions_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation_. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall, and that it shall direct its and their respective
Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of furnishing information)
any inquiries, proposals or offers that constitute, or could reasonably be
expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any negotiations
or discussions concerning, or provide any non-public information of the
Company or its Subsidiaries to any Person relating to, or take any other
action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition
Proposal (other than informing persons of the existence of the provisions
contained in this Section 6.04), or (iii) enter into any agreement,
arrangement or understanding contemplating or relating to any Acquisition
Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
however, it is understood and agreed that any determination or action by the
Company Board permitted under Section 6.04(b), (g) or (h) or Section 8.01(h)
shall not be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.04(a).

(b) _Permitted Conduct_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 6.04, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, nothing
contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company, or the Company Board,
from (i) furnishing non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, any Person in connection with a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal by such Person, if (A) such Acquisition Proposal was made
after the date of this Agreement and shall remain available (in original or
modified form), (B) such Acquisition Proposal was not solicited, initiated,
knowingly encouraged or facilitated after the date of this Agreement in breach
of, and did not otherwise result from a breach of, Section 6.04(a), (C) the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (D) prior to furnishing
such non-public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations
with, such Person, the Company receives from such Person an executed
confidentiality agreement with terms no less favorable in all material
respects to the Company than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement
(except for such changes specifically necessary in order for the Company to
be able to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) (an " _Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (E) prior to furnishing such non-public
information or providing access to its properties, books or records, the
Company has complied with the provisions of Section 6.04(d); or (ii) complying
with Rule 14e-2 or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard
to an Acquisition Proposal (or any similar communication to stockholders in
connection with the making or amendment of a tender offer or exchange offer)
(a " _Tender Offer Communication_ "); provided that, with respect to this
clause (ii), any Change of Recommendation is made in compliance with Section
6.04(g).

(c) _Parent s Right to Negotiate Following a Superior Proposal_. The Company
agrees that, in the event that it receives a Superior Proposal, for the five
(5) business day period commencing on the date on which it delivers notice of
such Superior Proposal to Parent in accordance with the last sentence of
Section 6.04(d), it shall, if requested by Parent, negotiate in good faith
with, and cause its financial and legal advisors to negotiate in good faith
with, Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement so that the offer
previously constituting a Superior Proposal would no longer constitute a
Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any material

 



33  amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of any such
Superior Proposal shall require a new notice to Parent regarding such Superior
Proposal and a new five (5) business day period and related negotiation
obligation).

(d) _Notification of Acquisition Proposals_. The Company shall notify Parent
promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) in writing after
receipt by the Company (or its Representatives) of any Acquisition Proposal,
any inquiries or contacts that are reasonably likely to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal or any request for non-public information or access to
the properties, books or records of the Company relating to or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Such notice shall
be made in writing and shall indicate in reasonable detail the identity of
the offeror and the terms and conditions of such proposal, inquiry or contact.
The Company shall (i) continue to keep Parent informed, on a prompt basis (and
in any event within two (2) business days), of the status of any material
developments (including any changes or adjustments made to or proposed to be
made to the terms of any such Acquisition Proposal), (ii) provide to Parent
promptly (and in any event within two (2) business days) after receipt or
delivery thereof copies of the Acquisition Proposal, letters and other written
communications received by the Company from such offeror (including any
amendments or supplements); provided that the Company shall not be required
to disclose its internal analyses relating to any such Acquisition Proposal,
and (iii) provide to Parent a list of, and copies of, the due diligence
information provided to the Person making such inquiry, contact, proposal,
offer or request concurrently with delivery to such Person and immediately
provide Parent with access to all due diligence information to which the
Person making such inquiry, contact, proposal, offer or request was provided
access (except for any such information previously provided to Parent), in
the case of clause (iii), subject to the right of the Company to withhold such
portions of information relating to pricing or other matters that are highly
sensitive if the exchange of such information, as reasonably determined by
the Companys outside legal counsel, would be reasonably likely to result in
antitrust difficulties for the Company or in connection with the Merger,
provided that in accordance with the Clean Team Confidentiality Agreement,
dated as of June 29, 2011 (the " _Clean Team Agreement_ "), by and between
Parent and the Company, the Permitted Representatives (as defined in the Clean
Team Agreement) shall be provided access to such sensitive information. The
Company shall promptly provide to Parent reasonable advance written notice of
any scheduled meeting of the Company Board to consider whether an Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

 

(e) The Company shall immediately cease and cause to be terminated all
existing activities, discussions or negotiations by it, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives with any Person other than Parent conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees,
if it has not already done so, to promptly request each Person, if any,
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement within twelve (12)
months prior to the date hereof in connection with any Acquisition Proposal to
return or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such
Person by or on behalf of it or its Subsidiaries. The Company shall not
modify, amend or terminate, or waive, assign or release any material rights or
claims, or grant any consent under, any confidentiality agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal or otherwise under any standstill or similar
agreement or fail to fully enforce any such agreement upon the request of
Parent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may grant a consent or
waiver under, or otherwise fail to enforce, any such agreement in order to
permit a Person to make an unsolicited (after the date of this Agreement)
Acquisition

 



34  Proposal to the Company, provided that the Company has otherwise complied
with this Section 6.04, that upon any grant of waiver or consent, Parent is
promptly notified of such waiver or consent and that the Company shall have
similarly waived or modified any similar provision in the Confidentiality
Agreement as it relates to Parent.

(f) The Company shall take such action as is necessary to inform promptly its
Representatives of the provisions of this Section 6.04. The Company agrees
that any violation of this Section 6.04 by any of the Companys Subsidiaries
or any of its Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section
6.04 by the Company.

(g) _Change of Recommendation_. Neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) fail to make, withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, or publicly propose to withdraw or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve any letter of intent,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or similar agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve, endorse or recommend, or publicly
propose to approve, endorse or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (each of
(i) and (iii), " _Specified Conduct_ "). Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.04(a) and the foregoing provisions of this Section 6.04(g), if, (x)
prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (A) the Company Board
shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel,
that compliance with the preceding sentence would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law (a " _Fiduciary Determination_ "), (B)
the Company Board has notified Parent in writing of the determination
described in clause (A), which notice shall specify in reasonable detail the
material events giving rise thereto (a " _Determination Notice_ "), and (C) at
least five (5) business days following receipt by Parent of the Determination
Notice, and taking into account any revised proposal made by Parent since
receipt of the Determination Notice, the Company Board maintains its Fiduciary
Determination, provided, that, during such period after receipt by Parent of
such notice, the Company has, if requested by Parent, negotiated in good
faith with, and caused the Companys financial and legal advisors to negotiate
in good faith with, Parent to attempt to make such adjustments in the terms
and conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with
the Transactions, or (y) at any time the Company Board shall have made a
Fiduciary Determination in connection with a Tender Offer Communication, then
the Company Board may (1) engage in any of the Specified Conduct (a " _Change
of Recommendation_ "), it being understood that, for the avoidance of doubt,
neither the approval or delivery of a Determination Notice shall be deemed a
Change of Recommendation, and/or (2) upon termination of this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.01(h) and concurrent payment of the Termination Fee
in accordance with Section 8.03 (it being understood and agreed that such
termination shall not be effective until payment of such Termination
Fee), approve and enter into an agreement relating to a Superior Proposal.
Nothing in this Section 6.04 shall permit the Company to terminate this
Agreement except as specifically provided in Article VIII or affect any other
obligation of the Company under this Agreement.

(h) Nothing contained in this Section 6.04 or otherwise in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from making any disclosure to its stockholders if,
in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside legal counsel, failure so to disclose would result in a breach of
applicable Law (including Delaware Law and the federal securities Laws).

 



35 SECTION 6.05 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall
contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification than are
set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company and set forth in
any indemnification agreement currently in effect between the Company and any
officer, director, employee or former officer, former director or former
employee, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner
that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or
prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or
fiduciaries of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; and provided, that, in
the event that any claim for indemnification is asserted or made within such
six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification in respect of such claim
shall continue until the final disposition of such claim.

(b) After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, to
the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless
each present and former director and officer of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against all costs
and expenses (including attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after
the Effective Time), whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of, or pertaining to any action or omission in his or her capacity
as an officer, director, employee, fiduciary or agent, occurring on or before
the Effective Time, to the same extent as provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Company or any other applicable contract or agreement in
effect on the date hereof. In the event of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, (i) the Surviving Corporation shall pay the
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties,
which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation, promptly after statements therefor are received (provided the
applicable Indemnified Party provides an undertaking to repay all advanced
expenses if it is finally judicially determined that such Indemnified Party is
not entitled to indemnification) and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, that the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
the Surviving Corporations written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed); and provided, further, that the Surviving
Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this Section 6.05(b) to pay the
fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of the
applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single action.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall either (i) cause to be obtained at the
Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six
(6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers
liability insurance in amount and scope at least as favorable as the Companys
existing policies for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
prior to the Effective Time from an insurer with an insurer financial
strength rating by A.M. Best Co. of at least "A" or (ii) maintain in effect
for six (6) years from the Effective Time, if available, the current
directors and officers liability insurance policies maintained by the
Company (provided that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions that
are not less favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time; for the avoidance of doubt, the Company may

 



36  purchase such "tail" policies at its option prior to the Effective Time,
and, in such case Parent shall cause such policies to remain in full force and
effect for their full term, and cause all obligations thereunder to be
honored by the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Surviving Corporation be required (or the Company be permitted) to
expend pursuant to this Section 6.05(c) more than an amount per year equal to
250% of the current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance
(whether such insurance was obtained by the Surviving Corporation or by the
Company prior to the Effective Time); provided, further, that, if
the aggregate annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount,
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the
greatest coverage available, with respect to matters occurring prior to the
Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such amount.

(d) This Section 6.05 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, present or
former directors and officers of the Company or its Subsidiaries and their
respective heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent
and the Surviving Corporation and their respective successors and assigns. In
the event that Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any person (including by dissolution), then,
and in each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation assume and
honor the obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. The agreements and
covenants contained in this Section 6.05 shall not be deemed to be exclusive
of any other rights to which any such present or former director or officer
or other Indemnified Party is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract,
Organizational Document or otherwise. Nothing in this Agreement is intended
to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to
directors and officers insurance claims under any policy that is or has been
in existence with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their
respective officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed
that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.05 is not prior to or
in substitution for any such claims under any such policy.

 

(e) From and after the Closing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation
to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this
Section 6.05.

SECTION 6.06 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt written notice
to the Company, of (a) any written notice or other written communication the
subject matter of which is or reasonably could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent or the consummation of the Transactions in
accordance with this Agreement, and that is (i) from any Person (and the
written response thereto of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent, as the
case may be, or its or their Representatives) alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, (ii) from any Governmental Authority (and the written response
thereto of the Company or its Subsidiaries or Parent, as the case may be, or
its or their Representatives) in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions and (iii) except in the event the Company Board shall have
effected a Change of Recommendation, from or to the SEC, (b) the existence of
any event or circumstance that would be likely to cause any condition to the
obligations of any party hereto to effect the Merger and the other
Transactions not to be satisfied

 



37  and (c) the failure of the Company, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case may
be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be
complied with or satisfied by it pursuant to this Agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
party to effect the Merger and the other Transactions not to be satisfied;
provided, however, that failure to give prompt notice pursuant to this
Section 6.06 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether the conditions referred to in Section 7.01, Section 7.02 and Section
7.03 shall have been satisfied, except to the extent that the underlying fact
or circumstance not so notified would, together with such failure to give
prompt notice, constitute a failure to satisfy the conditions referred to in
Section 7.01, Section 7.02 and Section 7.03.

 

SECTION 6.07 _Efforts; Further Actions_.

(a) Except with respect to matters arising under Antitrust Laws, upon the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be
taken, all appropriate action and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law or otherwise to consummate
and make effective the Transactions and (ii) obtain from Governmental
Authorities and third parties any consents, licenses, permits, waivers,
approvals, authorizations or orders set forth on _Section 3.05(a)(iii)_ of
the Company Disclosure Letter.

 

(b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the parties hereto agrees to use its best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, and cooperate with each
other in order to do, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
Antitrust Law to consummate the Transactions at the earliest practicable date,
including: (i) causing the preparation and filing of all forms, registrations
and notices required to be filed to consummate the Merger and the taking of
such actions as are necessary to obtain any requisite consent or expiration of
any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws;
(ii) using best efforts to defend all lawsuits and other proceedings by or
before any Governmental Authority or by any private party challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger; and (iii) using best efforts to
resolve any objection asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
Antitrust Law and to prevent the entry of any court order, and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any injunction, decree, ruling, order
or other action under any Antitrust Laws that would prevent, prohibit,
restrict or delay the consummation of the Transactions.

(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of Section 6.07(b),
each of the parties, as applicable, agrees to prepare and file as promptly as
practicable, and in any event by no later than ten (10) business days from
the date of this Agreement an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report
Form pursuant to the HSR Act and, as soon as practicable, prepare and make any
other filings required pursuant to Foreign Antitrust Laws. Parent shall pay
all filing fees for the filings required under the HSR Act or the Foreign
Antitrust Laws by the Company and Parent.

(d) If a party receives a request for information or documentary material from
any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement or any of the
Transactions, including a Request for Documentary and other Additional
Information under the HSR Act (the " _Second Request_ "), then such party
shall in good faith make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably
practicable and after consultation with the other party, a response that
is in substantial compliance with such Second Request pursuant to 16 C.F.R.
803.6(b).

 



38 (e) The parties shall keep each other apprised of the status of matters
relating to the completion of the Transactions and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining the approvals of or clearances from each applicable
Governmental Authority, including:

(i) cooperating with each other in connection with filings required to be made
by any party under any Antitrust Law and liaising with each other in relation
to each step of the procedure before the relevant Governmental Authorities
and as to the contents of all communications with such Governmental
Authorities. In particular, to the extent permitted by Law or Governmental
Authority, no party will make any notification in relation to
the Transactions without first providing the other party with a copy of such
notification in draft form and giving such other party a reasonable
opportunity to discuss its content before it is filed with the relevant
Governmental Authorities, and such first party shall consider and take
account of all reasonable comments timely made by the other party in this
respect;

(ii) furnishing to each other all information within its possession that is
required for any application or other filing to be made by the other party
pursuant to applicable Law in connection with the Transactions;

 

(iii) promptly notifying each other of any communications from or with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions and ensuring to the
extent permitted by Law or Governmental Authority that each of the parties is
entitled to attend any meetings with or other appearances before any
Governmental Authority with respect to the Transactions;

 

(iv) consulting and cooperating with each other in connection with all
analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions
and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with proceedings under or relating to Antitrust Laws; and

(v) without prejudice to any rights of the parties hereunder, consulting and
cooperating in all respects with each other in defending all lawsuits and
other proceedings by or before any Governmental Authority challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Transactions.

(f) In addition, subject to Section 6.07(g), Parent shall take, or cause to
be taken, all other action and do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable under all Antitrust Laws to consummate the
Transactions, including using its best efforts to obtain the expiration of
all waiting periods and obtain all other approvals and any other consents
required to be obtained in order for the parties to consummate the
Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, subject to Section 6.07(g), Parent shall commit to: (i) selling,
divesting, or otherwise conveying particular assets (including inventory
required during post-sale or divestiture transition periods), categories,
portions or parts of assets or businesses of Parent and its Subsidiaries;
(ii) agreeing to sell, divest, or otherwise convey any particular asset,
category, portion or part of an asset or business of the Company and 

 



39  its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or subsequent to the Effective Time;
(iii) licensing, holding separate or entering into similar arrangements with
respect to the assets or business of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the assets
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and (iv) terminating any and
all existing relationships and contractual rights and obligations relating to
any of the assets, categories, portions or parts of an asset or business
referred to in clauses (i)-(iii) to the extent divested, licensed or held
separate, as a condition to obtaining any and all expirations of waiting
periods under the HSR Act or Foreign Antitrust Laws or consents from any
Governmental Authority necessary to consummate the Transactions.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement or Section 6.07(f) requires Parent or
the Company to take, or cause to be taken, any action with respect to any of
the assets, businesses or product lines of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, or any combination
thereof, if such action in aggregate would exceed the Detriment Limit. For
purposes of this Agreement, the " _Detriment Limit_ " would be exceeded if the
assets, businesses or product lines required to be divested or held separate
in order to obtain actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations
or terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals under
Antitrust Laws accounted for more than $50,000,000 of revenue of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, for the 12 months ended
November 30, 2010; provided, however, that the parties agree that the
calculation of revenue above shall be measured by reference to the revenue of
the Company and its Subsidiaries (except for Brazil which is covered in the
proviso below) for each overlapping asset, business or product line so
required to be divested or held separate, regardless of whether such assets,
businesses or product lines are those of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries or
the Company and/or its Subsidiaries; provided, further, that with respect to
Brazil, the parties agree that the calculation of revenue above shall be
measured by reference to the revenue of Parent and its Subsidiaries for
products manufactured and sold in Brazil, on a consolidated basis, for the 12
months ended November 30, 2010, for each overlapping asset, business or
product line so required to be divested or held separate, regardless of
whether such assets, businesses or product lines so divested or held separate
are those of Parent and/or its Subsidiaries or the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries. If requested by Parent, the Company will agree to any action
contemplated by this Section 6.07(g), provided that the effectiveness of any
such agreement or action is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. The
foregoing agreement in this Section 6.07(g) is made solely to facilitate the
Closing and does not constitute a representation or admission that the
Merger, if consummated without any modification, would violate any Antitrust
Law or that agreeing to the divestitures, hold separate conditions or other
restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any Person or authority acting
under any Law would not be harmful to the parties.

(h) Parent shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other person relating
to the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Antitrust Law, subject to
the provisions of Section 6.07(b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (i). The
Company shall not make any offer, acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise
engage in negotiations or discussions with any Governmental Authority with
respect to any proposed settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or,
in the event of litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or
scheduling, except as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. The
Company shall use its best efforts to provide full and effective support of
Parent in all material respects in all such negotiations and discussions to
the extent requested by Parent.

 



40 (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, commercially or competitively sensitive
information and materials of a party will be provided to the other party (i)
on an outside counsel-only basis while, to the extent feasible, making a
version in which the commercial or competitively sensitive information has
been redacted available to the other party or (ii) in accordance with the
Clean Team Agreement.

SECTION 6.08 _Public Announcements_. The Company and Parent agree that no
public release or announcement concerning the Transactions shall be issued by
any party without the prior written consent of the Company and Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except
as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable United States securities exchange or regulatory
or governmental body to which the relevant party is subject or submits,
wherever situated, in which case the party required to make the release or
announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to allow the other party or
parties hereto reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance (it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, as well as the timing of any such release
or announcement, shall be at the final reasonable discretion of the disclosing
party).

 

SECTION 6.09 _Employment and Employee Benefits Matters; Other Plans_.

 

(a) From the Effective Time, and subject to Section 6.09(b), the employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries who remain in the employment of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or their Subsidiaries shall (i) be eligible to
participate in all benefit plans and programs provided by Parent and its
Subsidiaries as are provided to similarly situated employees of Parent
and its Subsidiaries, and (ii) be subject to the compensation plans, policies
and practices of Parent and its Subsidiaries applicable to similarly situated
employees.

(b) After the Effective Time, Parent shall make or cause the Surviving
Corporation to make all payments due under any and all applicable bonus or
other agreements between the Company and any of its employees, including all
management stability agreements, long-term incentive bonus agreements and
incentive bonus agreements.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent (i) shall credit each employee
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Effective Time with the
portion of such employees service that is recognized as of the Effective Time
under the Company Benefit Plans (including for vacation purposes) for all
purposes under Parents plans or programs, except for benefit accrual service
under any defined benefit pension plan or to the extent that such crediting
would result in duplication of benefits, and (ii) shall waive any exclusion or
limitation with respect to pre-existing conditions under Parents group
health plan and shall provide that any out-of-pocket health expenses incurred
by an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or his or her covered
dependents prior to the Effective Time in the plan year in which the Closing
occurs shall be taken into account under Parents group health plan for
purposes of satisfying applicable deductible coinsurance and maximum covered
health benefit claims for services rendered on and after the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.10 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts (a) to take all action necessary so that no Takeover Law is or
becomes applicable to the Merger

 



41  or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (b) if
any such Takeover Law is or becomes applicable to any of the foregoing, to
take all action necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Takeover Law on the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

SECTION 6.11 _Company Indebtedness_. In consultation with Parent, the Company
shall cooperate with and provide reasonable assistance to Parent prior to the
Closing (a) to assist Parent in assuming or paying off all indebtedness for
borrowed money and (b) to back or to replace, as necessary, any
outstanding letters of credit or surety bonds maintained or provided by the
Company or its Subsidiaries effective as of the Effective Time.

 

SECTION 6.12 _Non-Solicitation of Employees_. If this Agreement is terminated
prior to the Effective Time, Parent will not and will cause its affiliates
not to, for a period of eighteen (18) months thereafter, without the prior
written consent of the Company, solicit (other than a solicitation by general
advertisement) any person who is (a) an executive officer, senior manager, or
sales manager of the Company or any Subsidiary or (b) an employee of the
Company or any Subsidiary involved in research and development, at the date
hereof or at any time hereafter that precedes such termination, to terminate
his or her employment with the Company or any Subsidiary. Parent agrees that
any remedy at law for any breach by Parent (whether in connection with its own
actions or those of its affiliates) of this Section 6.12 would be inadequate,
and that the Company would be entitled to injunctive relief in such a case.
If it is ever held that this restriction on Parent is too onerous and is not
necessary for the protection of the Company, Parent agrees that any court of
competent jurisdiction may impose such lesser restrictions which such court
may consider to be necessary or appropriate to properly protect the Company.

 

SECTION 6.13 _Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub_. Parent shall take all
action necessary to cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under this
Agreement in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth
in this Agreement.

Agreement under this Section 8.01(h) shall not be available if the Company
willfully and materially breached Section 6.04 in connection with such
Superior Proposal; or

 

(i) by Parent, if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or
their respective Representatives, directly or indirectly, shall have
materially breached any of their covenants or obligations under Section 6.04,
and such breach (if curable) has not been cured within two (2) business days
after notice to the Company.

 

SECTION 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, this Agreement shall forthwith become

Section 6.03(b) (Confidentiality), Section 6.08 (Public Announcements),
Section 6.12 (Non-Solicitation of Employees), this Article VIII (Termination,
Amendment and Waiver) and Article IX (General Provisions) shall survive any

equity for any willful breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

 

SECTION 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_.

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in this Section 8.03, all Expenses incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the
party incurring such 

 



45  Expenses, whether or not the Merger or any other Transaction is consummated;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.03(a) shall relieve any
party from liability at law or in equity for any willful breach of this
Agreement prior to the Termination Date. " _Expenses_ ", as used in this
Agreement, of a party shall include all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including all fees and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers,
financing sources, experts and consultants to a party hereto and its
affiliates) incurred by such party or on its behalf in connection with or
related to the authorization, preparation, negotiation, execution
and performance of this Agreement, the preparation, printing, filing and
mailing of the Proxy Statement (including applicable SEC filing fees), the
solicitation of stockholder approvals, filings under Antitrust Laws and all
other matters related to the closing of the Merger and the other
Transactions.

(b) The parties agree that if this Agreement shall be terminated: 

(i) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(d), then (A) the Company shall pay
Parent the amount of Parents Termination Expenses and (B) if, concurrently
with such termination or within twelve (12) months of the Termination Date an
Acquisition Proposal more favorable from a financial point of view to the
holders of Company Common Stock is consummated, then the Company shall pay
Parent the Termination Fee; or

(ii) by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(e), then Parent shall pay the
Company the amount of the Companys Termination Expenses unless a Material
Adverse Effect has occurred and is continuing such that Section 7.02(d) would
not be satisfied; or

 

(iii) by Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(f), then (A) if, as of
the Company Stockholders Meeting any Acquisition Proposal has been publicly
announced and not withdrawn, the Company shall pay Parent the amount of
Parents Termination Expenses and (B) if, concurrently with such termination
or within twelve (12) months of the Termination Date any Acquisition Proposal
is consummated, the Company shall pay Parent the amount of Parents
Termination Expenses (if not required to be paid pursuant to clause (A)) and
the Termination Fee; or

 

(iv) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(g) or by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.01(h), then the Company shall pay Parent the amount of Parents
Termination Expenses and the Termination Fee; or

(v) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.01(i), then (A) if, at or prior to the
Termination Date, an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced,
the Company shall pay to Parent the amount of Parents Termination Expenses
and (B) if, concurrently with such termination or within twelve (12) months
of the Termination Date any Acquisition Proposal (which need not be the same
Acquisition Proposal as the Acquisition Proposal described above that shall
have been publicly announced on or prior to the Termination Date) is
consummated, the Company shall pay Parent the amount of Parents Termination
Expenses (if not required to be paid pursuant to clause (A)) and the
Termination Fee;

 



46  provided, however, that in any of the events described in clauses (i)
through (v) above, such Termination Expenses or Termination Fee shall not be
payable to the Company or Parent if such party (or, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub) that would be entitled to receive such amount(s) is in breach of
any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements in this
Agreement as of the Termination Date such that the conditions of the Closing
set forth in Section 7.02 or Section 7.03, respectively, would not be
satisfied.

(c) The Termination Fee shall be paid to Parent or its designee in
immediately available funds within two (2) business days of the occurrence of
all of the events giving rise to the obligation to pay the Termination Fee.
The Termination Expenses shall be paid to the appropriate party or its
designee in immediately available funds within five (5) business days after
receipt from such party of reasonable documentation with respect to such
Termination Expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a
termination by the Company pursuant to Section 8.01(h), the Termination Fee
shall be paid concurrent with, and as a condition to the effectiveness of,
such termination.

 

(i) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Fee_ " means an amount
equal to $20,000,000.

 

(ii) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Termination Expenses_ " means an
amount, not to exceed $2,500,000, equal to the reasonably documented Expenses
of the appropriate party.

(d) _Nature of Fees_. It is understood by the parties that in no event shall
the Company be required to pay more than one Termination Fee to Parent. The
parties agree that the agreements contained in this Section 8.03 are an
integral part of the Transactions and the Termination Fee constitutes
liquidated damages and not a penalty. The parties further agree that if the
Company is or becomes obligated to pay a Termination Fee pursuant to this
Section 8.03, the right to receive such Termination Fee and the
Termination Expenses shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent and its
affiliates against the Company and any of its former, current or future
directors, officers, stockholders, affiliates, employees or agents (or any of
their successors or permitted assignees) or against any former, current or
future director, officer, general or limited partner, stockholder, member,
manager, controlling person, affiliate, employee or agent of any of the
foregoing (or any of their successors or permitted assignees) (collectively,
together with the Company, the " _Company Parties_ ") for any loss or damage
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated or for a
breach or failure to perform hereunder or otherwise in connection with this
Agreement, and upon payment of such amounts, none of the Company Parties shall
have any further liability or obligation arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or the Transactions and in no event shall Parent or its affiliates
seek, or be entitled to, any equitable relief or equitable remedies of any
kind whatsoever, including specific performance; provided, however, that
except as expressly provided in this Section 8.03(d), any and all remedies
expressly conferred upon a party to this Agreement (including the right of
the Company or Parent to receive the Termination Expenses) shall be cumulative
with, and not exclusive of, any other rights or remedies contained in this
Agreement, at law or in equity.

(e) _Nonpayment of Fees_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Section 8.03: (i) in the event that the Company shall fail to pay the
Termination Fee or any

 



47  Termination Expenses when due, the Company shall reimburse Parent and Merger
Sub for all reasonable costs and expenses actually incurred or accrued by
Parent or Merger Sub (including legal fees and expenses) in connection with
any action, including the filing of any lawsuit or other legal action, taken
to collect payment, together with interest on the amount of any unpaid fee
from the date such fee was required to be paid at the prime rate as reported
in the Wall Street Journal on the date such fee was required to be paid, and
(ii) in the event that Parent shall fail to pay any Termination Expenses when
due, Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable costs and
expenses actually incurred or accrued by the Company (including legal fees
and expenses) in connection with any action, including the filing of any
lawsuit or other legal action, taken to collect payment, together with
interest on the amount of any unpaid fee from the date such fee was required
to be paid at the prime rate as reported in the Wall Street Journal on the
date such fee was required to be paid.

SECTION 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any
time prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that, after the Company
Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no amendment shall be made except as
allowed under applicable Law. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto, signed
by each of the parties hereto.

SECTION 8.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any obligation or other
act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations
and warranties of any other party contained herein or in any
document delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive compliance with any
agreement of any other party or any condition to its own obligations contained
herein; provided, however, that after the Company Stockholder Approval has
been obtained, no waiver may be made that pursuant to applicable Law requires
further approval or adoption by the stockholders of the Company without such
further approval or adoption. Any such extension or waiver shall be valid if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the party or parties to be
bound thereby. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

(c) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Sections or Exhibits, such
reference shall be to a Section or Exhibit of this Agreement, respectively,
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation". The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not any particular provision of this Agreement. The
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms. References to a person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns. Whenever the context may require, any
pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine, feminine and neuter forms.

SECTION 9.04 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party.
Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the
parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
the Transactions be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

SECTION 9.05 _Disclaimer of Other Representations and Warranties_.
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each acknowledges and agrees that, except
for the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, (a) no
party makes, and has not made, any representations or warranties relating to
itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with the Transactions,
(b) no person has been authorized by any party to make any representation or
warranty relating to itself or its businesses or otherwise in connection with
the Transactions and, if made, such

 



56  representation or warranty must not be relied upon as having been authorized
by such party, and (c) any estimates, projections, predictions, memoranda,
presentations or any other materials or information provided or addressed to
any party or any of its Representatives are not and shall not be deemed to be
or to include representations or warranties except to the extent any such
materials are addressed in such representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement.

SECTION 9.06 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, the
Company Disclosure Letter and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties hereto, or any of them, with respect to
the subject matter hereof and thereof. This Agreement shall not be assigned
(whether pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise), except that
Parent and Merger Sub may assign all or any of their rights and obligations
hereunder (but not under the Confidentiality Agreement) to any direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent; provided, however, that no such
assignment shall relieve the assigning party of its obligations hereunder if
such assignee does not perform such obligations.

SECTION 9.07 _Parties in Interest_. Nothing in this Agreement, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right,
benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this
Agreement other than as specifically provided in Section 6.05.

 

SECTION 9.08 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise
breached. Accordingly, each of (a) the Company and (b) Parent and Merger Sub
(except as set forth in Section 8.03(d)), shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms hereof, including an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, provided that if jurisdiction is not then available in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware, then in any federal court located in the
State of Delaware or any other Delaware state court, this being in addition to
any other remedy to which such party is entitled at law or in equity. Each of
the parties hereby further waives (x) any defense in any action for specific
performance that a remedy at law would be adequate and (y) any requirement
under any law to post security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable
relief.

SECTION 9.09 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware
applicable to contracts executed in and to be performed in that State. All
Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The parties hereto
hereby (a) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by any party hereto and (b) irrevocably waive, and agree
not to assert by way of motion, defense or otherwise, in any such Action, any
claim that any of them is not subject personally to the jurisdiction of the
above-named court, that its property is exempt or immune from attachment or
execution, that the Action is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue
of the Action is improper or that this Agreement or the Transactions may not
be enforced in or by the above-named court.

 



57 SECTION 9.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a
trial by jury with respect to any litigation directly or indirectly arising
out of, under or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions. Each
of the parties hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other
party would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing
waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been
induced to enter into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by,
among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
9.10.

 

SECTION 9.11 _Headings_. The descriptive headings contained in this Agreement
are included for convenience of reference only and shall not affect in any
way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

SECTION 9.12 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile transmission) in one or more counterparts, and by the
different parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when executed
shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

SECTION 9.13 _Currency_. All references to "dollars" or "$" or "US$" in this
Agreement refer to United States dollars, which is the currency used for all
purposes in this Agreement.

 



58 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above by their
respective officers thereunto duly authorized.
