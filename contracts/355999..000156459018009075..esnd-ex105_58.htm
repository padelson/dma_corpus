(a)The RMT Parent Board shall take all such action as may be necessary to

twelve members, consisting of (i) four individuals designated by GPC within
five Business Days of the Closing Date (the "GPC Board Designees"), (ii) four
individuals designated by RMT Parent within five Business Days of the Closing
Date (the "RMT Parent Board Designees") and (iii) four individuals mutually
agreed between RMT Parent and GPC (the "Joint Board Designees"); provided,
that if any of such GPC Board Designee, RMT Parent Board Designee or Joint
Board Designee is unable or unwilling to serve, then GPC, RMT Parent or GPC

of the SEC, the Nasdaq Global Select Market and all other Applicable Laws.

 

(b)During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Merger Effective
Time, RMT Parent and GPC shall consult from time to time regarding the roles
and responsibilities of members of the management of RMT Parent following the
Closing, it being understood that the ultimate decision as to the roles and
responsibilities of members of the management of RMT Parent following Closing

foregoing, RMT Parent and GPC agree that Richard Phillips shall be the Chief
Executive Officer, Rick Toppin shall be the Chief Operating Officer and Janet
Zelenka shall be the Chief Financial Officer of RMT Parent following the
Closing, in each case (i) with roles and responsibilities commensurate with
such titles and (ii) until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified or until such officer's earlier death, resignation or removal;
provided, that if (x) Richard Phillips or Janet Zelenka is unable or unwilling
to so serve, then RMT Parent shall select a replacement reasonably acceptable
to GPC or (y) Rick Toppin is unable or unwilling to so serve, then GPC shall
select a replacement reasonably acceptable to RMT Parent.

Article III 

DELIVERY OF MERGER CONSIDERATION; CONVERSION OF EQUITY AWARDS

 

Exchange Fund

 

.

 

(a)Exchange Agent. Prior to the Merger Effective Time, RMT Parent shall
appoint Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (or another nationally
recognized commercial bank or trust company mutually agreed to by GPC and RMT
Parent) to act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") for the delivery of
the Merger Consideration in accordance with Article II and this Article III.
RMT Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange
Agent, for the benefit of the holders of SpinCo Shares, for exchange in
accordance with Section 2.04 and this Article III promptly after the Merger
Effective Time, book-entry shares representing the Merger Consideration
issuable to holders of SpinCo Shares as of the Merger Effective Time pursuant
to Section 2.04(a) (such book-entry shares of RMT Parent Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto pursuant to
Section 3.01(c) and other amounts payable in accordance with Section 3.01(e),
the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions from RMT Parent delivered to the Exchange Agent as of the
Closing, deliver the Merger Consideration out of the Exchange Fund as
contemplated by this Agreement. The cash portion of the Exchange Fund

   

shall be invested by the Exchange Agent as directed by RMT Parent. Any
interest or other income from such investments of the Exchange Fund shall be
paid to and become income of RMT Parent. Except as contemplated by Section
3.01(g), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than as
specified in this Section 3.01(a).

 

(b)Exchange Procedures.

 

(i)As promptly as practicable after the Merger Effective Time, RMT Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to distribute the shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock into which the shares of SpinCo Common Stock that were distributed in
the Distribution have been converted pursuant to the Merger to the Persons who
received SpinCo Common Stock in the Distribution. Each Person entitled to
receive SpinCo Common Stock in the Distribution shall be entitled to receive
in respect of the shares of SpinCo Common Stock distributed to such Person a
book-entry authorization representing the number of whole shares of RMT Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this
Section 3.01(b) (and cash in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock, as contemplated by Section 3.01(e), together with any dividends or
distributions and other amounts pursuant to Section 3.01(c)). The Exchange
Agent shall not be entitled to vote or exercise any rights of ownership with
respect to RMT Parent Common Stock held by it from time to time hereunder,
except as contemplated by Section 3.01(c).

 

(ii)Until exchanged as contemplated by this Section 3.01, each SpinCo Share
shall be deemed at all times after the Merger Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon surrender of such SpinCo Share, without interest,
the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of any fractional shares of RMT Parent
Common Stock that the holder of such SpinCo Share may be entitled to receive
pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or other distributions such
holder is entitled to receive pursuant to Section 3.01(c).

 

(c)Distributions with Respect to Undistributed Shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Merger Effective
Time with respect to RMT Parent Common Stock shall be paid with respect to any
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock that are not able to be distributed by the
Exchange Agent promptly after the Merger Effective Time, whether due to a
legal impediment to such distribution or otherwise. Subject to the effect of
abandoned property, escheat or other Applicable Laws, following the
distribution of any such previously undistributed shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock, there shall be paid to the record holder of such shares of RMT Parent
Common Stock, without interest, (i) at the time of the distribution, the
amount of cash payable in lieu of a fractional share of RMT Parent Common
Stock to which such holder may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and the
amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Merger Effective
Time but prior to the distribution of such whole shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock and a payment date subsequent to the distribution of such whole shares
of RMT Parent Common Stock.

   

(d)No Further Rights in SpinCo Common Stock. All shares of RMT Parent Common
Stock issued upon the exchange of SpinCo Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of Article II and this Article III (including any cash paid pursuant to
Section 3.01(c) or Section 3.01(e)) shall be deemed to have been issued or
paid, as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares of SpinCo Common Stock.

 

(e)No Fractional Shares. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be
issued upon the surrender for exchange of SpinCo Common Stock, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote, or to
any other rights of a stockholder of RMT Parent. All fractional shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock that a holder of shares of SpinCo Common Stock otherwise
would be entitled to receive as a result of the Merger shall be aggregated by
the Exchange Agent. The Exchange Agent shall cause the whole shares obtained
thereby to be sold on behalf of such holders of shares of SpinCo Common Stock
who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, in the open market or otherwise, in each
case at then-prevailing market prices, and in no case later than five Business
Days after the Merger Effective Time. Subject to Section 3.01(i), the Exchange
Agent shall pay the net proceeds thereof, subject to the deduction of
brokerage charges, commissions and Transfer Taxes, on a pro rata basis,
without interest, as soon as practicable to the holders of SpinCo Common Stock
that otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock in the Merger. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock to holders of SpinCo Common Stock is solely
for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to RMT Parent of
issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained for
consideration.

 

(f)Adjustments to Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be
adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock
split, subdivision, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into RMT Parent Common Stock or SpinCo Common Stock),
extraordinary cash dividend, reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification, combination, exchange of shares or other like change with
respect to RMT Parent Common Stock or SpinCo Common Stock (other than, in the
case of SpinCo Common Stock, to the extent contemplated in the Separation
Agreement) with a record date occurring on or after the date of this Agreement
and prior to the Merger Effective Time, other than the issuance of stock by
SpinCo in connection with the Separation, the Internal Reorganization Cash
Payments, or the other Contemplated Transactions; provided that nothing in
this Section 3.01(f) shall be construed to permit SpinCo, RMT Parent or Merger
Sub to take any action with respect to its securities that otherwise is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

(g)Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including
proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed to the former
holders of SpinCo Shares on the one-year anniversary of the Merger Effective
Time shall, subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law, be
delivered to RMT Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of SpinCo Shares
who have not theretofore received shares of RMT Parent Common Stock in
accordance with this Article III shall thereafter look only to RMT Parent for
the Merger Consideration to which they are entitled pursuant to Section
2.04(a), any cash in lieu of fractional shares of RMT Parent Common Stock to
which they may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(e) and any dividends or
other distributions with respect to the RMT Parent

   

Common Stock to which they may be entitled pursuant to Section 3.01(c)
(subject to any abandoned property, escheat or similar law).

 

(h)No Liability. None of RMT Parent, GPC, SpinCo, Merger Sub, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person for any
portion of the Exchange Fund (or dividends or distributions with respect to
RMT Parent Common Stock) or any cash delivered to a public official in
accordance with any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 

(i)Withholding Rights. Each of GPC, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent and RMT Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amount as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
Applicable Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to
the Persons otherwise entitled thereto in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made.

 

Stock Transfer Books

 

.

 

From and after the Merger Effective Time, the stock transfer books of SpinCo
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
SpinCo Shares thereafter on the books or records of SpinCo.

 

No Appraisal Rights

 

.

 

In accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL, no appraisal rights shall be
available to holders of SpinCo Shares in connection with the Merger.

 

Treatment of GPC Equity Awards

 

.

 

(a)GPC SARs. Each GPC SAR held by a SpinCo Business Employee that was granted
in calendar years 2015, 2016 or 2017 and that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Merger Effective Time, whether vested or unvested, without any action
on the part of any Party or the SpinCo Business Employee, shall be converted
into stock appreciation rights of RMT Parent ("RMT Parent SARs") on the same
terms and conditions that governed such GPC SARs immediately prior to the
Merger Effective Time, as set forth in the applicable GPC Stock Plan and the
relevant award agreement in respect thereof, except that the number of shares
of RMT Parent Common Stock that will be subject to the RMT Parent SAR shall be
equal to the number of shares of GPC Common Stock subject to the GPC SAR
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, multiplied by the Equity
Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock, and the per share exercise price for the shares of RMT
Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such RMT Parent SARs shall be
equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of
GPC Common Stock applicable to the GPC SAR by the Equity Conversion Ratio,
rounded up to the nearest whole cent. For the avoidance of doubt, any GPC SAR
held by a SpinCo Business Employee that was granted in any year other than
calendar years 2015, 2016 or 2017 shall not be converted into an RMT Parent
SAR pursuant to the terms of this Section 3.04(a) and (i) such GPC SAR shall
remain subject to the terms and conditions that governed such GPC SARs
immediately prior to

   

the Merger Effective Time, (ii) GPC shall retain all Liabilities with respect
to such GPC SARs and (iii) RMT Parent shall have no Liability with respect
thereto.

 

(b)GPC Restricted Stock Units. Each GPC RSU held by a SpinCo Business Employee
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, without
any action on the part of any Party or the SpinCo Business Employee, shall be
converted into RMT Parent RSUs on the same terms and conditions that governed
such GPC RSUs immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, as set forth in
the applicable GPC Stock Plan and the relevant award agreement in respect
thereof, except that the number of RMT Parent RSUs into which each GPC RSU
shall be converted shall equal the number of outstanding GPC RSUs as of
immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, multiplied by the Equity
Conversion Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole share; provided that (i)
with respect to any GPC RSUs for which an applicable performance period
remains in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, performance
shall be measured based on actual performance through the Closing Date for
purposes of determining the number of GPC RSUs outstanding as of immediately
prior to the Merger Effective Time that will convert to RMT Parent RSUs
pursuant to this Section 3.04(b) and (ii) with respect to any GPC RSUs for
which an applicable performance period has ended as of immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time, performance shall be measured based on actual
performance through the end of the applicable performance period for purposes
of determining the number of GPC RSUs outstanding as of immediately prior to
the Merger Effective Time that will convert to RMT Parent RSUs pursuant to
this Section 3.04(b).

 

(c)Miscellaneous. The Parties shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
give effect to the provisions of this Section 3.04. In furtherance and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, RMT Parent shall prepare and file
with the SEC a registration statement or statements registering a number of
shares of RMT Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill RMT Parent's
obligations under this Section 3.04.

Financial Information

 

.

 

(a)Section 4.07(a) of the GPC Disclosure Letter sets forth the audited
combined balance sheets of the SPR Entities as of December 31, 2015, 2016 and
2017 and the audited combined statements of income and comprehensive income,
net parent investment and cash flows of the SPR Entities for the years ended
December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 together with a report on the financial
statements from the independent accounts for the SPR Entities (collectively,
the "SpinCo Financial Statements").

   

(b)The SpinCo Financial Statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied during the periods covered thereby (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto). The SpinCo Financial Statements present
fairly, in all material respects, the combined financial position and the
combined results of operations of the SpinCo Business for the periods covered
thereby (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal and recurring
year-end adjustments that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, a SpinCo Material Adverse Effect).

 

(c)With respect to the SpinCo Business, GPC maintains, and has maintained, a
standard system of accounting established and administered in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis. Except as would not be material to the

internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that
(i) transactions in the SpinCo Business are executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations, (ii) transactions in the
SpinCo Business are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements of the SpinCo Business in conformity with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis and to maintain accountability for assets, (iii) access to
assets of the SpinCo Business is permitted only in accordance with
management's general or specific authorizations and (iv) the recorded
accountability for assets of the SpinCo Business is compared with the existing
assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to
any differences. To the knowledge of GPC, since December 31, 2016, no GPC
Entity has identified or been made aware of any material fraud by any employee
of a GPC Entity who has, or had, a role in the preparation of the SpinCo
Financial Statements or the internal control over financial reporting utilized
by the SpinCo Business.

 

(d)GPC has timely filed all certifications and statements required by (i) Rule
13a-14 or Rule 15d-14 under the Exchange Act or (ii) 18 U.S.C. Section 1350
(Section 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002) with respect to all applicable
GPC SEC Documents. GPC maintains disclosure controls and procedures required
by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, and such controls and
procedures are effective to ensure that all material information concerning
GPC and its Subsidiaries is made known on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of GPC's SEC filings and other public
disclosure documents. As used in this Section 4.07, the term "filed" shall be
broadly construed to include any manner in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC.

 

(e)Except (i) as set forth in the SpinCo Financial Statements or the notes
thereto, (ii) as specifically contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, or (iii) as set forth in Section 4.07(e) of the GPC
Disclosure Letter, since December 31, 2017, the SpinCo Companies have not
incurred any Liabilities that are of a nature that would be required to be
disclosed on a combined balance sheet of the SpinCo Business or in the notes
thereto prepared in conformity with GAAP, other than Liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business or Liabilities that would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a SpinCo Material Adverse
Effect.

 

(f)Upon the consummation of the SpinCo Financing Transactions and upon the
consummation of other Contemplated Transactions, assuming the accuracy of the
representations and warranties of RMT Parent and Merger Sub contained in
Article V, (i)

   

SpinCo will not be insolvent, (ii) SpinCo will not be left with unreasonably
small capital, (iii) SpinCo will not have incurred debts or other Liabilities
beyond its ability to pay such debts or other Liabilities as they mature and
(iv) the capital of SpinCo will not be impaired.

 

(g)Except as would not be material to the SpinCo Companies, taken as a whole,
(i) all inventory of the SpinCo Business consists of a quality and quantity
usable and salable in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, except for obsolete, damaged, defective or slow-moving items that
have been written off or written down to fair market value or for which
adequate reserves have been established and (ii) the quantities of each item
of inventory are not excessive, but are reasonable in the present
circumstances of the SpinCo Business.

(a)SpinCo has delivered to RMT Parent a true, complete and fully executed copy
of a commitment letter, including (i) all exhibits, schedules, attachments and
amendments to such commitment letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) any associated fee letters (together, the "SpinCo
Commitment Letter") from the lead arrangers, lenders and other financing
sources party thereto (together with all additional lead arrangers, lenders
and other financing sources added to the SpinCo Commitment Letter or any
Alternative SpinCo Commitment Letter, the "SpinCo Lenders"), pursuant to
which, among other things, the SpinCo Lenders have committed to SpinCo to
provide, or cause to be provided, to SpinCo debt financing in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the bank financing contemplated by the SpinCo
Commitment Letter, being referred to as the "SpinCo Financing"). As of the
date of this Agreement, (x) the SpinCo Commitment Letter has not been amended,
restated, waived or modified and (y) the respective commitments contained in
the SpinCo Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn, modified or rescinded in
any respect. Except for the SpinCo Commitment Letter (together with all
ancillary documents referenced therein), there are no side letters or other
Contracts, instruments or other commitments, obligations or arrangements
(whether written or oral) related to the funding of the full amount of the
SpinCo Financing.

 

(b)As of the date of this Agreement, the SpinCo Commitment Letter, in the form
so delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of SpinCo and, to the knowledge of SpinCo, the other parties
thereto (in each case, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and to general principles of equity). As of the date of
this Agreement (assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
and undertakings of RMT Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement for such
purpose), (x) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of SpinCo under any term or condition of the SpinCo Commitment
Letter and (y) SpinCo is not aware of any fact, event or any other occurrence
that makes any of the representations or warranties of SpinCo in the SpinCo
Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect. SpinCo has fully paid,
or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees, any other fees or any
other amounts required by the SpinCo Commitment Letter to be paid on or before
the date of this Agreement. On the Distribution Date, assuming the SpinCo
Financing is funded in accordance with the SpinCo Commitment Letter, the
proceeds of the SpinCo Financing will be sufficient to pay the Internal
Reorganization Cash Payments (the "SpinCo

   

Financing Transactions"). Other than as set forth in the SpinCo Commitment
Letter, there are no conditions precedent to the funding of the full amount of
the SpinCo Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, and subject to the
satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in Section 8.01 and Section 8.02,
SpinCo has no reason to believe that any of the conditions to the SpinCo
Financing that are required to be satisfied by it or any other party to the
SpinCo Commitment Letter as a condition to the obligations under the SpinCo
Commitment Letter will not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the SpinCo
Financing contemplated by the SpinCo Commitment Letter will not be available
to SpinCo immediately prior to, or on, the Distribution Date.

any material SpinCo Intellectual Property; provided, in each case, that any

applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Applicable Laws relating to or affecting

Company has any obligation or which are maintained, contributed to or

Subsidiaries is in compliance in all material respects with ERISA, the Code
and all other material Applicable Laws. Since January 1, 2013, all employer
and employee contributions required to have been made by GPC to each U.S. GPC
Plan have, in all material respects, been timely made. There is no material
Proceeding pending, or to the knowledge of GPC threatened, with respect to any
U.S. SpinCo Plan, other than ordinary course claims for benefits. Each U.S.
SpinCo Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS, or an
application for a favorable determination by the IRS has been timely filed and
is currently pending, and, to the

   

knowledge of GPC, nothing has occurred that would reasonably be expected to
result in a loss of the Tax-qualified status of such U.S. SpinCo Plan under
Section 401(a) of the Code.

 

(d)No Liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
GPC or any Person that is a member of a "controlled group of corporations"

"affiliated service group" with GPC, in each case, as defined in Sections
414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code (each, an "ERISA Affiliate") that has not
been satisfied in full, and, to the knowledge of GPC, no condition exists that
presents a material risk to GPC or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring any such
Liability, other than Liability for premiums due the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation (which premiums have been paid when due). No U.S. GPC Plan that is
subject to Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code (a
"Title IV Plan") or any trust established thereunder has incurred any
"accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section 302 of ERISA and
Section 412 of the Code), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the
most recent fiscal year of each Title IV Plan ended prior to the Closing.
Neither GPC nor any of its ERISA Affiliates has, within the preceding six

plan" (as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA) or incurred any Liability under
Section 4204 of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.

 

(e)Since January 1, 2013, each Non-U.S. GPC Plan has been administered in
compliance in all material respects with its terms and operated in compliance
in all material respects with Applicable Laws. Each Non-U.S. GPC Plan required
to be registered or approved by a non-U.S. governmental entity has been so
registered or approved and has been maintained in good standing with
applicable regulatory authorities, and, to the knowledge of GPC, no event has
occurred since the date of the most recent approval or application therefor
relating to any such Non-U.S. GPC Plan that could reasonably be expected to
materially affect any such approval relating thereto or increase the costs
relating thereto in a manner material to GPC. Each Non-U.S. GPC Plan is funded
or insured in material compliance with Applicable Law.

 

(f)Except as set forth in Section 4.15(f)(1) of the GPC Disclosure Letter,
none of the execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, the Internal
Reorganization, the Distribution or the consummation of the Merger or any
other Contemplated Transaction (alone or in conjunction with any other event,
including any termination of employment) will (i) entitle any SpinCo Business
Employee to any material compensation or benefit, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or trigger any payment or funding, of any material
compensation or benefit or trigger any other material obligation under any GPC
Plan or (iii) result in any breach or violation of or default under, or limit
GPC's right to amend, modify or terminate, any GPC Plan, in each case except
as provided in this Agreement or pursuant to Applicable Law. Except as
disclosed in Section 4.15(f)(2) of the GPC Disclosure Letter, no amounts
payable under the GPC Plans will fail to be deductible for federal income Tax
purposes by virtue of Section 280G of the Code as a result of the occurrence
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, either alone or in
combination with another event.

quantities of each item of inventory are not excessive, but are reasonable in
the present circumstances of RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries.

 

Financing

 

.

   

(a)RMT Parent has delivered to GPC a true, complete and fully executed copy of
a commitment letter, including (i) all exhibits, schedules, attachments and
amendments to such commitment letter in effect as of the date of this
Agreement and (ii) any associated fee letters (solely in the case of the
administrative agent fee letter, redacted in a customary manner solely with
respect to fees payable and economic terms (other than covenants) that are
confidential, none of which redacted provisions would reduce the aggregate
principal amount of the RMT Financing, impose additional conditions with
respect thereto, or otherwise affect the enforceability or availability of the
RMT Financing) (together, the "RMT Commitment Letter" and, together with the
SpinCo Commitment Letter, the "Commitment Letters") from the lead arrangers,
lenders and other financing sources party thereto (together with all
additional lead arrangers, lenders and other financing sources added to the
RMT Commitment Letter or any Alternative RMT Commitment Letter, the "RMT
Lenders" and, together with the SpinCo Lenders, the "Lenders"), pursuant to
which, among other things, the RMT Lenders have, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth therein, committed to RMT Parent to provide or cause to
be provided to Essendant Co. (the "RMT Borrower") debt financing in the
aggregate amount set forth therein (the bank financings contemplated by the
RMT Commitment Letter, being referred to as the "RMT Financing"; the RMT
Financing together with the SpinCo Financing, each a "Financing" and together
the "Financings"). As of the date of this Agreement, (x) the RMT Commitment
Letter has not been amended, restated, waived or modified and (y) the
respective commitments contained in the RMT Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn, modified or rescinded in any respect. Except for the RMT Commitment
Letter (together with all ancillary documents referenced therein), there are
no side letters or other Contracts, instruments or other commitments,
obligations or arrangements (whether written or oral) related to the funding
of the full amount of the RMT Financing.

 

(b)As of the date of this Agreement, the RMT Commitment Letter, in the form so
delivered, is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of RMT Parent and, to the knowledge of RMT Parent, the other
parties thereto (in each case, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and
remedies generally and to general principles of equity). As of the date of
this Agreement (assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties
and undertakings of each of GPC and SpinCo under this Agreement for such
purpose), (x) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
on the part of RMT Parent under any term or condition of the RMT Commitment
Letter and (y) RMT Parent is not aware of any fact, event or any other
occurrence that makes any of the representations or warranties of RMT Parent
in the RMT Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material respect. RMT Parent
has fully paid, or caused to be fully paid, any and all commitment fees, any
other fees or any other amounts required by the RMT Commitment Letter to be
paid on or before the date of this Agreement. At the Closing, assuming the RMT
Financing is funded in accordance with the RMT Commitment Letter, the proceeds
of the RMT Financing will be sufficient to repay all outstanding obligations
under the Existing RMT Credit Agreement and pay all related fees and expenses
associated with the foregoing (the "RMT Financing Transactions"). Other than
as set forth in the RMT Commitment Letter, there are no conditions precedent
to the funding of the full amount of the RMT Financing. As of the date of this
Agreement, and subject to the satisfaction of all the conditions set forth in
Section 8.01 and Section 8.03, RMT Parent has no reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the RMT Financing that are required to be satisfied by it or
any other party to the RMT Commitment

   

Letter as a condition to the obligations under the RMT Commitment Letter will
not be satisfied on a timely basis or that the RMT Financing contemplated by
the RMT Commitment Letter will not be available to RMT Borrower on the Closing
Date.

Disclosure Letter, there is no Proceeding by or against RMT Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries pending or, to the knowledge of RMT Parent, threatened in
writing that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an RMT Parent Material Adverse Effect or would reasonably be
expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation by RMT Parent or
Merger Sub of the Contemplated Transactions.

Non-U.S. RMT Parent Plan is funded or insured in material compliance with
Applicable Law.

Person (or any of such Person's Representatives) who has made a written, bona
fide proposal or offer with respect to a Competing RMT Parent Transaction that
did not arise or result from any material breach of Section 7.03(a) if, prior
to furnishing such information and entering into such discussions, the RMT
Parent Board has (A) determined, in its good faith judgment (after consulting
with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation and outside legal
counsel) that such proposal, offer or request constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal, (B) provided written notice to GPC of

given Person and (C) obtained (to the extent not already obtained) from such
Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement (it being understood that an
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and any related agreements shall not
include any provision granting such Person exclusive rights to negotiate with
RMT Parent or having the effect of prohibiting RMT Parent from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement) and, promptly upon its execution, delivered
to GPC a copy of such Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(d)Except as set forth in this Section 7.03(d), neither the RMT Parent Board
nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify, modify, amend or fail
to make, or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify, modify or amend the RMT
Parent Recommendation, (ii) make any public statement or take any action
inconsistent with the RMT Parent Recommendation or (iii) approve or adopt, or
recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly propose to approve or

   

adopt, any Competing RMT Parent Transaction (any of the actions described in
(i), (ii) or (iii), a "Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation").
Notwithstanding the foregoing:

 

(i)the RMT Parent Board may make a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation if
(A) other than in connection with or as a result of the making of a Competing
RMT Parent Transaction, a material development or change in circumstances that
was not known or, with respect to developments or changes in circumstances
relating to RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries, reasonably foreseeable to the RMT
Parent Board on the date of this Agreement and occurs or arises after the date
of this Agreement, which material development or change in circumstances
becomes known to the RMT Parent Board prior to the RMT Parent Stockholders'
Meeting (such material development or change in circumstances being referred
to as an "Intervening Event") (it being understood that in no event shall the
following constitute an Intervening Event (i) the receipt, existence or terms
of a Competing RMT Parent Transaction or (ii) any event, circumstance, change
in or effect on the SpinCo Business that, individually or in the aggregate, is
or would reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business,
assets, results of operations or the financial condition of the SpinCo
Business, taken as a whole, unless such events, circumstances, changes or
effects have had or would reasonably be expected to have a SpinCo Material
Adverse Effect), (B) the RMT Parent Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that an Intervening
Event has occurred and a failure to make a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation would be inconsistent with the RMT Parent Board's fiduciary
duties to RMT Parent or its stockholders under Applicable Law, (C) the RMT
Parent Board does not effect, or cause RMT Parent to effect, a Change in the
RMT Parent Recommendation at any time within three Business Days, or such
shorter period in the event that the RMT Parent Stockholders' Meeting is
scheduled to occur in less than three Business Days, after GPC receives
written notice from RMT Parent that the RMT Parent Board has determined that
an Intervening Event requires the RMT Parent Board to effect, or cause RMT
Parent to effect, a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation and describing in
reasonable detail the circumstances underlying such determination (provided, a
new notice shall be required with respect to any material change in
circumstances and a new notice period of three Business Days shall begin) and
(D) during such applicable period RMT Parent engages in good faith
negotiations with GPC (to the extent that GPC desires to negotiate) to amend
this Agreement in such a manner that obviates the need for the RMT Parent
Board to effect, or cause RMT Parent to effect, a Change in the RMT Parent
Recommendation; or

 

(ii)if at any time prior to the receipt of the RMT Parent Stockholder Approval
and in response to the receipt of an offer or proposal with respect to a
Competing RMT Parent Transaction that did not arise or result from any
material breach of Section 7.03(a), the RMT Parent Board determines in its
good faith judgment (after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation and outside legal counsel), that such offer or proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and determines in its good faith judgment,
after consulting with its outside legal counsel, that a failure to make a
Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation with respect to such Superior Proposal
would be inconsistent with the RMT Parent Board's fiduciary duties to RMT
Parent or its stockholders under Applicable Law, then the RMT Parent Board
may, with respect to

   

such Superior Proposal (x) make a Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation or
(y) cause RMT Parent to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(g)
in order to enter into a definitive agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal if, in each case:

 

(1)RMT Parent has provided written notice to GPC (a "Notice of Superior
Proposal") advising GPC that the RMT Parent Board has received a Superior
Proposal promptly after the RMT Parent Board determines it has received a
Superior Proposal, stating that the RMT Parent Board intends to make a Change
in the RMT Parent Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(g) and describing in reasonable detail the terms and conditions
of such Superior Proposal; and

 

(2)GPC does not, within three Business Days of receipt of the Notice of
Superior Proposal (the "Notice Period"), make a written offer or proposal to
revise the terms of this Agreement (any such offer, a "Revised Transaction
Proposal") in a manner that the RMT Parent Board determines in its good faith
judgment, after consulting with a financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation and outside legal counsel, to be at least as favorable to RMT
Parent's stockholders as such Superior Proposal; provided, however, that,
during the Notice Period, RMT Parent shall negotiate in good faith with GPC
(to the extent GPC desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised Transaction
Proposal; provided, further, that any amendment to the terms of such Superior
Proposal during the Notice Period shall require a new written notice of the
material terms of such amended Superior Proposal from RMT Parent and an
additional three Business Day Notice Period, including with respect to RMT
Parent's obligations to negotiate in good faith with GPC.

 

(e)Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit RMT Parent or the RMT
Parent Board from (i) disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated
by Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from
issuing a "stop, look and listen" statement pending disclosure of its position
thereunder or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the RMT Parent
Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with its outside
legal counsel, that a failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent
with the RMT Parent Board's fiduciary duties to RMT Parent or its stockholders
under Applicable Law; provided, however, that (1) in no event shall this
Section 7.03(e) affect the obligations specified in Section 7.03(d) and (2)
any such disclosure (other than issuance by RMT Parent of a "stop, look and
listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act) that addresses or relates to the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the RMT Parent Board with
respect to this Agreement or an Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a
Change in the RMT Parent Recommendation unless the RMT Parent Board in
connection with such communication publicly states that its recommendation
with respect to this Agreement has not changed or refers to the prior
recommendation of the RMT Parent Board, without disclosing any Change in the
RMT Parent Recommendation.

 

(f)GPC agrees that it will not, nor will it permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
and that it will instruct and cause its Representatives not to, directly or
indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), or take any other action to knowingly
facilitate, any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including
any proposal or offer to GPC's stockholders), with respect to any Competing
SpinCo

   

Transaction, (ii) enter into, maintain, continue or otherwise engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person in furtherance
of inquiries or to obtain a proposal or offer with respect to a Competing
SpinCo Transaction, (iii) agree to, approve, endorse, recommend or consummate
any Competing SpinCo Transaction, (iv) enter into any Competing SpinCo
Transaction Agreement or (v) resolve, propose or agree or authorize any
Representative, to do any of the foregoing. GPC shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, and shall instruct and cause its Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated all existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than RMT Parent and its Affiliates)
conducted prior to the execution of this Agreement by GPC or any of its
Representatives with respect to a Competing SpinCo Transaction. GPC shall not,
and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, and GPC shall instruct and cause its
Representatives not to, release any third party from, or waive any provision
of, any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or one of its
Affiliates is a party in connection with a Competing SpinCo Transaction. GPC
shall, and shall cause it Subsidiaries to, promptly request each Person (other
than RMT Parent and its Affiliates) that has heretofore executed a
confidentiality agreement with GPC or any of its Subsidiaries in connection
with such Person's consideration of a Competing SpinCo Transaction (whether by
merger, acquisition of stock or assets or otherwise), to return (or if
permitted by the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all
information required to be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such
Person under the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement and, if
requested by RMT Parent, to seek to enforce such Person's obligation to do so.
GPC shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-four hours after GPC
attains knowledge thereof) notify RMT Parent after the receipt by GPC or any
of its Representatives of any proposal, inquiry, offer or request (or any
amendment thereto) with respect to a Competing SpinCo Transaction, including
any request for discussions or negotiations and any request for information
relating to GPC or any of its Affiliates with respect to the SpinCo Business,
or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of GPC or
any of its Affiliates with respect to the SpinCo Business. The receipt by GPC
of a proposal in respect of a Competing SpinCo Transaction shall not in any
way or manner alter, hinder or delay GPC or SpinCo from satisfying its
obligations under this Agreement.

 

Access to Information

 

.

 

(a)From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice,
GPC shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) afford RMT Parent and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and
books and records of the SpinCo Business and (ii) furnish to the authorized
Representatives of RMT Parent such additional available information regarding
the SpinCo Business (or copies thereof), as RMT Parent may from time to time
reasonably request; provided, that (x) any such access or furnishing of
information shall be conducted at RMT Parent's expense, during normal business
hours, under the supervision of GPC's personnel and in such a manner as not to
unreasonably interfere with the normal operations of the SpinCo Business, (y)
all requests for access pursuant to this Section 7.04(a) shall be made in
writing and shall be directed to and coordinated with a person or persons
designated by GPC in writing and (z) RMT Parent shall not, and shall cause its
Representatives not to, contact any of the employees, customers, distributors
or suppliers of any GPC Entity, other than any such customers, distributors or
suppliers that are also customers, distributors or suppliers of RMT Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, in connection with the Contemplated Transactions,
whether in person or by telephone, mail, or other means of communication,

   

without the specific prior written authorization of GPC. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, GPC shall not be required to
provide any access or disclose any information to RMT Parent or its
Representatives if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to (A)
jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver of, any attorney-client or other
legal privilege, (B) contravene any Applicable Law, fiduciary or other duty or
any agreement or (C) result in the loss of protection of any proprietary
information or trade secrets of any GPC Entity; provided that GPC shall give
notice to RMT Parent of the fact that it is withholding such access or
information pursuant to clauses (A), (B) or (C) of this Section 7.04(a) and
thereafter RMT Parent and GPC shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such access or information, as applicable, to be
provided, or made available, in a manner that would not reasonably be expected
to jeopardize such privilege, contravene such Applicable Law, fiduciary or
other duty or agreement, or result in any loss of such protection of
proprietary information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, neither RMT Parent nor any of its Representatives shall be allowed
to sample or analyze any soil or groundwater or other environmental media, or
any building material, without the prior written consent of GPC, which consent
may be withheld in the sole discretion of GPC.

 

(b)From the date of this Agreement until the Closing, upon reasonable notice,
RMT Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) afford GPC and its
authorized Representatives reasonable access to the offices, properties and
books and records of RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries and (ii) furnish to the
authorized Representatives of GPC such additional available information
regarding RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries (or copies thereof), as GPC may from
time to time reasonably request; provided, that (x) any such access or
furnishing of information shall be conducted at GPC's expense, during normal
business hours, under the supervision of the personnel of RMT Parent or its
Subsidiaries and in such a manner as not to unreasonably interfere with the
normal operations of RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries, (y) all requests for
access pursuant to this Section 7.04(b) shall be made in writing and shall be
directed to and coordinated with a person or persons designated by RMT Parent
in writing and (z) GPC shall not, and shall cause its Representatives not to,
contact any of the employees, customers, distributors or suppliers of any RMT
Parent Entity, other than any such customers, distributors or suppliers that
are also customers, distributors or suppliers of the SpinCo Business, in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions, whether in person or by
telephone, mail, or other means of communication, without the specific prior
written authorization of RMT Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, RMT Parent shall not be required to provide any access or
disclose any information to GPC or its Representatives if such disclosure
could reasonably be expected to (A) jeopardize, or result in a loss or waiver
of, any attorney-client or other legal privilege, (B) contravene any
Applicable Law, fiduciary or other duty or any agreement or (C) result in the
loss of protection of any proprietary information or trade secrets of any RMT
Parent Entity; provided that the RMT Parent shall give notice to GPC of the
fact that it is withholding such access or information pursuant to clauses
(A), (B) or (C) of this Section 7.04(b) and thereafter GPC and RMT Parent
shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
access or information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a
manner that would not reasonably be expected to jeopardize such privilege,
contravene such Applicable Law, fiduciary or other duty or agreement, or
result in any loss of such protection of proprietary information.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither GPC nor
any of its Representatives shall be allowed to sample or analyze any soil or

   

groundwater or other environmental media, or any building material, without
the prior written consent of RMT Parent, which consent may be withheld in the
sole discretion of RMT Parent.

 

(c)The Parties shall cooperate in good faith to prepare and implement a joint
communication plan for communications with their respective customers,
distributors and suppliers in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.
Each Party shall reasonably and in good faith cooperate with the other Parties
to appropriately address any identified non-compliance with such joint
communication plan.

 

Directors' and Officers' Indemnification

 

.

 

(a)The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less
favorable with respect to indemnification than are set forth in the bylaws of
SpinCo, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified
for a period of six years from the Merger Effective Time in any manner that
could reasonably be expected to affect adversely the rights thereunder of
individuals who, at or prior to the Merger Effective Time, were directors,
officers, employees or agents of SpinCo, unless such modification shall be
required by Applicable Law.

 

(b)In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its assets to any Person, then,
and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, or at RMT
Parent's option, RMT Parent, shall assume the obligations set forth in this
Section 7.05.

 

(c)At or prior to the Closing, SpinCo shall obtain a prepaid directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy or policies (i.e., a "tail" policy),
which policy or policies shall cover those directors and officers of the SPR
Entities who are currently covered by any GPC Entity's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy or policies on terms with respect to
coverage and amount that are no less favorable than those of such policy or
policies for an aggregate period of not less than six years from the Closing
Date with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred at or
before the Closing, including with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents

 

.

 

(a)Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to (i) promptly obtain all authorizations, consents, orders and
approvals of all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for
its execution and delivery of, and the performance of its obligations pursuant
to, this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, (ii) cooperate fully
with the other Parties in promptly seeking to obtain all such authorizations,
consents, orders and approvals and (iii) provide such other information to any
Governmental Authority as such Governmental Authority may reasonably request
in connection herewith. Each Party agrees to, and shall cause its respective
Affiliates to, make promptly its respective filing, if necessary, pursuant to
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws under which filing is required or
under which the Parties reasonably mutually determine that filing is

   

advisable with respect to the Contemplated Transactions and to supply as
promptly as practicable to the appropriate Governmental Authorities any
additional information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant
to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws. The Parties shall determine the
jurisdictions in which filings will be made under the Antitrust Laws within
ten Business Days of the date of this Agreement. The applicable Party (or its
Affiliate) making any notice or filing with any Governmental Authority as
required by this Section 7.06 shall pay all applicable filing or notice fees
required in connection therewith; provided that RMT Parent or GPC, as
applicable, shall reimburse the other for its portion of all such filing fees
such that RMT Parent and GPC shall bear the cost of such fees evenly.

 

(b)Without limiting the generality of the undertakings of the Parties pursuant
to Section 7.06(a), and notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates to, use
reasonable best efforts to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Laws that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the Parties to
close the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any
event prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
require GPC, RMT Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to (x) propose,
negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets, properties or
businesses or (y) undertake any efforts or to take any action if the taking of
such efforts or action is or would reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a material and adverse effect on the
assets, Liabilities, business, results of operations or condition (financial
or otherwise) of (A) SpinCo and the SpinCo Companies, taken as a whole, or of
(B) RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each of such actions, a
"Burdensome Condition"); and neither GPC, nor SpinCo, nor any of their
Subsidiaries shall take any action that has the effect of, or agree with any
Governmental Authority to, any Burdensome Condition without the prior written
consent of RMT Parent. In addition, each Party shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on
the merits any Proceeding by any Governmental Authority or any other Person to
avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any decree, order or
judgment (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the
Closing prior to the Termination Date; provided, however, that notwithstanding
the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
require GPC, RMT Parent or any of their respective Affiliates to continue
litigation beyond the Termination Date or other termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article IX.

 

(c)Each Party shall promptly notify the other Parties of any communication it
or any of its Representatives receives from any Governmental Authority
relating to the ability to consummate the Contemplated Transactions and permit
the other Parties to review in advance any proposed communication by such
Party to any Governmental Authority. The Party providing communications for
review under the foregoing sentence shall consider, in good faith, the
suggestions made by the other Parties. None of the Parties shall agree to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filings, investigation (including any settlement of an investigation),
litigation or other inquiry relating to the Contemplated Transactions unless
it consults with the other Parties in advance and, to the extent permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting. Each Party shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, coordinate and cooperate

   

fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing such
assistance as the other Parties may reasonably request in connection with the
foregoing and in seeking early termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Law. Each Party shall, and
shall cause its Representatives to, provide each other with copies of all
correspondence, filings or communications between them or any of their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and
the Contemplated Transactions; provided, however, that materials may be
redacted (i) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements or
Applicable Law and (ii) as necessary to address reasonable attorney-client or
other privilege or confidentiality concerns; provided, further, that a Party
may designate information that it views to be commercially sensitive or
competitively sensitive to be viewed only by outside antitrust counsel for the
other Parties, and such designation shall be honored by the Parties receiving
that information. This Section 7.06(c) shall not apply with respect to the
Internal Reorganization.

 

(d)Each Party agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
enter into any transaction, or any agreement to effect any transaction
(including any merger, acquisition or other business combination) that could
reasonably be expected to make it more difficult, or to increase the time
required, to (i) obtain the expiration or termination of the waiting period
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, or under any other Applicable
Law, in respect of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) avoid the entry of, the
commencement of litigation seeking the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order that could
reasonably be expected to materially delay or prevent the consummation of the
Contemplated Transactions or (iii) obtain all authorizations, consents, orders
and approvals of Governmental Authorities necessary or reasonably mutually
determined as advisable for the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions.

 

Financing

 

.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7.07, RMT Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to (i) cause
the conditions and comply with the obligations that are set forth in the RMT
Commitment Letter applicable to, and within the control of or that require the
cooperation of, RMT Parent to be fulfilled (or waived, if deemed advisable by
RMT Parent) in a timely fashion in accordance with its terms, (ii) maintain
the RMT Commitment Letter in effect until the earlier of the initial funding
of the RMT Financing or the date that the RMT Financing Agreements (as defined
below) become effective, (iii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect
thereto, on the terms and conditions contained therein (including the "market
flex" provisions) or on such other terms that would not be prohibited by
clauses (i) through (iv) of Section 7.07(d) (the "RMT Financing Agreements")
and (iv) if all conditions precedent under the RMT Commitment Letter or the
RMT Financing Agreements have been satisfied, on the Closing Date, cause the
RMT Lenders to fund the RMT Financing and RMT Borrower to consummate the RMT
Financing Transactions if all conditions to Closing contained in Article VIII
are, or on the Closing Date can reasonably be expected to be, satisfied or
waived (by the applicable party that is the beneficiary of such condition). In
the event any funds in the amounts set forth in the RMT Commitment Letter or
the RMT Financing Agreements, or any portion thereof, become unavailable on
the terms and conditions (including any applicable "flex" terms) contemplated
in the RMT Commitment Letter or the RMT

   

Financing Agreements, RMT Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to use
reasonable best efforts, subject to Section 7.07(d), to obtain promptly any
such portion from alternative sources, including on terms materially no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to RMT Parent than those set forth in the RMT
Commitment Letter (in each case as determined in the reasonable discretion of
RMT Parent), in an amount sufficient, when added to the portion of the RMT
Financing that is available, to finance the RMT Financing Transactions (the
"RMT Alternative Financing") and provide promptly to GPC a copy of any new
financing commitment letter and any associated fee letters (solely in the case
of any administrative agent fee letter, redacted in a customary manner solely
with respect to the fees payable and economic terms (other than covenants)
that are confidential, none of which redacted provisions would reduce the
aggregate principal amount of such RMT Alternative Financing, impose
additional conditions with respect thereto, or otherwise affect the
enforceability or availability of such RMT Alternative Financing)
(collectively, the "Alternative RMT Commitment Letter"); provided that the
terms of any such RMT Alternative Financing must be consistent with the
Intended Tax Treatment, as reasonably determined by GPC. In the event any RMT
Alternative Financing is obtained, notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any reference in this Agreement to "RMT Financing" shall include
"RMT Alternative Financing," any reference to "RMT Commitment Letter" shall
include the "Alternative RMT Commitment Letter," any reference to "RMT
Lenders" shall include the financial institutions providing such RMT
Alternative Financing, and any reference to "RMT Financing Agreements" shall
include any definitive agreements with respect to the Alternative RMT
Commitment Letter, and all obligations of RMT Parent pursuant to this Section
7.07 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent as RMT Parent's
obligations with respect to the RMT Financing. For the avoidance of doubt, if
the Marketing Period has ended, the RMT Financing is available, and all
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or
waived or will be satisfied or waived at the Closing, RMT Parent shall take
all actions within its control reasonably necessary to allow RMT Borrower to
incur the indebtedness provided under the RMT Financing to consummate the RMT
Financing Transactions.

 

(b)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Section 7.07, GPC and SpinCo
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause the conditions and comply with the obligations that are
set forth in the SpinCo Commitment Letter applicable to, and within the
control of or that require the cooperation of, GPC or SpinCo to be fulfilled
(or waived, if deemed advisable by GPC or SpinCo) in a timely fashion in
accordance with its terms, (ii) maintain the SpinCo Commitment Letter in
effect until the earlier of the initial funding of the SpinCo Financing or the
date that the SpinCo Financing Agreements (as defined below) become effective,
(iii) negotiate definitive agreements with respect thereto, on terms and
conditions acceptable to RMT Parent and contained therein (including the
"market flex" provisions) or on such other terms acceptable to RMT Parent that
would not be prohibited by Section 7.07(e) (the "SpinCo Financing Agreements"
and, together with the RMT Financing Agreements, the "Financing Agreements")
and (iv) if all conditions precedent under the SpinCo Commitment Letter or the
SpinCo Financing Agreements have been satisfied, cause the SpinCo Lenders to
fund the SpinCo Financing prior to or substantially contemporaneously with the
Distribution and to consummate the SpinCo Financing Transactions if all
conditions to Closing contained in Article VIII are, or, on the Closing Date
can reasonably be expected to be, satisfied or waived (by the applicable party
that is the beneficiary of such condition). In the event any funds in the
amounts set forth in the SpinCo Commitment Letter or the SpinCo Financing
Agreements, or any portion thereof, become unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including

   

any applicable "flex" terms) contemplated in the SpinCo Commitment Letter or
the SpinCo Financing Agreements, GPC and SpinCo shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, in consultation with RMT Parent, use reasonable best
efforts to cause SpinCo to obtain promptly any such portion from alternative
sources, on terms acceptable to RMT Parent, in an amount sufficient, when
added to the portion of the SpinCo Financing that is available, to finance the
SpinCo Financing Transactions (the "SpinCo Alternative Financing" and,
together with any RMT Alternative Financing, the "Alternative Financings" and
each, an "Alternative Financing") and provide promptly to RMT Parent a copy of
any new financing commitment letter and any associated fee letters (the
"Alternative SpinCo Commitment Letter"); provided that the terms of any such
SpinCo Alternative Financing must be consistent with the Intended Tax
Treatment, as reasonably determined by GPC. In the event SpinCo Alternative
Financing is obtained, any reference in this Agreement to "SpinCo Financing"
shall include "SpinCo Alternative Financing," any reference to "SpinCo
Commitment Letter" shall include the "Alternative SpinCo Commitment Letter,"
any reference to "SpinCo Lenders" shall include the financial institutions
providing such Alternative Financing, and any reference to "SpinCo Financing
Agreements" shall include any definitive agreements with respect to the
Alternative SpinCo Commitment Letter, and all obligations of GPC and SpinCo
pursuant to this Section 7.07 shall be applicable thereto to the same extent
as GPC's and SpinCo's obligations with respect to the SpinCo Financing. For
the avoidance of doubt, if the SpinCo Financing is available and all
conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied or
waived or will be satisfied or waived at the Closing, SpinCo shall, and GPC
shall cause SpinCo to, take all actions within its control reasonably
necessary to cause SpinCo to incur the indebtedness provided under the SpinCo
Commitment Letter or the SpinCo Financing Agreements to consummate the SpinCo
Financing Transactions, including by executing and delivering to the SpinCo
Lenders the SpinCo Financing Agreements and related certificates, instruments
and documents contemplated thereby, which, in each case, shall be in form and
substance satisfactory to RMT Parent.

 

(c)RMT Parent and GPC shall each give the other prompt written notice (i) of
any material breach (or threatened material breach) or default (or any event
or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements, (ii) of the
receipt of any written notice of any actual or threatened withdrawal,
repudiation or termination of either Financing by any of the Lenders, (iii) of
the receipt of any written notice of any material dispute or disagreement
between or among any of the parties to the Commitment Letters or the Financing
Agreements, (iv) of any amendment or modification of, or waiver under, the
Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements to which such Person (or its
Affiliate) is a party or (v) if for any reason either believes in good faith
that it or its Affiliates will not be able to timely obtain all or any portion
of the RMT Financing or SpinCo Financing, as applicable, on the terms and
conditions and in the manner or from the sources (including the RMT
Alternative Financing and the SpinCo Alternative Financing, where applicable)
contemplated by the RMT Commitment Letter or the SpinCo Commitment Letter, as

Financial Statements

 

.

 

(a)GPC shall use its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable,
and no later than 50 calendar days after the end of any fiscal quarter and 60
calendar days after the end of the 2018 fiscal year, prepare and furnish to
RMT Parent copies of financial statements of the SPR Entities as of and for
the periods ending on any fiscal quarterly and annual periods ending after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing Date, in each case together
with the notes thereto, and prepared from the books and records of the SPR
Entities and in accordance with GAAP with no exception or qualification
thereto (it being understood, however, that the SPR Entities have not been
operating historically as separate "standalone" entities or a separate
reporting segment and, therefore, the financial statements of the SPR Entities
will reflect certain adjustments necessary to be presented on a stand-alone
basis in accordance with GAAP and SEC requirements) applied on a consistent
basis through the periods involved (except as may

   

otherwise be required under GAAP) and the rules and regulations of the SEC,
including the requirements of Regulation S-X, and, in the case of the combined
financial statements of the SPR Entities for any fiscal year, GPC shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause such financial statements to be audited
and accompanied by a report of the independent accountants for the SPR
Entities and, in the case of any quarterly period, GPC shall use reasonable
best efforts to cause such financial statements to be reviewed by the
independent accountants for the SPR Entities. When delivered, such financial
statements shall present fairly in all material respects the combined
financial position and combined results of operations of the SPR Entities as
of the dates and for the periods shown therein. GPC acknowledges that RMT
Parent's obligations under Section 7.01 depend, in part, on GPC's compliance
with this Section 7.15, and therefore RMT Parent shall be afforded a
reasonable period to comply with such obligations based upon the timing of GPC
providing the financial statements contemplated in this Section 7.15.

 

(b)In connection with the filing of the RMT Parent Registration Statement and
other SEC filings, GPC shall use its reasonable efforts during the pre-Closing
period and after the Closing to (i) cooperate with RMT Parent to prepare pro
forma financial statements that comply with the rules and regulations of the
SEC to the extent required for SEC filings, including the requirements of
Regulation S-X and (ii) provide and make reasonably available upon reasonable
notice the senior management employees of GPC to discuss the materials
prepared and delivered pursuant to this Section 7.15. RMT Parent shall,
promptly upon request by the GPC, reimburse GPC for all documented and
reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by GPC or its Subsidiaries for actions
taken at the request of RMT Parent pursuant to this Section 7.15(b) following
the Closing. GPC will use reasonable best efforts to procure, at its expense,
the delivery of the consents of its independent accountants required to be
filed with the Form S-4 Registration Statement or any future registration
statement until such independent accountant consents are no longer required.

 

SpinCo Authorized Shares

 

.

 

Prior to the Distribution, GPC and SpinCo shall take all such actions
necessary to amend and restate SpinCo's organizational documents, in form

or indirectly, engage in any business that directly competes with the SpinCo

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prohibit (i) GPC or any
GPC Entity from (A) engaging in the businesses conducted by the GPC Entities
(excluding the SpinCo Business) as of the date hereof, (B) owning no more than
5% in the aggregate of any class of capital stock or other equity interest of
any Person engaged in a Competitive Business, (C) acquiring and operating any
Person that

   

operates a diversified business that did not derive more than 15% of its total
revenue from Competitive Businesses in its most recently completed fiscal year
or (D) performing their obligations under the Transaction Documents, (ii) GPC
from engaging with any Person that is not its Affiliate in any merger of GPC,
any tender offer for GPC's publicly traded securities or any other similar
business combination involving GPC and a Person that is not its Affiliate or
(iii) transactions between or among two or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of
GPC.

provided, to each SpinCo Business Employee who continues to be employed

employed during the Continuation Period by RMT Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof, with (i) the same base salary or wage
rate and short- and long-term incentive opportunities that were provided to
the Continuing Employee by GPC or its Subsidiaries (including the SpinCo
Companies) immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) participation in
employee benefit plans and programs that are substantially comparable in the
aggregate to those benefits provided under the employee benefit plans and
programs of RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries to similarly situated employees of
RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries; provided that nothing in this Section 7.18 or
otherwise in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee the
right to continue in employment following the Merger Effective Time, or is
intended to interfere with RMT Parent's, the Surviving Corporation's or any of
their respective Subsidiaries' rights (subject to Applicable Law) to terminate
the employment of any Continuing Employee for any reason or no reason
following the Merger Effective Time. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, for the six (6) month period beginning on the Closing Date, RMT
Parent shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, in effect the severance and
layoff plans applicable to Continuing Employees immediately before the Closing
Date and set forth on Section 7.18(a) of the GPC Disclosure Letter.

 

(b)In furtherance and not in limitation of the provisions of this Section
7.18, RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries shall, as of the Merger Effective Time,
recognize the Liabilities and obligations for earned or accrued but unused
vacation time in respect of each Continuing Employee ("Accrued Vacation"). RMT
Parent and its Subsidiaries shall allow Continuing Employees to utilize such
Accrued Vacation subject to any maximums for vacation carryovers as in effect
as of the Merger Effective Time under the SpinCo Companies' applicable
vacation policies. During the Continuation Period, Continuing Employees shall
receive vacation benefits under the terms of the vacation benefit policies of
the SpinCo Companies applicable to similarly situated employees of the SpinCo
Companies, in each case after giving credit for each Continuing Employee's
service with GPC and its Subsidiaries (including the SpinCo Companies) to the
same extent such service would have been recognized by GPC and its
Subsidiaries (including the SpinCo Companies).

   

(c)The group health plan, disability plan and other plans established or made
available by RMT Parent and its Subsidiaries for the benefit of Continuing
Employees and their dependents and other beneficiaries in accordance with this
Section 7.18 shall not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any
preexisting condition for a Continuing Employee or his or her dependents or
other beneficiaries except to the extent such condition was taken into account
under comparable plans of GPC and its Subsidiaries (including the SpinCo
Companies) and shall credit all such individuals with any deductibles and out-
of-pocket maximums incurred or paid by or on behalf of such individuals for
the calendar year which includes the Closing Date. Each Continuing Employee
shall receive full credit under each plan, program, policy or other
arrangement for his or her service as an employee of GPC or its Subsidiaries
(including the SpinCo Companies) on the same basis that he or she would have
received such credit if such service had been completed as an employee of RMT
Parent or its Subsidiaries for purposes of satisfying any service requirement
to receive compensation or to participate in any such plan, program, policy or
other arrangement and any service requirement to receive the benefit provided
under each such plan, program, policy or other arrangement.

 

(d)With respect to each bonus or other cash incentive or sales incentive plan
in which a Continuing Employee participates, for the year in which the Closing
occurs, immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time, as set forth on
Section 7.18(d) of the GPC Disclosure Letter (the "Bonus Plans"), RMT Parent
agrees to maintain, or to cause its Subsidiaries to maintain, the Bonus Plans
as in effect immediately prior to the Merger Effective Time until the end of
the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, and RMT Parent or its
Subsidiaries shall pay to each such Continuing Employee a bonus under the
applicable Bonus Plan for the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs
in the amount determined by GPC in accordance with the terms of such Bonus
Plan and GPC's past practice promptly following receipt by RMT Parent of
written notice from GPC advising RMT Parent of the amount of each such bonus.
GPC shall promptly pay to RMT Parent (or such Subsidiary of RMT Parent as RMT
Parent shall request) within fifteen (15) Business Days following a request by
RMT Parent, a cash amount equal to the amount of such bonus that becomes
payable to such Continuing Employee pursuant to the preceding sentence,
multiplied by the number of days in the performance period that occurred prior
to the Closing Date over the total number of days in the performance period,
as well as an additional amount relating to the employer portion of employment
taxes required to be paid with respect to such pro rata portion of such bonus
(collectively, the "GPC Bonus Payments"); provided, that the GPC Bonus
Payments shall not include any annual bonuses paid pursuant to the Retention
Agreements (as defined in the Separation Agreement).

 

(e)As soon as practicable following the Merger Effective Time, RMT Parent (i)
shall cover (or cause to be covered) each Continuing Employee who is based
primarily in the United States and who participated in the GPC 401(k) Savings
Plan (the "GPC 401(k) Plan") under one or more defined contribution plans and
trusts intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code (collectively, the
"RMT Parent DC Plan") and (ii) shall cause the RMT Parent DC Plan to accept,
in accordance with Applicable Law, a "direct rollover" (within the meaning of
Section 401(a)(31) of the Code) of each Continuing Employee's account balances
(including earnings thereon through the date of transfer and including
promissory notes evidencing any outstanding loans) under the GPC 401(k) Plan
if such rollover to the RMT Parent DC Plan is

   

elected in accordance with Applicable Law and each applicable plan by such
Continuing Employee.

 

(f)The GPC Supplemental Retirement Plan and the GPC Tax Deferred Savings Plan
will be terminated with respect to Continuing Employees as of the Closing
Date, and all benefits accrued by Continuing Employees under those plans will
be paid out by GPC in accordance with the applicable plan terms.

 

(g)No provision of this Section 7.18 shall create any third party beneficiary
or other rights in any employee or former employee (including any beneficiary
or dependent thereof) of the SpinCo Companies in respect of continued
employment (or resumption of employment) with RMT Parent, the SpinCo Companies
or any of their respective Affiliates, and no provision of this Agreement
shall create any such rights in any such individuals in respect of any
benefits that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee
benefit plan or arrangement which has been or may be established by GPC, the
SpinCo Companies, RMT Parent or any of their respective Affiliates. Subject to
Applicable Law, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, no provision of
this Agreement shall constitute a limitation on rights to amend, modify or
terminate, either before or after the Merger Effective Time, or shall
constitute or be treated as an amendment, modification or termination of, any
employee benefit plan or arrangement which has been or may be established by
GPC, the SpinCo Companies, RMT Parent or any of their Affiliates.

 

(h)GPC has used reasonable best efforts to provide to RMT Parent an accurate
schedule setting forth the SpinCo Business Employees as of the date of this
Agreement, which schedule GPC shall use reasonable best efforts to update as
of ten Business Days prior to the Closing.

(a)by either RMT Parent or GPC, if the Closing shall not have occurred by
11:59 p.m. New York City time on April 12, 2019 (the "Initial Termination
Date"); provided,

   

however, that if the conditions set forth in Section 8.01(e) or Section
8.01(f) shall not have been satisfied by the Initial Termination Date, but all

of (i) thirty days following RMT Parent's written notice to GPC and SpinCo of

Fee in cash in immediately available funds;

 

(ii)if RMT Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(g), then,
prior to or substantially concurrently with RMT Parent's notice of such
termination, RMT Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to GPC the Termination
Fee in cash in immediately available funds;

   

(iii)if (A) (1) RMT Parent or GPC terminates this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.01(a) or Section 9.01(c) or (2) GPC terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01(d) on the basis of a breach of a covenant or
agreement, (B) prior to the termination of this Agreement, a Competing RMT

prior to the date that is twelve months after the date of such termination,
RMT Parent enters into a Competing RMT Parent Transaction Agreement or
consummates a Competing RMT Parent Transaction (whether or not the applicable
Competing RMT Parent Transaction is the same as the original Competing RMT
Parent Transaction publicly announced or publicly known), then, on the earlier
of the date RMT Parent enters into a Competing RMT Parent Transaction
Agreement or consummates any Competing RMT Parent Transaction, RMT Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid to GPC the Termination Fee in cash in
immediately available funds; provided that, solely for purposes of this
Section 9.03(a)(iii), the references to "20%" in the definition of Competing
RMT Parent Transaction shall be deemed to refer to "50%."

 

(b)The Parties agree that if RMT Parent or GPC terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 9.01(c), RMT Parent shall pay to GPC in cash in
immediately available funds an amount equal to the lesser of all of GPC's

Parties agree that in no event shall RMT Parent be required to pay the

(d)Except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, including this Section
9.03 and the Separation Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be

case other than Expenses of each Party's legal counsel (all such Expenses,
collectively, the "Shared Expenses"), if (x) the Contemplated Transactions are
consummated, then the Shared Expenses shall be treated as an adjustment to the
SpinCo Special Cash Payment as set forth in the Separation Agreement or (y)
the Contemplated Transactions are not consummated and this Agreement is
terminated, then, promptly after such termination, GPC shall reimburse RMT
Parent, or RMT Parent shall reimburse GPC, in either case as necessary to
ensure that GPC and RMT Parent each bear one-half of the Shared Expenses.

   

(e)GPC agrees that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary
(including Section 9.02), in the event that the Termination Fee is paid in
accordance with this Section 9.03, the payment of the Termination Fee shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of GPC, its Subsidiaries, stockholders,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees and Representatives against the RMT
Parent or any of its Representatives or Affiliates or any Lender or Lender
Related Party for, and in no event will GPC or any other such Person seek to

as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated, (ii) the
termination of this Agreement, (iii) any Liabilities or obligations arising
under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or (iv) any
claims or actions arising out of or relating to any breach, termination or
failure of or under this Agreement, and upon payment of the Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section 9.03, neither RMT Parent, nor any Representative
or Affiliate of RMT Parent nor any Lender or Lender Related Party shall have
any further Liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(f)The Parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.03
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In
the event that RMT Parent shall fail to pay the Termination Fee or the Expense
Reimbursement, the amount of such payment shall be increased to include the
costs and expenses incurred or accrued by or on behalf of GPC (including fees
and expenses of counsel) in connection with the collection under and
enforcement of this Section 9.03, together with interest on such unpaid
Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement commencing on the date that the
Termination Fee became due, at a rate of interest equal to the Interest Rate.

other than the State of New York.

 

Dispute Resolution, Consent to Jurisdiction

 

.

 

(a)Any Proceeding seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter
arising out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the Contemplated
Transactions shall be brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the Delaware
Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any state or federal court within the State of Delaware), and each of the
Parties hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and of
the appropriate appellate courts) in any such Proceeding and waives any
objection to venue laid therein. Process in any such Proceeding may be served
on any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the State of
Delaware. Without limiting the foregoing, RMT Parent, GPC and SpinCo agree
that service of process upon such Party at the address referred to in Section
10.02 (or such other address as may be specified in accordance with Section
10.02 shall be deemed effective service of process upon such Party). EACH OF
THE PARTIES HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING (INCLUDING ANY COUNTERCLAIM) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
RELATING TO OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE CONTEMPLATED
TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION AGAINST ANY LENDER OR LENDER RELATED
PARTY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMMITMENT LETTERS OR
THE FINANCING AGREEMENTS OR THE PERFORMANCE THEREOF, IN EACH CASE WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR
OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN
INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE CONTEMPLATED TRANSACTIONS, AS
APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS SET
FORTH IN THIS Section 10.11.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything in Section 10.11(a) to the contrary, and without
limiting anything set forth in Section 10.18, each of the parties hereto
agrees that it will not bring or support any suit, action or other Proceeding
(whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against any
Lender or Lender Related Party in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to any Financing or, if applicable, any
Alternative Financing, or the performance thereof, in any forum other than any
New York State court or federal court sitting in the County of New York and
the Borough of Manhattan (and appellate courts thereof). The parties hereto
further agree that all of the provisions of the preceding clause (a) relating
to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any suit, action or other Proceeding
referenced in this clause (b).

 

Severability

 

.

   

Any provision of this Agreement that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective only to the extent
of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of
such provision in any other jurisdiction. The application of such invalid or
unenforceable provision to Persons or circumstances other than those as to
which it is held invalid or unenforceable shall be valid and be enforced to
the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law. To the extent any provision of
this Agreement is determined to be prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, or determined to be impermissible by any Governmental Authority,
each of the Parties agrees to use reasonable commercial efforts to substitute
one or more valid, legal and enforceable provisions that, insofar as
practicable, implement the purposes and intent of the prohibited,
unenforceable, or impermissible provision.

 

Captions

 

.

 

The captions herein are included for convenience of reference only and shall
be ignored in the construction or interpretation hereof.

 

Specific Performance

 

.

 

Each Party acknowledges that money damages would be both incalculable and an
insufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement by such Party and that
any such breach would cause the other Parties irreparable harm. Accordingly,
each Party also agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach
of the provisions of this Agreement by such Party, the other Parties shall be
entitled to equitable relief without the requirement of posting a bond or
other security, including in the form of injunctions and orders for specific
performance, in addition to all other remedies available to such other Parties
at law or in equity. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Parties agree that each Party shall be entitled to enforce specifically the
other Parties' obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (including the obligation to consummate the Closing and the RMT
Parent Share Issuance and the obligations with respect to the Financing), if
the conditions set forth in Article VIII have been satisfied (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) or waived
(where permissible under Applicable Law). The Parties agree that they will not
contest the appropriateness of specific performance as a remedy.

 

Payments

 

.

 

(a)Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, all payments by a Party to another Party under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document shall be paid by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account in the United States designated by
the recipient when due. Any amount remaining unpaid beyond its due date,
including disputed amounts that are ultimately determined to be payable, shall
bear interest at the Interest Rate. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein or in any other Transaction Document, in no event shall the
amount or rate of interest due and payable exceed the maximum amount or rate
of interest allowed by Applicable Law.

   

(b)Any payment made to GPC from SpinCo or to SpinCo from GPC will be treated
as provided under Section 3.03(a) of the Tax Matters Agreement.

 

No Third-Party Beneficiaries

 

.

 

This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by, only the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to, or
shall confer upon, any other Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, including any rights of employment for any specified period, under
or by reason of this Agreement, other than (a) Section 7.05 (which is intended
to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by
such Persons), (b) Section 10.17 (which is intended to be for the benefit of
the Persons covered thereby and may be enforced by such Persons) and (c) the

terms, (b) the rights and obligations of the Parties set forth in Section 7.07
or (c) the rights of the Lenders and the Lender Related Parties under Section
10.16.

 

Non-Recourse

 

.

 

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary (but subject to the
last sentence of this Section 10.18), each GPC Entity hereby waives any rights
or claims against any Lender or Lender Related Party in connection with this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents (including any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby) and the Financings, whether at
law or equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise. Subject to the last sentence
of this Section 10.18 in no event shall any GPC Entity, and each GPC Entity
agrees not to, (A) seek to enforce this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement or the other

Party for any reason, including in connection with commitments in respect of
any Financing or, if applicable, any Alternative Financing or the obligations
of the Lenders and the Lender Related Parties thereunder. Nothing in this

Liabilities of the parties to each Commitment Letter to each other pursuant
thereto, including the right of SpinCo to enforce the SpinCo Commitment Letter
in accordance with its terms or (b) the rights, obligations and Liabilities of
the parties hereto to each other or in connection herewith.
