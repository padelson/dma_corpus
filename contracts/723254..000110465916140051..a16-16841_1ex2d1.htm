Merger_ ") with the Minnesota Secretary of State and shall make all other

Merger shall become effective at such time (the " _Effective Time_ ") as the
Articles of Merger are duly filed with the Minnesota Secretary of State (or at
such later time as may be specified in the Articles of Merger).

 



 

ARTICLE II

 



 

 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws 
of the Surviving Corporation; Directors and Officers of the Surviving
Corporation_

incorporation of the Surviving Corporation as in effect immediately prior to

articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as set forth in _Exhibit A_ (the "
_Charter_ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

2.2 _Bylaws_. The parties hereto will take all actions necessary so that the
bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time
will be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation (the " _Bylaws_ "), until duly
amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



 

2.3 _Directors_. The parties hereto will take, or cause to be taken, all
actions necessary so that the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the

in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 



 

2.4 _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time will, from and after the Effective Time, be the officers of the Surviving

accordance with the Charter and Bylaws.

 



 

ARTICLE III

 



 

 _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
Exchange of Certificates_

 



 

3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or the holder of any capital stock of the Company:

 



      
 

 



 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of Class A Common Stock, par value
$0.50 per share, of the Company (each, a " _Share_ " or, collectively, the "
_Shares_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent and Shares owned by the Company or
any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company (collectively,
the " _Cancelled Shares_ "), and (ii) Shares that are owned by shareholders ("
_Dissenting Shareholders_ ") that have perfected and not withdrawn a demand
for appraisal rights pursuant to Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA ("
_Dissenting Shares_ " and, together with the Cancelled Shares, the " _Excluded
Shares_ ")) will be converted into the right to receive $97.50 per Share (the
" _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all of the
Shares will cease to be outstanding, will be cancelled and will cease to
exist, and each certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of
the Shares (other than Excluded Shares) and any Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) held in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") will thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration,
without interest.

 



 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share will cease to be
outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor and
will cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any
Dissenting Share to receive any payment under _Section 3.2(g)_.

 



 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will
be converted into one share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 



 

3.2 _Exchange of Certificates_.

 



 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will make
available or cause to be made available to a paying agent selected by Parent
with the Companys prior approval, which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed (the " _Paying Agent_ "), amounts in immediately available cash
sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying
Agent to make payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to
_Section 3.1(a)_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange
Fund_ "). Until disbursed in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Paying Agent will invest the Exchange Fund as directed by
Parent; _provided_ , that (i) such investments shall be an obligation of, or
guaranteed by, the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks and (ii) no
such investment (or losses thereon) shall affect the amount of Per Share
Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Shares pursuant to _Section
3.1(a)_. To the extent that there are losses with respect to such investments,
or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons below the level required to
make prompt cash payment of the aggregate amount sufficient to pay the Per
Share Merger Consideration pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_, Parent will promptly
replace or restore the cash in the Exchange Fund lost through such investments
or other events so as to ensure that the Exchange Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment will become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable under

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 3.1(a)_ will be promptly returned to Parent. No later than five
Business Days prior to the Closing, Parent shall enter into an agreement with
the Paying Agent, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company
(which confirmation of satisfaction shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), to effect the applicable terms of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event
within three Business Days thereafter), Parent will cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Record Holder of Shares represented by Certificates (other than
with respect to Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form
specifying that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits
of loss in lieu of the Certificates as provided in _Section 3.2(f)_) to the
Paying Agent and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section
3.2(f)_), in exchange for the amount to which such Record Holder is entitled
as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_. Upon delivery of such
letter of transmittal by any Record Holder of Shares (other than with respect
to Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly executed in accordance with its
instructions, and such other documents as the Paying Agent or Parent may
reasonably require, and the surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Shares (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(f)_), such
Record Holder will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount
by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such Record Holder (less any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(h)_) equal to the product of (x) the number of
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate (or subject to such affidavit
of loss in lieu thereof as provided in _Section 3.2(f)_) and (y) the Per
Share Merger Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith
be cancelled, without payment or accrual of any interest. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the
procedures described above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable
letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by
the Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

 



 

(c) _Book-Entry Shares_. No holder of Book-Entry Shares shall be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to
receive pursuant to this Article III. In lieu thereof and subject to the
following sentence, each registered holder of one or more Book-Entry Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) shall automatically upon the Effective Time be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor an amount in cash equal to the
product obtained by multiplying (x) the aggregate number of Shares represented
by such holders Book-Entry Shares that were converted into the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as a result of the Merger pursuant
to _Section 3.1(a)_ by (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the Book-
Entry Shares shall forthwith be cancelled, without payment or accrual of any
interest. The Paying Agent shall accept such Book-Entry Shares upon compliance
with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to
effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange
practices.

 



 

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there will be no transfers
on the stock transfer books of the Company of any Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior

 



      
 

 



 

to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is
presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent for
transfer, it will be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder of the Certificate is entitled
pursuant to this _Article III_.

 



 

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments of the Exchange Fund) that remains
unclaimed 180 calendar days after the Effective Time will be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation. Any Record Holder (other than with respect to Excluded
Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ will
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share
Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 3.2(h)_), without any interest thereon, (i) upon due
surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 3.2(f)_) or with respect to Book-Entry Shares, upon
adherence with this _Section 3.2_ and (ii) upon delivery of a letter of
transmittal in customary form that is provided promptly to such Record Holder
by the Surviving Corporation, if applicable, and such other documents as
reasonably required, in each case, to the Surviving Corporation.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person will be liable to any former holder of Shares
for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 



 

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate will have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary
amount and upon such terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with
respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount
(after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section
3.2(h)_) equal to the number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate multiplied by the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

(g) _Appraisal Rights_. Each Dissenting Share outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by a Dissenting Shareholder who has not voted in
favor of the Plan of Merger and who has properly demanded appraisal for its
Shares in accordance with Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA and who
has otherwise complied with all applicable provisions of Sections 302A.471 and
302A.473 of the MBCA, shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Merger Consideration, but the Dissenting Shareholder of such Dissenting
Share shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, unless such Dissenting Shareholder fails to
perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses the right to appraisal under Sections
302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA. If, either before or after the Effective
Time, such Dissenting Shareholder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses the
right to appraisal under Sections 302A.471 and 302A.473 of the MBCA, each
Share held by that Dissenting Shareholder shall no longer be considered
Dissenting Shares and shall thereupon be deemed to automatically be converted
into, and to have become exchanged for, as of the Effective Time, the right to
receive the Per Share Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
3.1(a)_. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice (and in any event within
two Business Days) of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and
proceedings with respect to such

 



      
 

 



 

demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent, the Company shall
not voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or offer to settle or
settle, any such demands.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and Paying
Agent and their Affiliates will be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
amounts payable to any person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment
under the Code, or any other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts (i) will be
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) will be treated for
all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

 



 

(i) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any
other party hereto shall be liable to a holder of the Shares for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 



 

3.3 _Treatment of Stock Plans_.

 



 

(a) _Company Options_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of an option to purchase Shares granted under the
Stock Plans (each, a " _Company Option_ ") (i) the vesting of each Company
Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be accelerated in full immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
each Company Option that remains outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and
(iii) each holder of each such Company Option shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to be paid an amount in cash (without
interest) equal to the product of (x) the total number of Shares previously
subject to such Company Option and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share
Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share of such Company Option,
less any required withholding Taxes (the " _Option Cash Payment_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Company Option granted
after calendar year 2016, to the extent the terms of such Company Option
provide for such Company Option to become vested on a pro-rata basis upon the
Closing and for the remaining unvested portion of such Company Option to
become automatically forfeited upon the Closing, such Company Option will not
become vested by reason of clause (i) in the preceding sentence and no Option
Cash Payment will be made with respect to the portion of such Company Option
that is automatically forfeited upon the Closing in accordance with the terms
of such Company Option. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
the Option Cash Payments promptly following the Effective Time. Any Company
Option with an exercise price equal to, or in excess of, the Per Share Merger
Consideration will be cancelled at the Effective Time for no consideration.

 



 

(b) _Restricted Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any holder of an award of restricted Shares granted under the
Stock Plans (" _Restricted Stock_ "), each award of Restricted Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become vested,
subject to the conditions set forth in (i) below, if such conditions are
applicable,

 



       
 

 



 

immediately prior to the Effective Time and no longer subject to restrictions,
(i) in the case of Restricted Stock subject to performance-based vesting
conditions that have not been satisfied, if any, with respect to the number of
shares of Restricted Stock determined as if the applicable performance goals
had been achieved at the target level of performance at the end of the
applicable performance period, and (ii) in the case of Restricted Stock not or
no longer subject to performance-based vesting conditions, with respect to the
total number of shares of such Restricted Stock, and in either case such
vested and unrestricted Shares shall be treated as described in _Section
3.1(a)_ of this Agreement, except that the Per Share Merger Consideration paid
to the holder shall be reduced by any required withholding Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Restricted Stock granted
after calendar year 2016, to the extent the terms of such Restricted Stock
provide for such Restricted Stock to become vested on a pro-rata basis upon
the Closing and for the remaining unvested portion of such Restricted Stock to
become automatically forfeited upon the Closing, such Restricted Stock will
not become vested by reason the preceding sentence and the portion of such
Restricted Stock automatically forfeited upon the Closing in accordance with
the terms of such Restricted Stock will be cancelled at the Effective Time for
no consideration. Promptly following the Effective Time, any cash dividends
previously paid by the Company with respect to Restricted Stock and held as of
the Effective Time by the Company or its designated agent shall be distributed
by the Company to the holder of such Restricted Stock, to the extent such
Restricted Stock has become vested at the Effective Time in accordance with
this _Section 3.3(b)_. Restricted Stock that remains unvested and subject to
restrictions at the Effective Time (after giving effect to this _Section
3.3(b)_), and any cash dividends previously paid by the Company with respect
to such Restricted Stock, shall be forfeited and the holders of such
Restricted Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto.

 



 

(c) _Other Awards_. Each award of a right under any Stock Plan (other than
awards of Company Options or Restricted Stock, the treatment of which is
specified in _Sections 3.3(a)_ and _3.3(b)_ , respectively) entitling the
holder thereof to Shares or cash equal to or based on the value of Shares (a "
_Share Unit_ ") that is outstanding or payable as of the Effective Time shall
be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time and each Share Unit
holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right
to be paid an amount in cash (without interest) equal to the product of (i)
(A) in the case of Share Units subject to performance-based vesting conditions
that have not been satisfied immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any,
the number of Shares determined as if the applicable performance goals had
been achieved at the target level of performance at the end of the applicable
performance period and (B) in the case of Share Units not or no longer subject
to performance-based vesting conditions, the total number of Shares underlying
such Share Units, and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration, less any
required withholding Taxes (the " _Share Unit Payment_ "). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, with respect to any Share Unit granted after calendar year 2016, to
the extent the terms of such Share Unit provide for such Share Unit to become
vested on a pro-rata basis upon the Closing and for the remaining unvested
portion of such Share Unit to become automatically forfeited upon the Closing,
no Share Unit Payment will be made with respect to the portion of such Share
Unit that is automatically forfeited upon the Closing in accordance with the
terms of such Share Unit. Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay
the Share Unit Payments promptly following the Effective Time. In the event
that such Share Unit Payment would cause any additional Taxes to be payable
pursuant to Section 409A of the Code with respect to a Share Unit, the payment
shall instead be made in accordance with the

 



      
 

 



 

terms of the applicable Stock Plan and related award or other governing
document and at the earliest time permitted under the terms of such Share Unit
that will not result in a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code.

 



 

(d) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the compensation committee of the board
of directors of the Company, as applicable, will adopt any resolutions and
take any actions which are necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Sections
3.3(a)_, _3.3(b)_ and _3.3(c)_ and to endorse the directors of Merger Sub as
the directors of the Surviving Corporation for purposes of any applicable
change of control provision in any Benefit Plan. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company will take all actions necessary to ensure that from and after the
Effective Time neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation will be required
to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the Company to any Person pursuant
to or in settlement of Company Options, Restricted Stock or Share Units.

 



 

(e) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. The Company shall take all actions
necessary such that (i) the then current offering period (and payroll
deductions) under the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company
ESPP_ ") shall terminate at least 30 days prior to the Effective Time, (ii)
participant accounts are applied in accordance with the Company ESPP to
purchase Shares immediately following the termination of such final offering
period (and payroll deductions), and (iii) the Company ESPP terminates
immediately prior to the Closing Date. Any Shares so purchased shall be
treated in accordance with Section 3.1(a). All amounts withheld by the
Company on behalf of the participants in the Company ESPP that have not been
used to purchase Shares prior to the termination of the Company ESPP will be
returned to the participants without interest pursuant to the terms of the
Company ESPP upon the termination of the Company ESPP.

 



 

3.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If the Company changes the number of
Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or exchange
offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger Consideration will
be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, as so adjusted, will, from
and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 



 

ARTICLE IV

 



 

 _Representations and Warranties_

 



 

Except as set forth in the Company Reports filed with the SEC since June 28,
2014, that are publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement
(excluding, in each case, any disclosures set forth in any risk factors
section, the "Forward-Looking Statements" section or any other section to the
extent they are forward-looking statements or cautionary, predictive or
forward-looking in nature of any such Company Reports) or in the corresponding
sections or subsections of the disclosure letter in agreed form delivered to
Parent by the Company contemporaneously with this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Letter_ ") (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in any
section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Letter will be deemed
disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of the Company
Disclosure

 



      
 

 



 

Letter only to the extent that the relevance of such item to such section or
subsection is reasonably apparent on its face), the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

 



 

4.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. The Company and each of
its Significant Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the Laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and has all requisite corporate or similar power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business
as presently conducted. Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, each of
the Companys Subsidiaries (other than its Significant Subsidiaries) is a
legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite
corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. The
Company and each of its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each
jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or
properties or conduct of its business requires such qualification, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date of this Agreement, the Company has
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Companys
and its Significant Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing documents, each as amended to the date of this Agreement,
and each as so delivered is in full force and effect, and the Company and such
Subsidiaries are each not in violation (other than immaterial violations) of
any of their respective provisions.

 



 

4.2 _Capital Structure_.

 



 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 400,000,000 Shares
and 30,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, $0.50 per value per share (the
" _Class B Shares_"). As of the close of business on August 12, 2016,
19,681,478 Shares were outstanding and zero Class B Shares were outstanding.
All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Other than 1,206,048 Shares reserved for
issuance under the GandK Services, Inc. Amended and Restated 1996 Directors
Stock Incentive Plan, the GandK Services, Inc. 1998 Stock Option and
Compensation Plan, as amended, and the GandK Services, Inc. Restated Equity
Incentive Plan (2013) (the " _Stock Plans_ "), the Company has no Shares
reserved for issuance. There are no outstanding awards under the GandK Services,
Inc. Amended and Restated 1996 Directors Stock Incentive Plan. After October
1, 2016, there will be no awards outstanding under the GandK Services, Inc. 1998
Stock Option and Compensation Plan. _Section 4.2(a)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter contains a correct and complete list of awards currently
outstanding under the Stock Plans, including the date of grant, number of
Shares and, where applicable, the exercise price. Each of the outstanding
shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the Companys
Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of
the Company, free and clear of all Liens. Except as set forth above or in
_Section 4.2(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, there are no preemptive or
other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights, stock
appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of capital
stock or

 



      
 

 



 

other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities
or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving
any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such
rights are authorized, issued or outstanding. Upon any issuance of any Shares
in accordance with the terms of the Stock Plans, such Shares will be duly
authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free and clear of
all Liens. The Company does not have outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes
or other obligations the holders of which have the right to vote (or
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the shareholders of the Company on any matter.

 



 

(b) _Section 4.2(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each of
the Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in each
such Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each such Subsidiary and (y) the Companys or its Subsidiaries
capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest
in any other Person. The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any
voting interest in any Person that would require an additional filing by
Parent under the HSR Act in order to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Each Company Option (i) was granted in compliance with all applicable Laws
and all of the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan pursuant to which it was
issued, (ii) has an exercise price per Share equal to or greater than the fair
market value of a Share on the date of such grant, and (iii) has a grant date
identical to the date on which the Companys board of directors or
compensation committee thereof actually awarded such Company Option.

 



 

4.3 _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_.

 



 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority and has taken
all corporate action necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger, subject only to
adoption of this Agreement (including the Plan of Merger) by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such matter at a
shareholders meeting duly called and held for such purpose (the " _Requisite
Company Vote_ "). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Company and constitutes a valid and binding Contract of the Company
enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and
similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors
rights (the " _Enforceability Exception_ ").

 



 

(b) The board of directors of the Company has unanimously (of those present)
approved this Agreement (including the Plan of Merger) and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger (such approval having been made in
accordance with the MBCA, including for purposes of Section 302A.613, Subd.1
thereof) and recommended that the Companys shareholders approve the Merger
and adopt this Agreement (including the Plan of Merger) (such recommendations,
the " _Company Recommendation_ ").

 



 

(c) The board of directors of the Company has received the opinion of its
financial advisor, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith Incorporated, to the
effect that, as of the date of such opinion, and subject to and based on the
various qualifications, assumptions,

 



      
 

 



 

limitations and matters set forth therein, the Per Share Merger Consideration
is fair from a financial point of view, as of the date of such opinion, to
such holders of Shares (other than Cancelled and Dissenting Shares), a copy of
which opinion will, promptly after the execution of this Agreement, be
delivered to Parent solely for informational purposes.

 



 

4.4 _Governmental Filings; No Violations_.

 



 

(a) No notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by the
Company with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (items (i) through
(vi), collectively, the " _Company Approvals_ ").

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result in (i) a breach or
violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company or the comparable governing documents of any of its Subsidiaries,
(ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of,
a termination (or right of termination) or default under, the creation or
acceleration of any obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the
assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pursuant to any Contract
binding upon the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or, assuming (solely with
respect to performance of this Agreement and consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby) compliance with the matters
referred to in _Section 4.4(a)(i)  (v)_, under any Law to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is subject, or (iii) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any Contract binding upon the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, except, in the case of clauses (ii) or (iii) above, as would
not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

(c) Except for (i) relationships with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
as an officer, director or employee thereof (and compensation by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries in consideration of such services) in accordance
with the terms of their employment and (ii) relationships with the Company as
shareholders or option holders therein, to the Knowledge of the Company, none

the date of this Agreement, any Contract with the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the executive officers
(as defined in Exchange Act Rule 3b-7) or directors of the Company or 5%

personal, tangible or intangible, including Intellectual Property, used in or

Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except for normal rights of a shareholder.

forms, statements, reports and documents required to be filed or furnished by
it with or to the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act since

circumstances in which they were made, not misleading. To the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company Reports is the subject of an ongoing or

responsible for the preparation of the Companys filings with the SEC and
other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal control over
financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial reporting is designed
to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial

Securities Act).

 



 

4.8 _Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Section 4.8(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete
list of (i) all material "employee benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(3)
of ERISA (whether or not subject to ERISA), (ii) all other material severance

arrangements and any trust, escrow, or similar agreement related thereto,
whether or not funded, in respect of any present or former employees,
directors, officers, shareholders, consultants, or independent contractors of
the Company and its Subsidiaries that are sponsored or maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries is required to make payments, transfers, or contributions
or has any current or future liability (all of the above being hereinafter
individually or collectively referred to as a " _Benefit Plan_ " or " _Benefit
Plans_ ," respectively).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) With respect to each material Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer
Plan), true and complete copies of the following materials have been delivered
or made available to Parent: (i) all plan documents or, in the case of an
unwritten Benefit Plan, a written description thereof, (ii) the most recent
determination letters from the IRS, (iii) all summary plan descriptions,
summaries of material modifications and annual reports, (iv) all trust
agreements, insurance contracts, participation agreements, and other documents

Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each Benefit Plan (other than
a Multiemployer Plan) has been maintained, operated, and administered in
compliance with its terms and any related documents or agreements and in
compliance with all applicable Laws. There have been no prohibited
transactions or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within
the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA with respect to the Benefit
Plans (other than Multiemployer Plans) that could result in any liability or
excise Tax under ERISA or the Code being imposed on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries that would, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(d) Each Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified and has been
determined by the IRS to be so qualified, or may rely on an opinion letter
from the IRS with respect to such qualification, and each trust created
thereunder has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from Tax under the
provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, nothing has occurred since the date of any such determination that
would reasonably be expected to give the IRS grounds to revoke such
determination.

 



 

(e) Except as set forth on _Section 4.8(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter,
neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate currently has, and at no time in
the past 6 years has had, an obligation to contribute to a "defined benefit
plan" as defined in Section 3(35) of ERISA, a pension plan subject to the
funding standards of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, a
"multiemployer plan" as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA or Section 414(f) of
the Code or a "multi-employer" pension or benefit plan as defined in the
applicable Laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States (each, a "
_Multiemployer Plan_ ") or a "multiple employer plan" within the meaning of
Section 210(a) of ERISA or Section 413(c) of the Code.

 



 

(f) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no liability under Title IV of
ERISA has been or is expected to be incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate. No "reportable event" within the meaning
of Section 4043 of ERISA (excluding any such event for which the 30-day notice
requirement has been waived under the regulations to Section 4043 of ERISA)
has occurred in the preceding six years with respect to any Benefit Plan or
will be

 



      
 

 



 

required to be filed in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. No Benefit Plan is, or is expected to be, in "at-risk" status
(within the meaning of Section 303(i)(4)(A) of ERISA or Section 430(i)(4)(A)
of the Code). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has provided, or
is required to provide, security to any "employee pension benefit plan" within
the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (each, a " _Pension Plan_ ") or to any
single-employer plan of an ERISA Affiliate pursuant to Section 436 of the
Code. Under each Pension Plan which is a single-employer plan, there has been
no material change in the financial condition, whether or not as a result of a
change in funding method, of such Pension Plan since the valuation date used
for the most recent actuarial valuation report delivered or made available to
Parent. With respect to any Multiemployer Plan contributed to by the Company,
any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate, (i) none of the Company, any
of its Subsidiaries nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any withdrawal
liability under Title IV of ERISA or the applicable Laws of a jurisdiction
outside of the United States which remains unsatisfied, and (ii) a complete
withdrawal from all such Multiemployer Plans at the Effective Time would not
result in any material liability to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole.

 



 

(g) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all contributions required to
be made under each Benefit Plan, as of the date of this Agreement, have been
timely made taking into account any applicable grace period and all
obligations in respect of each Benefit Plan have been properly accrued and
reflected to the extent required by GAAP in the most recent consolidated
balance sheet filed or incorporated by reference in the Company Reports prior
to the date of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) No Benefit Plan (other than a Multiemployer Plan) is or at any time during
the last six years was funded through a "welfare benefit fund" as defined in
Section 419(e) of the Code, and no benefits under any Benefit Plan are or at
any time have been provided through a voluntary employees beneficiary
association (within the meaning of subsection 501(c)(9) of the Code) or a
supplemental unemployment benefit plan (within the meaning of Section
501(c)(17) of the Code).

 



 

(i) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all contributions, transfers
and payments in respect of any Benefit Plan, other than transfers incident to
an incentive stock option plan within the meaning of Section 422 of the Code,
have been or are fully deductible under the Code.

 



 

(j) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened
assessment, complaint, proceeding, or investigation of any kind in any court
or government agency with respect to any Benefit Plan (other than routine
claims for benefits), nor is there any basis for one.

 



 

(k) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, all (i) insurance premiums
required to be paid with respect to, (ii) benefits, expenses, and other
amounts due and payable under, and (iii) contributions, transfers, or payments
required to be made to, any Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date will have
been paid, made or accrued on or before the Closing Date.

 



       
 

 



 

(l) With respect to any Insurance Policy providing funding for benefits under
any Benefit Plan, there is no liability of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in the nature of a retroactive rate adjustment, loss sharing
arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor would there be any
such liability if such Insurance Policy was terminated on the date hereof that
would, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

 



 

(m) Except as contemplated by this Agreement, the execution and performance of
this Agreement will not (alone or in conjunction with any other event) (i)
constitute a stated triggering event under any Benefit Plan that will result
in any payment or funding in a grantor trust or otherwise (whether of
severance pay or otherwise) becoming due from the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to any current or former officer, employee, director or
consultant (or dependents of such Persons), or (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any current
or former officer, employee, director or consultant (or dependents of such
Persons) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(n) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, be material to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, and except as permitted
pursuant to _Section 6.1_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
have agreed or committed to institute any plan, program, arrangement or
agreement for the benefit of employees or former employees of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries other than the Benefit Plans, or to make any
amendments to any of the Benefit Plans.

 



 

(o) No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual"
(as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any
employment, severance or termination agreement, other compensation arrangement
or Benefit Plan currently in effect would be characterized as an "excess
parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code). The Company has made available to Parent its estimate of any Section
280G calculations prepared (whether or not final) with respect to
"disqualified individuals" within the meaning of Section 280G(c) of the Code
in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby assuming for such
purposes that such individuals employment were terminated immediately
following the Effective Time as if the Effective Time were December 31, 2016.

 



 

(p) _Section 4.8(p)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth each
material Benefit Plan that is maintained outside of the United States (each, a
" _Non-U.S. Benefit Plan_ "). Except as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan has been established, maintained, operated,
administered, funded and invested in compliance with all applicable Law
(including applicable Law regarding the form, funding and operation of the
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan) and the terms of such Non-U.S. Benefit Plan and any
related documents or agreements in all respects. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, be material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is required to
be registered or meet similar requirements has been registered or met such
similar requirements, and has been maintained in good standing with the
applicable regulatory authorities. Except as set forth on

 



      
 

 



 

 _Section 4.8(p)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, no Non-U.S. Benefit Plan
sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries contains a
defined benefit provision as defined in subsection 147.1(1) of the Income Tax
Act (Canada). Except as set forth on _Section 4.8(p)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter, the only material obligation of the Corporation or any of
its Subsidiaries with respect to a Non-U.S. Benefit Plan that is a
Multiemployer Plan is to make the monetary contributions to such Non-U.S.
Benefit Plan in the amounts specified in the applicable collective bargaining
agreement and all such contributions have been made.

 



 

(q) No Benefit Plan provides retiree death or retiree medical benefits other
than (i) coverage mandated by Law or (ii) death or retirement benefits under
any Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code.

 



 

(r) No individual has a right to any gross-up or indemnification from the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any Taxes or penalties imposed by
Section 409A or Section 4999 of the Code.

 



 

(s) No Benefit Plan that provides for the deferral of compensation represents
amounts notionally invested in a number of Shares or otherwise provides for
distributions or benefits that are calculated based on the value of a Share.

Subsidiaries, together with adequately capitalized self-insured arrangements
(collectively, the " _Insurance Policies_ ") provide coverage in such amounts
and with respect to such risks and losses as is adequate for the respective
businesses and operations of the Companies and its Subsidiaries. Except as

ARTICLE V

 



 

 _Representations and Warranties of Parent and Merger Sub_

 



 

Except as set forth in the corresponding sections or subsections of the
disclosure letter in agreed form delivered to the Company by Parent
contemporaneously with this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (it
being agreed that disclosure of any item in any section or subsection of the
Parent Disclosure Letter will be deemed disclosure with respect to any other
section or subsection of the Parent Disclosure Letter only to the extent that
the relevance of such item to such section or subsection is reasonably
apparent on its face), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby represent and warrant
to the Company that:

 



 

5.1 _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and Merger
Sub is a legal entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing
under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization and has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub is qualified to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation or other legal entity in each jurisdiction
where the ownership, leasing or operation of its assets or properties or
conduct of its business requires such qualification, except where the failure
to be so organized, qualified or in such good standing, or to have such power
or authority, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Prior to the date of this
Agreement, Parent has made available to the Company a complete and correct
copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or comparable governing
documents of Parent and Merger Sub, each as amended to the date of this
Agreement and each as so delivered is in full force and effect and Parent and

 



      
 

 



 

Merger Sub are each not in violation (other than immaterial violations) of any
of their respective provisions.

 



 

5.2 _Corporate Authority_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite
corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in
order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and
to consummate the Merger. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered
by each of Parent and Merger Sub and is a valid and binding Contract of,
Parent and Merger Sub, enforceable against each of Parent and Merger Sub in
accordance with its terms, subject to the Enforceability Exception.

 



 

5.3 _Governmental Filings; No Violations; Etc_.

 



 

(a) No notices, reports or other filings are required to be made by Parent or
Merger Sub with, nor are any consents, registrations, approvals, permits or
authorizations required to be obtained by Parent or Merger Sub from, any
Governmental Entity in connection with the execution, delivery and performance
of this Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent and
Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, other
than (i) the filing of the Articles of Merger; (ii) compliance with the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act; (iii) compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Competition Act; and (iv) notices, reports, filings,
consents, registrations, approvals, permits or authorizations that the failure
to obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect (items (i) through (iv), collectively, the " _Parent Approvals_ ").

 



 

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and
Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute or result
in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or Merger Sub, (ii) with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the creation or acceleration of any
obligations under or the creation of a Lien on any of the assets of Parent or
Merger Sub pursuant to, any Contracts binding upon Parent or Merger Sub or,
assuming (solely with respect to performance of this Agreement and
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby)
compliance with the matters referred to in _Section 5.3(a)_, under any Law to
which Parent or Merger Sub is subject; or (iii) any change in the rights or
obligations of any party under any of such Contracts, except, in the case of
clauses (ii) or (iii) above, as would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.4 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no Actions
pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, threatened against Parent or Merger
Sub that seek to enjoin, or would reasonably be expected to have the effect of
preventing or making illegal, any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 



 

5.5 _Capitalization of Merger Sub_. The authorized capital stock of Merger Sub
consists solely of 1,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
all of which are validly issued and outstanding. All of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of Merger Sub has been at all times, including at
the Effective Time, owned by Parent or a direct or indirect

 



      
 

 



 

wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub has not conducted any business
activities of any type or kind whatsoever or entered into any agreements or
arrangements with any Person prior to the date of this Agreement and has no,
and prior to the Effective Time will have no, assets, liabilities or
obligations of any nature other than those incident to its formation and
pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

5.6 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Parent has delivered to the Company a true, accurate and complete copy of
the fully executed debt commitment letter, dated as of August 15, 2016
(together with all annexes, schedules and exhibits thereto) from the banks
named therein to Parent (collectively, the " _Debt Financing Commitment
Letter_ "), pursuant to the terms, but subject to the conditions, of which the
lender parties thereto have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub with
debt financing in the amounts set forth therein for purposes of, among other
things, financing the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, paying related fees and expenses (such debt financing, as it may be
modified (to the extent permitted by this Agreement), the " _Debt Financing_
"). The Debt Financing Commitment Letter has not been amended, modified or
waived in any manner prior to the date of this Agreement and, as of the date
of this Agreement, no such amendment, modification or waiver is pending or
contemplated. As of the date of this Agreement, neither Parent nor its
Subsidiaries has entered into any side letter or other agreement relating to
the funding of the Debt Financing, other than as set forth in the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter and the fee letters related thereto and there are
no arrangements related to the Debt Financing that would be reasonably be
expected to affect the availability of the Debt Financing. The proceeds of the
Debt Financing (both before and after giving effect to the exercise of any or
all "market flex" provisions related thereto), together with cash on hand and
each long-term debt financing that replaces all or a portion of the Debt
Financing (each such debt financing, each of which shall have conditions to
the availability and funding of the proceeds thereof that are no more
restrictive, taken as a whole, than the Financing Conditions (as defined
below), a " _Replacement Financing_ ", and collectively, the " _Replacement
Financings_ "), will be sufficient for the payment of the Merger Amount when
due on the Closing. As of the date of this Agreement, the commitments
contained in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect. As of the date of this Agreement, the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and represents a
valid, binding and enforceable obligation of Parent and, to the Knowledge of
Parent, each other party thereto, to provide the financing contemplated
thereby subject only to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions precedent
set forth in Section 1 of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter (the "
_Financing Conditions_ ") and subject to the Enforceability Exception. Parent
has fully paid (or caused to be paid) any and all commitment fees and other
amounts that are due and payable on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Debt Financing. As of the date of this Agreement, no event
has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
constitute a breach or default on the part of Parent, or to the Knowledge of
Parent, any other party thereto, under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter,
which breach or default would reasonably be expected to result in the
inability of Parent to satisfy (or materially delay the ability of Parent to
satisfy) any of the Financing Conditions on or prior to the Closing Date. As
of the date of this Agreement, Parent has no reason to believe that it or any
other party thereto will be unable to satisfy the Financing Conditions at or
prior to the

 



      
 

 



 

time contemplated hereunder for the Closing. Parent understands and
acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement, Parents obligation
thereunder is not in any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to Parents
consummation of any financing arrangements, Parents obtaining of any
financing or the availability, grant, provision or extension of any financing
to Parent.

 



 

(b) The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the Debt Commitment
Letter, together with cash on hand and the proceeds of the Replacement
Financings, if any, will provide Parent with financing on the Closing Date
that is sufficient for (i) the payment of the aggregate consideration payable
by Parent on the Closing Date pursuant to _Article III_ hereof and (ii) the
payment of all costs, fees and expenses required to be borne by Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with this Agreement on the Closing Date.

 



 

5.7 _Ownership of Company Common Stock_. Neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries is, or has been at any time during the period commencing four
years prior to the date hereof (i) an "interested shareholder" of the Company,
as such term is defined in Section 302A.673 of the MBCA or (ii) a "Related
Person" as such term is defined in the Companys articles of incorporation.

 



 

5.8 _No Other Representations_. Except for the representations and warranties
contained in _Article IV_, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees and
acknowledges that neither the Company nor any Person on behalf of the Company
makes any other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or with respect to any other
information provided or made available to Parent or Merger Sub in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including information
conveyed at management presentations, in virtual data rooms or in due
diligence sessions and, without limiting the foregoing, including any
estimates, projections, predictions or other forward-looking information.

similar provisions in any agreement to which it is a party to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent necessary to permit a person to make, on a confidential basis to the
board of directors of the Company, an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

Without limiting the foregoing, the parties agree that any breach of the
foregoing by the Representatives of the Company or its Subsidiaries, in each
case, acting by or on behalf of the Company, shall be deemed to be a breach of
this _Section 6.2_ by the Company.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, prior to the
time, but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if the Company
receives a written Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of
this _Section 6.2_ and which the board of directors of the Company determines
in good faith to be bona fide, the Company and its Representatives may (A)
provide information to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal, but only
if the Company receives from the Person so requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other
party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (excluding any
standstill provision), in which case any standstill provision applicable to
Parent and Merger Sub shall become of no further force or effect, and, to the
extent such information has not been previously made available to Parent,
promptly makes available to Parent any information the Company discloses to
such Person or its Representatives; (B) engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with such Person and its Representatives; and (C)
after having complied with _Section 6.2(c)_, approve, recommend, or otherwise
declare advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable
(publicly or otherwise) such Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent
that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith after
consultation with outside legal counsel that failure to take such action, in
light of the Acquisition Proposal and the terms of this Agreement, would be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law, (y) in each such case referred to in clause (A) or (B) above, the board
of directors of the Company has determined in good faith based on the
information then available and after consultation with outside legal counsel
and financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal,
and (z) in the case referred to in clause (C) above, the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith after consultation with outside legal
counsel and financial advisor that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior
Proposal.

 



 

(c) _No Change of Recommendation_. Except as expressly permitted by this
_Section 6.2_, neither the board of directors of the Company nor any
committee thereof shall, directly or indirectly, (i) (A) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or publicly propose or announce its intention to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in each case in any manner
adverse to Parent, the Company Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend to the
shareholders of the Company, or publicly propose or announce its intention to
approve or recommend to the shareholders of the Company, an Acquisition
Proposal or (C) following the public announcement of an Acquisition Proposal,
fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation within ten Business Days
(or if the Shareholders Meeting is to occur prior to the tenth Business Day,
such period ending on the Business Day prior to the Shareholders Meeting)
after Parent so requests in writing; _provided_ , that such reaffirmation may
indicate, if applicable and in addition to the reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation, that the board of directors of the Company continues to
evaluate such Acquisition Proposal in a manner

 



      
 

 



 

consistent with the terms of this Agreement; _provided_ , _further_ , that
Parent shall only be entitled to make one such request with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal and one request with respect to each material amendment,
modification or change thereto (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Change of Recommendation_ "); or (ii) authorize, cause or
permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding, acquisition agreement, merger agreement,
joint venture agreement or other similar agreement with respect to, or that is
intended or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with
_Section 6.2(b)_). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement, at any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time,
but not after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of directors
of the Company may make a Change of Recommendation if (1) such action is taken
in response to an Intervening Event and (2) prior to taking such action, the
board of directors of the Company has determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making such Change of
Recommendation, (x) the Company has given Parent at least four Business Days
prior written notice of its intention to take such action, and has provided a
description of the Intervening Event, and (y) upon the end of such notice
period, the board of directors of the Company shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent (to the extent Parent proposes any revisions to the Company), and shall
have determined, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that the failure to make a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the Companys directors fiduciary duties under applicable
Law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time after the date of this Agreement and prior to the time, but not
after, the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, the board of directors of the
Company may, in response to any Acquisition Proposal that was not the result
of a breach of this _Section 6.2_, make a Change of Recommendation and/or
take the actions specified in _Section 8.3(a)_ if the board of directors of
the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor, that such Acquisition Proposal is a
Superior Proposal and failure to take such action would be inconsistent with
the Companys directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company will not make a Change of Recommendation and/or
take any action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior
Proposal unless: (x) the Company notifies Parent in writing, four Business
Days in advance, that it intends to take action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_
with respect to a Superior Proposal, which notice will specify the identity of
the party who made such Superior Proposal and the material terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal and attach the most current version of
the agreement reflecting such terms and conditions; and (y) after providing
such notice and prior to making a Change of Recommendation and/or taking any
action pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ with respect to a Superior Proposal, the
Company will negotiate in good faith with Parent during such four Business Day
period (to the extent that Parent indicates to the Company that Parent desires
to negotiate) with respect to, and will consider in good faith, any changes to
this Agreement agreed to be made in writing by Parent so that such Superior
Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , that in the
event that the financial or material terms of such Acquisition Proposal is
thereafter modified by the party making such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
will provide written notice of such modified Acquisition Proposal and will
again comply with this _Section 6.2(c)_, except that the deadline for such
new written notice

 



       
 

 



 

will be reduced to three Business Days (rather than the four Business Days
otherwise contemplated by this _Section 6.2(c)_.

 



 

(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement will
be deemed to prohibit the Company from complying with its disclosure
obligations under applicable U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an
Acquisition Proposal; provided, however, that nothing in this _Section 6.2_
shall permit the Company to effect a Change of Recommendation (including
compliance with its disclosure obligations under applicable U.S. federal or
state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal) without complying with
_Section 6.2(c)_ and, for the avoidance of doubt, any such disclosure that
does not reaffirm the Company Recommendation (other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication by the board of directors of the Company to the
Companys shareholders pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act) shall be
deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent will have the right to
terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section 8.4(a)_.

 



 

(e) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company also agrees that as soon as reasonably
practicable it will request each Person that has within the twelve months
prior to the date hereof executed a confidentiality agreement in connection
with such Persons consideration of an acquisition of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to return or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Representatives.

 



 

(f) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 48 hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal are received by, any non-public information with respect
to an Acquisition Proposal is requested from, or any discussions or
negotiations with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the identity of the Person making the proposal or
offer and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers
(including, if applicable, copies of any written requests, proposals or
offers, including proposed Contracts) and thereafter will keep Parent promptly
informed of the status of any such discussions or negotiations. In the event
that any party modifies the financial or other material terms of its
Acquisition Proposal, the Company will notify Parent orally and in writing
within 48 hours of receipt of such modification of the fact that such
Acquisition Proposal has been modified and the terms of such modification
(including, if applicable, copies of any written documentation reflecting such
modification). The Company agrees that it and its Subsidiaries will not enter
any confidentiality (or similar) agreement subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that prohibits the Company from providing to Parent such material
terms and conditions. The Company will promptly (and in any event within 48
hours thereafter) notify Parent of the identity of any Person with which the
Company enters into such a confidentiality (or similar) agreement.

 



 

6.3 _Proxy Filing; Information Supplied_. The Company will prepare and file
with the SEC, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and
in any event, within 30 calendar days after the date of this Agreement, a
Proxy Statement in preliminary form relating to the Shareholders Meeting. As
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, and, in

 



      
 

 



 

any event, within 20 calendar days of this Agreement, the Company will prepare
and provide to Parent a reasonably complete draft of the preliminary Proxy
Statement. The Company agrees, as to it and its Subsidiaries, that at the date
of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the Shareholders
Meeting (a) the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the
applicable provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and (b) none of the information supplied by it or any of its
Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Parent agrees, as to it and its Affiliates, that at
the date of mailing to shareholders of the Company and at the time of the
Shareholders Meeting, none of the information supplied by it or any of its
Affiliates for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement
will contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. The Company will promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all
comments of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by
the SEC for any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information
and will promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the
Company and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the
Proxy Statement. The Company and Parent will each use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments
received on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company will cause the
definitive Proxy Statement to be mailed (i) if the SEC provides comments to
the preliminary Proxy Statement, promptly after the date the SEC staff advises
that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may commence
mailing the Proxy Statement or (ii) if, within 10 calendar days after the
filing of the preliminary Proxy Statement, the Company has not received
comments to the Preliminary Proxy Statement, promptly after such 10th calendar
day.

 



 

6.4 _Shareholders Meeting_. The Company will take, in accordance with
applicable Law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws, all action
necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the " _Shareholders
Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable (and in any event no more than 30
Business Days) after the date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to consider
and vote upon the adoption of this Agreement. Subject to _Section 6.2(b) and
6.2(c)_, the board of directors of the Company will recommend such adoption
and will take all lawful action to solicit the Requisite Company Vote at the
Shareholders Meeting. The Company will keep Parent reasonably informed
regarding the solicitation efforts and proxy tallies following the mailing of
the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company may only postpone or adjourn the Shareholders Meeting
(i) to solicit additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining the Requisite
Company Vote, (ii) for the absence of a quorum, (iii) to allow reasonable
additional time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended
disclosure that the Company has determined based on advice of outside legal
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated to the Companys shareholders within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Shareholders Meeting, (iv) if,
based on advice of outside counsel, the Company determines that the failure to
postpone or adjourn would reasonably be expected to be a violation of any
applicable Order or Law, or (v) with the written consent of Parent, which may
be withheld in its sole discretion. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, but subject to _Section 6.2(c)_, the Companys obligations
pursuant to the first sentence of this _Section 6.4_ will not be affected

 



      
 

 



 

by (i) the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication
to the Company of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) the board of directors of
the Company making a Change of Recommendation.

 



 

6.5 _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
6.5(d)_), prior to the Closing, Parent and the Company shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, all reasonable things
necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and
make effective the Merger as promptly as practicable, including (i) the
preparation and filing of all forms, registrations and notifications required
to be filed to consummate the Merger, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to
satisfy the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) using reasonable best
efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other in obtaining) any consent,
authorization, expiration or termination of a waiting period, permit, Order or
approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required under the HSR Act and the Competition Act, to the extent necessary,
proper or advisable) required to be obtained or made by Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the
Merger or the taking of any action contemplated by this Agreement, (iv)
defending any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or
administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger,
(v) using reasonable best efforts to obtain (and to cooperate with each other
in obtaining) any consent, approval of, waiver or any exemption by, any non-
governmental third party, in each case, to the extent necessary, proper or
advisable in connection with the Merger, and (vi) the execution and delivery
of any reasonable additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger
and to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, authorizations, Orders or
approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity undertaken
pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 6.5_. In that regard, prior to
the Closing, each party to this Agreement shall promptly (i) consult with the
other parties to this Agreement with respect to and provide any necessary
information and assistance as the other parties may reasonably request with
respect to (and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other parties (or
their counsel) with copies of) all notices, submissions or filings made by or
on behalf of such party with any Governmental Entity or any other information
supplied by or on behalf of such party to, or correspondence with, a
Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger, and (ii)
inform the other parties to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the
other parties with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise
the other parties orally of) any communication from or to any Governmental
Entity regarding the Merger, and permit the other parties the opportunity to
review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the
other parties in connection with, any proposed communication or submission
with any such Governmental Entity to the extent practicable; _provided_ ,
however, that Parent shall have the principal responsibility for devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary antitrust consents or
approvals. No party shall participate in any substantive meeting with any

 



      
 

 



 

Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement and the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by
such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate therein or thereat. Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to
the Confidentiality Agreement and the Joint Defense Agreement between Parent,
the Company and their respective counsel dated July 19, 2016, Parent and the
Company may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably designate any
competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this _Section
6.5(b)_ as "Outside Counsel Only Material." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside counsel of the recipient
and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees, officers or
directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in advance
from the source of the materials (Parent or the Company, as the case may be)
or its legal counsel. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this _Section 6.5_, materials provided pursuant to this _Section 6.5_ may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company and
the Merger, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and
(iii) as necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns.

 



 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to make or file
with the appropriate Governmental Entity all filings, forms, registrations and
notifications required to be filed to consummate the Merger under any
applicable Antitrust Law, and subsequent to such filings and subject to the
terms and conditions of _Section 6.5(b)_, the Company and Parent will,
respond to inquiries from Governmental Entities, or provide any supplemental
information that may be requested by Governmental Entities, in connection with
filings made with such Governmental Entities. The Company and Parent shall
file their notification and report forms under the HSR Act no later than ten
Business Days after the date of this Agreement or when advisable (but in no
event later than 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement). The
Company and Parent shall file with the Canadian Commissioner of Competition ("
_Competition Commissioner_ ") a notification pursuant to subsection 114(1) of
the Competition Act no later than ten Business Days after the date of this
Agreement or when advisable (but in no event later than 20 Business Days after
the date of this Agreement), and the Parent shall, within such time, make a
submission to the Competition Commissioner in support of a request for an
advance ruling certificate or, if the Competition Commissioner is not prepared
to issue an advance ruling certificate, a no-action letter. Subject to
_Section 6.5(b)_ and the last sentence of this _Section 6.5(c)_, in the
event that the parties receive a request for information or documentary
material pursuant to any Antitrust Law, including the HSR Act and/or
Competition Act (a " _Second Request_ "), the parties will use their
respective reasonable best efforts to submit an appropriate response to, and
to certify compliance with, such Second Request as promptly as practicable,
and counsel for both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any
such Second Request review process; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall
Parent or the Company delay certification of compliance with any such Second
Request beyond such date that is six months after the date hereof, except
pursuant to a timing, settlement or similar agreement that is otherwise in
accordance with the provisions of this _Section 6.5(c)_. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, neither Parent nor the Company, without the
other partys prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) shall (i) enter into any timing, settlement or similar
agreement, or otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would have
the effect of extending, suspending, lengthening or otherwise tolling, beyond
the date that is six months after the date hereof, the expiration or
termination of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act
or, (ii) enter into any timing or similar agreement, or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise agree or commit to any arrangement, that would bind or commit the
parties not to complete the Merger (or that would otherwise prevent or
prohibit the parties from completing the Merger) prior to any date that is
after the date that is six months from the date hereof.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and the Company shall, if required to permit the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and _Section 7.1(c)_ as promptly as
practicable, but subject to the last sentence of this _Section 6.5(d)_), (i)
propose, negotiate, commit to, effect and agree to, by consent decree, hold
separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license, holding
separate, and other disposition of the businesses, assets, properties,
products, product lines, and equity interests of Parent, the Company, and
their respective Subsidiaries and take such action or actions that would in
the aggregate have a similar effect, (ii) create, terminate, or divest
relationships, ventures, contractual rights or obligations of Parent, the
Company or their respective Subsidiaries, and (iii) otherwise take or commit
to take any action that would limit Parents freedom of action with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses,
assets, equity interests, products, product lines or properties of the Parent
or Company (including any of their respective Subsidiaries); _provided_ , that
any such sales, divestitures, licenses, holdings, dispositions, restrictions,
changes or similar effects are conditioned upon and become effective only from
and after the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained
in this Agreement shall require Parent or the Company to take, or cause to be
taken, or commit to take, or commit to cause to be taken, any divestiture,
license, hold separate, sale or other disposition (A) that would constitute a
Triggering Divestiture or (B) of, or with respect to, Parents "CINTAS"
trademark or trade name.

 



 

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this _Section 6.5_, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , that Parent shall bear all
costs and expenses associated with contesting or resisting any such action or
proceeding.

 



 

6.6 _Information; Status_. The Company and Parent each will, upon request by
the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself, its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and shareholders and such other matters as
may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection with the Proxy
Statement or any other statement, filing, notice or application made by or on
behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries to any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable Law and except as
required by any Governmental Entity or any legally binding obligation to a
third party, the Company and Parent each will keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to completion of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with
copies of notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company,
as the case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity to the extent related to the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company will give prompt
notice to Parent

 



      
 

 



 

of any change, fact or condition that would be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or result in any failure of any condition to Parents
obligations to effect the Merger and Parent will give prompt notice to the
Company of any change, fact or condition that would be reasonably expected to
have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or result in any failure of any
condition to the Companys obligations to effect the Merger.

 



 

6.7 _Access and Reports_. For the period beginning on the date of this
Agreement and ending on the earlier of (a) the Effective Time and (b) the
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, subject to
applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company will (and will cause its
Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and other authorized Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours, to its employees, properties,
books, Contracts and records (including, for the avoidance of doubt, such
items that are reasonably necessary, proper and appropriate to assist Parent
in its review of the draft Proxy Statement) and, during such period, the
Company will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish reasonably promptly
to Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested; _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to
this _Section 6.7_ will affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company herein; _provided_ , _further_ , that the
foregoing will not require the Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to
disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, would result in the disclosure
of any Trade Secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality if the Company used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
take any action that would give rise to a material risk of waiving any
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or other applicable privilege
applicable to such documents or information or (iii) to take any action that
would give rise to a material risk of a competitor of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries receiving information that is competitively sensitive;
_provided_ , however, that in such instances such party shall inform the other
party of the general nature of the information being withheld and, upon the
other partys request, reasonably cooperate with the other party to provide
such information, in whole or in part, in a manner that would not result in
any of the outcomes described in the foregoing clauses (i) through (iii). All
such information will be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 



 

6.8 _Financing and Financing Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
advisable or proper to obtain the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter on or prior to the Closing Date on the terms and
conditions described in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, including using
reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter and any Definitive Debt Financing Agreements and comply with
its obligations thereunder; (ii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent,
seek a waiver of) on a timely basis all conditions to the funding of the Debt
Financing (including the Financing Conditions) set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt Financing Agreements, in each case,
within the control of Parent and required to be satisfied by it; (iii)
negotiate and enter into definitive debt financing agreements on a timely
basis on the terms and subject to the conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment Letter (including, if necessary, any "flex" provisions)
(the " _Definitive Debt Financing Agreements_ "); and (iv) if the Debt
Financing is

 



      
 

 



 

necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ and the Financing
Conditions have been satisfied or, upon funding would be satisfied, enforce
all of its rights under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter of the Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements and cause the Financing Source Parties to fund the
full amount of the Debt Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt
written notice (i) of, to the Knowledge of Parent, any breach or default (or
any event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
would reasonably be expected to result in breach or default) by any party to
the Debt Financing Commitment Letter, (ii) if and when, to the Knowledge of
Parent, any portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter may not be available on the Closing Date for the purposes of
consummating the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) of any
expiration or termination of the Debt Financing other than an expiration or
termination in accordance with the terms of the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter. Upon the reasonable request of the Company, Parent shall keep the
Company informed on a reasonably current basis with reasonably detailed
information about the status of its efforts to obtain the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Replacement
Financings, if any, and provide to the Company copies of all material
definitive documents related to the Debt Financing (provided, however, any fee
letter may be customarily redacted in respect of (x) fee amounts and pricing
and (y) terms of any market flex in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Financing Source Parties). If the Debt Financing is necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby, then neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall take any action that could reasonably be expected to
materially delay or prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Debt Financing.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Parent shall not, and shall not permit Merger Sub
to, agree to or permit any termination, amendment or other modification of the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt Financing Agreements if
such termination, amendment or modification (i) reduces the aggregate amount
of proceeds of the Debt Financing (including by way of increased OID or fees)
necessary to pay the Merger Amount or (ii) imposes new or additional
conditions or otherwise modifies any of the Financing Conditions or other
terms in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or
prevent the Closing or (y) make the timely funding of the Debt Financing or
satisfaction of the Financing Conditions materially less likely to occur,
other than, in each case, (A) a waiver of any closing conditions by lender(s)
or their agent or (B) to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter as of the date hereof or to reassign titles to such parties who had
executed the Debt Financing Commitment Letter as of the date hereof;
_provided_ , that Parent shall have the right to substitute other financing
for all or any portion of the Debt Financing from the same and/or alternative
Financing Source Parties as set forth (and subject to the requirements) below,
without the Companys prior written consent. Upon any such amendment,
modification or substitution (including with any Replacement Financing), the
term "Debt Financing Commitment Letter" and "Definitive Debt Financing
Agreements" shall mean the Debt Financing Commitment Letter or Definitive Debt
Financing Agreement, as applicable, as so amended or modified and shall
include the related commitment letters, engagement letters, term sheets and
other definitive agreements with respect to each Replacement Financing;
_provided_ , that in the event the commitments under the Debt Financing
Commitment Letter are reduced as a result of or in connection with any
Replacement Financing, the term "Debt Financing" shall be deemed to include
such Replacement Financing.

 



      
 

 



 

Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of any such material
amendment or other modification of the Debt Financing Commitment Letter.

 



 

(c) Parent shall have the right to substitute the proceeds of consummated
equity offerings or debt offerings or other incurrences of debt for all or any
portion of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
Letter by reducing commitments under the Debt Financing Commitment Letter;
_provided_ , that (i) to the extent any such equity or debt has a scheduled
special or mandatory redemption right, such right is not exercisable prior to
the earliest of the consummation of the Merger on the Closing Date, the
termination of this Agreement and the End Date and (ii) the conditions to the
use of such proceeds to pay the Merger Amount when due shall be no more
restrictive, taken as a whole, than the Financing Conditions.

 



 

(d) If all or any portion of the Debt Financing necessary to pay the Merger
Amount becomes unavailable, then Parent shall promptly notify the Company of
such unavailability and the reasons therefore and use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) arrange to obtain, as promptly as practicable, from the same
and/or alternative Financing Source Parties, alternative financing in an
amount sufficient to pay the Merger Amount when due containing conditions to
closing and funding that (A) are not more onerous, taken as a whole, than the
Financing Conditions and (B) would not reasonably be expected to delay or
prevent the Closing and (ii) obtain, and when obtained, promptly deliver to
the Company copies of the new financing commitment letter that provides for
such alternative financing. In the event any alternative financing is obtained
in accordance with this _Section 6.8(d)_ (" _Alternative Financing"_ ),
references in this Agreement to the Debt Financing shall also be deemed to
refer to such Alternative Financing, and if one or more commitment letters or
definitive financing agreements are entered into or proposed to be entered
into in connection with such Alternative Financing, references in this
Agreement to the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements shall also be deemed to refer to such commitment letters
and definitive financing agreements relating to such Alternative Financing,
and all obligations of Parent pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall be
applicable thereto to the same extent as Parents obligations with respect to
the Debt Financing.

 



 

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective officers, directors,
employee, attorneys, accountants and other Representatives to, use reasonable
best efforts to provide at Parents sole cost and expense all customary
cooperation reasonably requested by Parent that is necessary in connection
with arranging, obtaining and syndicating the Debt Financing and the
Replacement Financings, if any, to the extent that the participation by
members of management of the Company is reasonably necessary in connection
therewith and causing, to the extent within the Companys control, the
conditions in the Debt Financing Commitment Letter and the Definitive Debt
Financing Agreements to be satisfied, and that is customarily provided for
financings of the type contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter,
including using reasonable best efforts in (i) (A) designating one or more
members of senior management of the Company to participate in, at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice, a reasonable number of lender and investor

(ii) furnishing to Parent all Company Information (including execution of
customary authorization and management representation letters) as may be
reasonably requested by Parent to assist in the preparation of the Offering
Documents, (iii) providing information that is reasonably available or readily
obtainable regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries reasonably necessary to
assist Parent in preparing Parents pro forma financial statements to the
extent such financial statements would be required by SEC Regulation S-X for
registered offerings of securities in connection with the Debt Financing, and
designating, upon request, whether any such information is suitable to be made
available to lenders and other investors who do not wish to receive material
non-public information, (iv) designating one or more members of senior
management of the Company to participate, at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, in due diligence sessions, drafting sessions, management

confidentiality provisions), lender meetings (including one-on-one meetings)
and one or more road shows, (v) assist the Parent in obtaining any corporate
credit and family ratings, and if applicable, facility ratings from any rating
agencies, (vi) requesting the Companys independent auditors to cooperate with
Parents independent auditors, participate in customary accounting due
diligence sessions and provide customary accountants comfort letters and
consents relating to information contained in the Company Reports that is used
in any prospectus or offering document for the Debt Financing, (vii) assisting
in the preparation of, and executing and delivering at the Closing, Definitive
Debt Financing Agreements and related definitive documents, including

Companys existing lenders and/or noteholders such waivers, amendments,
supplements, consents or payoff letters which may be reasonably requested by
Parent or necessary in connection with the Debt Financing , (ix) providing at
least three Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing all documentation

fulfilling its obligations pursuant to this _Section 6.8_, (i) none of the
Company, its Subsidiaries or its or their respective officers, directors,
employees and agents or other Representatives shall be required to (w) pay any
commitment or other fee, provide any security or incur any Cost or obligation
in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time, except such
expenses for which Parent is obligated to reimburse the Company, (x) take or
permit the taking of any action that would reasonably be expected to conflict
with, result in any violation or breach of, or default (with or without lapse

applicable Law or material contracts of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, (y) pass resolutions or consents or approve or authorize the
execution of the Debt Financing or the delivery of any legal opinions, or (z)
provide any cooperation that, in the opinion of the Company, would

Subsidiaries, and (ii) Parent shall reimburse the Company for all reasonable

of its Subsidiaries in connection with fulfilling its obligations pursuant to
this _Section 6.8_ (including reasonable attorneys fees, but excluding, for
the avoidance of doubt, the costs of the preparation of any annual or
quarterly historical financial statements). Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company and its Subsidiaries (and their respective
Representatives) from and against any and all Costs suffered or incurred by
them in connection with the Debt Financing, except in the event such loss or
damage arises out of or results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct
or bad faith by the Company or its Subsidiaries in fulfilling their

contrary contained in this _Section 6.8_, the condition set forth in _Section
7.2(b)_ as it applies to the Companys obligations under this _Section 6.8_,
shall automatically be deemed satisfied, except to the extent the Company has
breached its obligations under this _Section 6.8_, Parent has provided

6.8_, the Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and its
Subsidiaries corporate logos in connection with the initial syndication or
marketing of such Debt Financing; _provided_ , that such logos are used solely

the Company or its Subsidiaries or the reputation or goodwill of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

6.9 _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company will
cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be

necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Laws and rules and
policies of Nasdaq to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of the
Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange Act
as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no more
than ten calendar days after the Closing Date.

 



 

6.10 _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding this Agreement and the
Merger will be a joint press release. Thereafter each of the Company, Parent
and Merger Sub agrees that without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), it will not issue any press releases or otherwise make a public
announcement with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including by making any filings with any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity (including Nasdaq) with respect thereto,
except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing
Contract with or rules of Nasdaq or by the request of any Governmental Entity;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in this _Section
6.10_ shall not apply to (a) any release or announcement made or proposed to
be made to the extent related to a Change of Recommendation or an Acquisition
Proposal or (b) any release or announcement that is consistent in all material
respects with previous press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made by a party hereto in accordance with this Agreement, in each case under
this clause (b) to the extent such disclosure is still accurate.

cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to provide each employee
of the Company and any Subsidiary who continues to be employed by the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof following the Effective Time
(the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with base wages or salary, bonus
opportunities and benefits substantially comparable to the wages or salary,
bonus opportunities and benefits that are provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to continue (i) the
GandK Services, Inc. Executive Severance and Change in Control Policy as in

Disclosure Letter for a period in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(b) Parent shall (i) use reasonable best efforts to cause any pre-existing
conditions or limitations, actively-at-work requirements and eligibility
waiting periods under any group health plans of Parent or its Affiliates that
the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate in to be waived with
respect to Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents to the extent
such conditions, limitations or periods were satisfied under a similar Benefit
Plan, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to give each Continuing
Employee credit for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs towards
applicable deductibles, coinsurance and annual out-of-pocket limits for
expenses incurred prior to the Effective Time for which payment has been made.
To the extent that it would not result in a duplication of benefits and to the
extent that such service was recognized under a similar Benefit Plan, Parent
shall give each Continuing Employee service credit for such Continuing
Employees employment with the Company and with any entity with respect to
which the Company provides service credit for purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting credit (but excluding benefit accrual under a defined
benefit pension plan) under each applicable Parent benefit plan, as if such
service had been performed with Parent.

Effective Time, effective immediately prior to, and contingent upon, the
Closing, the Company will adopt such resolutions and/or amendments to
terminate each Benefit Plan listed in _Section 6.11(c)_ of the Company
Disclosure Letter (each, a " _Terminated Plan_ "). Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company will provide Parent with a copy of the resolutions and/or
plan amendments (the form and substance of which will be subject to review and
approval by Parent) evidencing that each Terminated Plan has been terminated.

 



 

(d) On or before January 31, 2017, the Company shall submit to the IRS a
complete Application for Determination for Employee Benefit Plan on Form 5300,

requested by Parent prior to September 30, 2016 upon advice from counsel, the
GandK Services Thrift and Retirement Plan.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Continuing Employee or
other service provider any right to continue in the employ or service of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate of Parent. Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Affiliates may terminate the employment
or service of any Continuing Employee or other service provider at any time
for any reason whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms
of this Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, amend, or modify any Benefit
Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, or
any other benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or
sponsored by Parent, Surviving Corporation, the Company or any of their
Subsidiaries or Affiliates or (ii) without limiting any of the obligations of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation under this _Article VI_, alter or limit
the ability of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries
or Affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Benefit Plan or any other
compensation or benefit or employment plan, program, agreement or arrangement
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, nothing in this _Section 6.11_ shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any Continuing Employee or current or former service
provider of the Company or its Affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof).

 



 

6.12 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 8.5_ and except for
the filings fees associated with the Company Approvals, the Parent Approvals
and any other filings with Governmental Entities contemplated by _Section
6.5_, which fees will be divided equally between the Company and Parent,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement will be paid by the party incurring such
expense.

 



 

6.13 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless each present and former
director and officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case,
when acting in such capacity) (the " _Indemnified Persons_ "), determined as
of the Effective Time, against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection
with any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including in connection with the approval of this Agreement, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby or arising out of or pertaining to
such transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time, to the fullest extent that the Company would have been
authorized to indemnify such Indemnified Persons under its articles of
incorporation or bylaws in effect on the date of this Agreement (and Parent
will or will cause the Surviving Corporation to advance expenses as incurred
to the fullest extent authorized under applicable Law; _provided_ , that the
Indemnified Person to whom expenses are advanced provides the undertaking
required by applicable Law to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to indemnification).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) For a period of at least six (6) years from and after the Effective Time,
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall
include provisions for indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation of the Indemnified Persons on the same basis as set forth in the
certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company in effect on the date
of this Agreement. Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect
the provisions in its certificate of incorporation and bylaws providing for
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified
Persons, as applicable, with respect to the facts or circumstances occurring
at or prior to the Effective Time to the fullest extent authorized from time
to time under applicable Law, and such provisions shall not be amended except
as required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by applicable Law
that would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified Persons indemnification
rights thereunder.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation as of the Effective
Time to, obtain (and, in either case, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to keep in effect thereafter) "tail" insurance policies for the
extension of the directors and officers liability coverage of the Companys
existing directors and officers insurance policies for a claims period of at
least six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
with the same or better credit rating as the Companys insurance carriers as
of the date hereof with respect to directors and officers liability
insurance (collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with terms, conditions,
retentions and limits of liability that are comparable to the Companys
existing policies with respect to any matter existing or occurring at or prior
to the Effective Time (including in connection with the approval of this
Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby or
arising out of or pertaining to such transactions), provided that the cost
thereof does not exceed an amount equal to 300% of the annual premiums
currently paid by the Company for such insurance (which premium amount the
Company represents and warrants is as set forth in _Section 6.13_ of the
Company Disclosure Letter). If the Company and the Surviving Corporation for
any reason fail to obtain such insurance policies as of the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of the
date hereof with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability that
are comparable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing policies
as of the date hereof, or the Surviving Corporation will, and Parent will
cause the Surviving Corporation to, purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such
six-year period with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are comparable to the insureds as provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date hereof with respect to any matter existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in connection with the
approval of this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby or arising out of or pertaining to such transactions); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be
required to expend for such policies pursuant to this sentence an annual
premium amount in excess of 200% of the annual premiums currently paid by the
Company for such insurance.

 



 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of that
consolidation or merger; or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, Parent

 



      
 

 



 

shall cause proper provisions to be made prior to the consummation of any
transaction of the type described in clause "(i)" or "(ii)" so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.13_.

 



 

(e) This _Section 6.13_ is intended for the irrevocable benefit of, and to
grant third party rights to, the Indemnified Persons and shall be binding on
all successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation. Each
Indemnified Person shall be a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.13_
and entitled to enforce the covenants contained in this _Section 6.13_. If
any Indemnified Person makes any claim for indemnification or advancement of
expenses under this _Section 6.13_ that is denied by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation and a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the
Indemnified Person is entitled to such indemnification, then Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall pay such Indemnified Persons costs and expenses,
including reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with
pursuing such claim against Parent or the Surviving Corporation. The rights of
the Indemnified Persons under this _Section 6.13_ shall be in addition to any
rights that such Indemnified Person may have under the organizational
documents of the Company or under any applicable Contracts, insurance policies
or applicable Laws.

 



 

6.14 _Other Actions by the Company_.

 



 

(a) _Takeover Statutes_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Company and its board of directors will grant such approvals and take such
actions as are necessary so that the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable
on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or
minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

 



 

(b) _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company will take
such steps as may be reasonably requested by Parent to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each director or officer of
the Company who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt from Section 16(b)
of the Exchange Act pursuant to Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 



 

(c) _Director Resignations_. Except as may otherwise be agreed by Parent, the
Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and deliver to Parent
at the Closing evidence reasonably satisfactory to Parent of the resignation
effective as of the Effective Time, of those directors of the Company and any
of its Subsidiaries who are in office immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

6.15 _Shareholder Litigation_. If any shareholder litigation related to this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing,
against the Company and/or the members of the board of directors of the
Company prior to the Effective Time, the Company will (i) promptly notify
Parent and will keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the status

 



      
 

 



 

thereof and (ii) provide Parent with the opportunity to participate in the
defense or settlement of such litigation. Neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary or Representative of the Company will compromise, settle or agree
to compromise or settle any such shareholder litigation or consent to the
same, unless Parent will have consented in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

_provided_ , _however_ , that if all of the conditions to Closing set forth in
_Article VII_ shall have been satisfied or shall be then capable of being
satisfied, other than the conditions set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_ and
_Section 7.1(c)_ (but, in the case _Section 7.1(c)_, only if the applicable
Order relates to the HSR Act or any other competition, merger control,
antitrust or similar Law or regulation), the End Date may be extended by
Parent or the Company, by written notice to the other party, to a date not
later than November 15, 2017, (b) the Requisite Company Vote has not been
obtained at the Shareholders Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement of
the Shareholders Meeting taken in accordance with this Agreement or (c) any
Order permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting consummation
of the Merger shall have become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.2_ will not
be available to any party that has breached in any material respect its
obligations under this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 _Termination by the Company_. This Agreement may be terminated by the
Company and the Merger may be abandoned by written notice of the Company to
Parent:

 



 

(a) at any time prior to the time the Requisite Company Vote is obtained, if
(i) the Company is not in breach of any of the terms of _Section 6.2_ (other
than an immaterial breach), and (ii) the Company, prior to or simultaneously
with such termination, pays to Parent in immediately available funds the
Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.5_; or

 



 

(b) (i) the Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement and (ii)
there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
made by Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement, or any such representation and
warranty will have become untrue after the date of this Agreement (as if made
on such subsequent date), in each case such that _Section 7.3(a)_ or _7.3(b)_
would not be satisfied and such breach or condition is not curable or, if
curable, is not cured within the earlier of (i) 30 calendar days after written
notice thereof is given by the Company to Parent and (ii) the date that is
three Business Days prior to the End Date.

 



      
 

 



 

8.4 _Termination by Parent_. This Agreement may be terminated and the Merger
may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time by written notice of
Parent to the Company if:

 



 

(a) the board of directors of the Company (i) has made a Change of
Recommendation; (ii) following the public announcement of an Acquisition
Proposal, has failed to reaffirm the Company Recommendation after receipt of a
written request to do so from Parent in accordance with _Section 6.2_ of this
Agreement; or (iii) prior to the earlier of (A) the date prior to the date of
the Shareholders Meeting and (B) eleven Business Days after the commencement
of a tender or exchange offer for outstanding Shares that has been publicly
disclosed (other than by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent), fails to recommend
against such tender offer or exchange offer;

 



 

(b) the Company or any of its Representatives breaches any covenant contained
in _Section 6.2_ in any material respect; or

 



 

(c) (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in material breach of this
Agreement and (ii) there has been a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement made by the Company in this Agreement, or any such
representation and warranty will have become untrue after the date of this
Agreement (as if made on such subsequent date), in each case such that
_Section 7.2(a)_ or _7.2(b)_ would not be satisfied and such breach or
condition is not curable or, if curable, is not cured prior to the earlier of
(i) 30 calendar days after written notice thereof is given by Parent to the
Company and (ii) the date that is three Business Days prior to the End Date.

 



 

8.5 _Effect_ ___of_ ___Termination_ ___and_ ___Abandonment_. Except as
provided in paragraphs (a) and (b) below, in the event of termination of this
Agreement and the abandonment of the Merger pursuant to this _Article_
___VIII_ , this Agreement will become void and of no effect with no liability
to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Affiliates or
Representatives); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, that (i) no such termination will relieve any party hereto of
its obligation to pay the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee (as
applicable), the expense obligations pursuant to this _Section_ ___8.5(c)_ or
any damages to any other party hereto resulting from any deliberate and
material breach of this Agreement and (ii) the provisions set forth in this
_Section_ ___8.5_ and the second sentence of _Section_ ___9.1_ will survive
the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(a) If this Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_;

 



 

(ii) pursuant to _Section 8.4(a)_ or _Section 8.4(b)_; or

 



 

(iii) pursuant to _Section 8.2(b)_ or _Section 8.4(c)_, and (A) after the
date of this Agreement and prior to the date of the termination of this
Agreement, any Person will have made or publicly disclosed or announced an
Acquisition Proposal and (B) within 12 months after termination of this
Agreement, the Company will have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal or consummated a transaction contemplated
by an Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that, solely for purposes

 



      
 

 



 

of this clause (B), the references to "15%" in the definition of "Acquisition
Proposal" will be deemed to be references to "50.1%"),

 



 

then the Company will pay Parent, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds, an amount equal to the Termination Fee, (x) in the case of clause
(a)(i) above, prior to or on the day of such termination, (y) in the case of
clause (a)(ii) above, within two Business Days of such termination and (z) in
the case of clause (iii) above, on the earlier of the day the Company enters
into a definitive agreement with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or
consummates a transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by either Parent or the Company (i)
pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_, but only if the applicable Order relates to
the HSR Act or any other competition, merger control, antitrust or similar Law
or regulation, or (ii) pursuant to _Section 8.2(a)_ and, in the case of this
clause (ii), at the time of such termination, all of the conditions set forth
in _Section 7.1_ and _Section 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than (x)
_Section 7.1(b)_ or _Section 7.1(c)_ (but, in the case _Section 7.1(c)_,
only if the applicable Order relates to the HSR Act or any other competition,
merger control, antitrust or similar Law or regulation) and (y) conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but that are capable
of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the date of such
termination), then Parent shall pay to the Company, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to an account specified by the Company, an amount
equal to the Reverse Termination Fee; _provided_ , _however_ , that no
Reverse Termination Fee shall be payable pursuant to this _Section 8.5(b)_
in the event that the failure of the condition set forth in _Section 7.1(b)_
or _Section 7.1(c)_ (but, in the case _Section 7.1(c)_, only if the
applicable Order relates to the HSR Act or any other competition, merger
control, antitrust or similar Law or regulation) to be satisfied is a result
of the Companys breach of _Section 6.5_ (other than any immaterial breach).
The Reverse Termination Fee due under this _Section 8.5(b)_ shall be paid on
the second Business Day immediately following the date of termination of this
Agreement.

 



 

(c) The parties each acknowledge that the agreements contained in this
_Section 8.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the parties would not have
entered into this Agreement, and that any amounts payable pursuant to _Section
8.5(a)_ do not constitute a penalty but constitute payment of liquidated
damages and that each of the respective liquidated damages amounts is
reasonable in light of the substantial but indeterminate harm anticipated to
be caused by the other partys breach or default under this Agreement, the
difficulty of proof of loss of damages, the inconvenience and non-feasibility
of otherwise obtaining an adequate remedy, and the value of the transactions
to be consummated thereunder. If either party fails to pay when due any amount
payable pursuant to _Section 8.5(a)_ or _Section 8.5(b)_, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub commences a suit that
results in a judgment against the Company or Parent (as applicable) for the
fee set forth in _Section 8.5(a)_ or _Section 8.5(b)_ (as applicable) or any
portion of such fee, the Company or Parent shall pay to Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company (as applicable) its costs and expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with
interest on the amount of the fee at the prime rate as published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made through the
date of payment.

and Merger Sub contained in _Article III_ and _Sections 6.12_ (Expenses) and
_6.13_ (Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance) will, to the
extent they contemplate performance after the Effective Time, survive the
consummation of the Merger. This _Article IX_ and the agreements of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in _Section 6.12_ (Expenses) and
_Section 8.5_ (Effect of Termination and Abandonment) and the Confidentiality
Agreement will survive the termination of this Agreement. All other
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement will
not survive the consummation of the Merger or the termination of this
Agreement and will terminate at the Effective Time.

 



 

9.2 _Modification or Amendment_. Subject to applicable Law, at any time prior
to the Effective Time, the parties hereto may modify or amend this Agreement,
by written agreement executed and delivered by duly authorized officers of the
respective parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, _Section 8.5_ (Effect of
Termination and Abandonment), this _Section 9.2_, _Section 9.5_ (GOVERNING
LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE), _Section 9.7_
(Entire Agreement), _Section 9.8_ (No Third Party Beneficiaries), _Section
9.10_ (Severability) and _Section 9.13_ (Liability of Financing Source
Parties) may not be amended in a manner adverse to the Financing Source
Parties without the written consent of the Financing Source Parties.

 



 

9.3 _Waiver of Conditions_. The conditions to each of the parties obligations
to consummate the Merger are for the sole benefit of such party and may be
waived in writing by such party in whole or in part to the extent permitted by
applicable Laws.

 



 

9.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each such counterpart being deemed to be an original instrument,
and all such counterparts will together constitute the same agreement.

 



 

9.5 _GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE_.

 



 

(a) THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE DEEMED TO BE MADE IN AND IN ALL RESPECTS WILL BE
INTERPRETED, CONSTRUED AND GOVERNED BY AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW OF THE
STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF TO
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER JURISDICTION.
NOTWITHSTANDING THE FOREGOING, THE MATTERS CONTAINED IN ARTICLE I, ARTICLE II
AND ARTICLE III SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE MBCA, INCLUDING MATTERS RELATING TO
THE FILING OF THE ARTICLES OF MERGER AND THE EFFECTS OF THE MERGER, AND ALL
MATTERS RELATING TO THE FIDUCIARY DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE
COMPANY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE
STATE OF MINNESOTA WITHOUT REGARD TO THE CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES

 



      
 

 



 

THEREOF TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH PRINCIPLES WOULD DIRECT A MATTER TO ANOTHER
JURISDICTION. The parties hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive personal
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or, to the extent such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County,
located in the Borough of Manhattan (the " _Chosen Courts_ ") solely in
respect of the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of this
Agreement and of the documents referred to in this Agreement, and in respect
of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and hereby
waive, and agree not to assert, as a defense in any Action for the
interpretation or enforcement hereof or of any such document, that it is not
subject thereto or that such Action may not be brought or is not maintainable
in the Chosen Courts or that the Chosen Courts are an inconvenient forum or
that the venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or any
such document may not be enforced in or by the Chosen Courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims relating to such Action or
transactions will be heard and determined in the Chosen Courts.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Section 9.5_ and without limiting the
provisions of _Section 9.13_, the Company (i) agrees that it will not, and
will not permit its Affiliates to, bring or support any Action, cause of
action, claim, crossclaim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in Law or in equity and whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against the Financing Source Parties in any way related to this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including any dispute
arising out of or relating to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof)
in any forum other than the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York or the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York
County, located in the Borough of Manhattan or, in either case, any appellate
court thereof, (ii) agrees that any such Action will be governed by the laws
of the State of New York, (iii) agrees to waive and hereby waives, irrevocably
and unconditionally, any right to a trial by jury in any such Action and (iv)
agrees to waive and hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection which such party may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of, any such
Action in any such court.

 



 

(b) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
MERGER OR THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY
WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER,
(ii) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS
WAIVER, (iii) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY
HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE
MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9.5_.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of the Chosen Courts, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which such party is entitled at Law or in equity. Furthermore, except to the
extent of any damages finally adjudicated to result from a deliberate and
material breach of this Agreement by any other party hereto, under no
circumstances (A) will the Company be entitled to monetary damages in excess
of the Reverse Termination Fee, and (B) will Parent be entitled to monetary
damages in excess of the Termination Fee. Subject to the foregoing, each of
the parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief permitted by this Agreement on
the basis that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at Law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
Law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this Agreement will not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection with any such
order or injunction.

Company Disclosure Letter, and the Confidentiality Agreement, dated June 20,
2016, between Parent and the Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ")
constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior agreements,
understandings, representations and warranties both written and oral, among
the parties, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 



 

9.8 _No Third Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Section 6.13_
(Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance), Parent and the Company
hereby agree that

 



      
 

 



 

their respective representations, warranties and covenants set forth herein
are solely for the benefit of the other party hereto, in accordance with and
subject to the terms of this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to,
and does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder, including, the right to rely upon the representations
and warranties set forth herein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the provisions
of _Section 8.5_ (Effect of Termination and Abandonment), _Section 9.2_
(Modification or Amendment), _Section 9.5_ (GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE; WAIVER
OF JURY TRIAL; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE), _Section 9.7_ (Entire Agreement), this
_Section 9.8_ and _Section 9.10_ (Severability) and _Section 9.13_
(Liability of Financing Source Parties) will inure to the benefit of the
Financing Source Parties. The parties hereto further agree that the rights of
third party beneficiaries under _Section 6.13_ will not arise unless and
until the Effective Time occurs. The representations and warranties in this
Agreement are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for
the sole benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in
accordance with _Section 9.3_ without notice or liability to any other
Person. In some instances, the representations and warranties in this
Agreement may represent an allocation among the parties hereto of risks
associated with particular matters regardless of the knowledge of any of the
parties hereto. Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not
rely upon the representations and warranties in this Agreement as
characterizations of actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this
Agreement or as of any other date.

 



 

9.9 _Obligations of Parent and of the Company_. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement will be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary
of the Company to take any action, such requirement will be deemed to include
an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 



 

9.10 _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable
and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not affect the
validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any provision of
this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may be
valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or unenforceable
provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be affected by such
invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or unenforceability
affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or the application of
such provision, in any other jurisdiction.

 



 

9.11 _Interpretation; Construction_. The table of contents and headings herein
are for convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this
Agreement and will not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the
provisions hereof. Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section or
Exhibit, such reference will be to a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement
unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." All pronouns and all variations thereof will
be deemed to refer to the masculine, feminine or neuter,

 



      
 

 



 

singular or plural, as the identity of the Person may require. The defined
terms contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular, as well as
to the plural, forms of such terms. Where a reference in this Agreement is
made to any Contract (including this Agreement), statute or regulation, such
references are to, except as context may otherwise require, the statute or
regulation as amended, modified, supplemented, restated or replaced from time
to time (in the case of a Contract, to the extent permitted by the terms
thereof); and to any section of any statute or regulation including any
successor to the section and, in the case of any statute, any rules or
regulations promulgated thereunder. All references to "dollars" or "$" in this
Agreement are to United States dollars. Each party to this Agreement has or
may have set forth information in its respective disclosure letter in a
section of such disclosure letter that corresponds to the section of this
Agreement to which it relates. The fact that any item of information is
disclosed in a disclosure schedule to this Agreement will not be construed to
mean that such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement or to
otherwise imply that any such item has had or is reasonably expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise
represents an exception or material fact, event or circumstance for the
purpose of this Agreement. Headings inserted in the sections or subsections of
a disclosure letter are for convenience of reference only and will to no
extent have the effect of amending or changing the express terms of the
sections or subsections set forth in this Agreement.

 



 

9.12 _Assignment_. This Agreement will not be assignable by operation of Law
or otherwise, except that Parent will be entitled to assign this Agreement (in
whole or in part) to any Affiliate of Parent; _provided_ , that in the case of
any such assignment by Parent, Parent will remain responsible for the
performance of the obligations hereunder by such Affiliate. Any purported
assignment in violation of this Agreement is void.

 



 

9.13 _Liability of Financing Source Parties_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, the Company agrees that it will not have any rights
or claims against any Financing Source Party (in their capacity as such) in
connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and no Financing Source Party will have any
rights or claims against the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives in connection with this Agreement, the Debt Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, in the case of both the Company
and the Financing Source Parties, whether at law or in equity, in Contract,
tort or otherwise.
