\- iii - _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of November 1, 2015 (this " _Agreement_
"), among Magnitude Parent Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (" _Parent_ "), Magnitude Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation
and an indirect Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
MedAssets, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").

_W_ _I_ _T_ _N_ _E_ _S_ _S_ _E_ _T_ _H_ :

 

WHEREAS, it is proposed that Merger Sub will be merged with and into the
Company under the Laws of Delaware (the " _Merger_ "), with the Company
surviving the Merger and becoming a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of Parent as a
result of the Merger, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State
of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ");

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company has (i) determined that it is
in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders, and declared it
advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (ii) approved the execution, delivery
and performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions, including the Merger and (iii) resolved to recommend adoption
of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company;

WHEREAS, the Board of Managers of Parent and the Board of Directors of Merger
Sub have approved this Agreement and declared it advisable for Parent and
Merger Sub, respectively, to enter into this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition
and inducement to the Companys willingness to enter into this Agreement
Pamplona Capital Partners IV, L.P. (the " _Guarantor_ ") is entering into a
limited guarantee in favor of the Company (the " _Limited Guarantee_ ") with
respect to certain obligations of Parent and Merger Sub under this Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
Transactions and also to prescribe various conditions to the Transactions.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto hereby agree as
follows:

 

ARTICLE I.

THE MERGER 

Section 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the DGCL, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease and the Company shall
be the surviving corporation in the Merger and continue as a Delaware
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") as a result of the Merger. Section 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been
terminated pursuant to the provisions of _Section 9.1_, the closing of the
Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place on the date that is the later of
(a) the second Business Day after the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable Law) of the conditions (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction
or, where permitted, waiver of those conditions as of the Closing) set forth
in _Article VIII_  and (b) the next Business Day following the final day of
the Marketing Period or such earlier Business Day during the Marketing Period
as may be specified by Parent on no less than three Business Days prior
written notice to the Company (which date set forth in such notice may be
conditioned on the contemporaneous consummation of the Financing), unless
another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto (the date
of the Closing, the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Willkie Farr and Gallagher LLP, 787 Seventh Avenue, New York, New
York 10019, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties
hereto.

 

Section 1.3. _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as
soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware a certificate of merger executed
in accordance with, and containing such information as is required by, the
relevant provisions of the DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in order to
effect the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon the filing of the
Certificate of Merger in accordance with the DGCL, or at such later time as is
agreed by the parties hereto prior to the Closing Date and specified in the
Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of
the Merger shall be as provided for in this Agreement and the DGCL. Under the
DGCL, from and after the Effective Time: (a) the Merger of the Company and
Merger Sub and their continuance as one company shall become effective; (b)
the property of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the property
of the Surviving Corporation; (c) the Surviving Corporation shall continue to
be liable for the obligations and liabilities of each of the Company and
Merger Sub; (d) any existing cause of action, claim or liability to
prosecution shall be unaffected; (e) a civil, criminal or administrative
action or proceeding pending by or against the Company or Merger Sub may be
continued to be prosecuted by or against the Surviving Corporation; and (f) a
conviction against, or ruling, order or judgment in favor of or against, the
Company or Merger Sub may be enforced by or against the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 1.5. _Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and by-
laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time to be in the form of
(except with respect to the name of the Company) the certificate of
incorporation and by-laws of Merger Sub, and as so amended shall be the
certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until
thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

 



\- 2 - Section 1.6. _Directors; Officers_.

 

(a) The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. 

(b) The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be the officers of the Surviving Corporation immediately following the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving
Corporation. 

Section 1.7. _Effect on Share Capital_. Pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Dissenting Shares or shares referred to in _Section 1.7(f)_) shall be
converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right
to receive $31.35 in cash, without interest, and the Additional Per Share
Consideration, if any (together, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). For purposes
of this Agreement, " _Additional Per Share Consideration_ " means, if
the Effective Time does not occur on or prior to January 30, 2016 (the "
_Trigger Date_ ") and the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or prior
the Trigger Date was not caused by the failure of the Company to perform in
all material respects its obligations under this Agreement, an amount
(rounded down to the nearest penny) in cash equal to the product of (i) the
number of days during the period commencing on, and including, the Trigger
Date and ending on the day immediately preceding the Closing Date and (ii)
$0.008589041 (for purposes of illustration, the Additional Per Share
Consideration for a 30 day calendar month would equal $0.25).

 

(b) _Cancellation of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all
shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares or shares
referred to in _Section 1.7(f)_) shall cease to be outstanding and shall be
automatically canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder
of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company
Common Stock, except the right to receive the applicable Merger Consideration
to be paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate
in accordance with _Section 2.2_, without interest.

(c)  _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of
capital stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior

 



\- 3 -  to the Effective Time and that are held by a stockholder who has properly
exercised and perfected its, his or her appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL (a " _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") shall not be converted into or be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ "), but instead such holder shall be entitled to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Stockholder pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (or any successor provision)
(and at the Effective Time, such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
such holder shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
rights set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL), unless and until such holder
shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost rights to appraisal under the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any
Dissenting Stockholder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost such right, such holders shares of Company Common Stock
shall thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration for each such share of Company Common Stock, in accordance with
_Section 2.2_, without any interest thereon. The Company shall give Parent
(i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of
Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating
to stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate,
at its expense, in negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands
for appraisal. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, prior to the
Effective Time the Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
make any payment or agree to make any payment with respect to any demands for
appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands for a payment.

(e) _Changes to Company Stock_. If after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, the Company should split, subdivide, consolidate, combine or
otherwise reclassify the Company Common Stock, or pay a stock dividend in
Company Common Stock, or otherwise change the Company Common Stock into any
other securities, or pay any other such stock dividend in respect of the
Company Common Stock, then any number or amount contained herein that is based
upon the price of Company Common Stock or the number of shares of Company
Common Stock, as the case may be, will be appropriately adjusted to reflect
such split, combination, dividend or other distribution or change.

(f)  _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock; Treatment of
Stock Held by Company Subsidiaries_. As of the Effective Time, (i) all shares
of Company Common Stock that are owned by the Company as treasury stock and
any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent or Merger Sub immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be automatically canceled and retired and
shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor; and (ii) all shares of Company Common Stock that are owned by any
direct or indirect Subsidiary of Parent (other than Merger Sub) or the Company
shall be converted into and become validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation (except that the number of shares of Company Common
Stock owned by any such Subsidiary may be adjusted following the Merger to
maintain relative ownership percentages).

 



\- 4 - Section 1.8. _Treatment of Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Company Options_. Each option to purchase shares of Company
Common Stock that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that
was granted pursuant to any of the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or
unvested (each, a " _Company Option_ "), shall, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time, become fully vested (to the extent not already vested) and be
cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option
multiplied by (ii) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Company Option.

 

(b) _Treatment of Company Restricted Share Awards_. Each award of Company
Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant
to any of the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time(each, a " _Company Restricted Share Award_ "), shall be subject
to this _Section 1.8(b)_. Each Company Restricted Share Award subject only
to time vesting conditions shall become fully vested immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Each Company Restricted Share Award subject to performance
vesting conditions for which the applicable performance period is not
completed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Performance Share_ ") shall vest subject to the following rules: (1) each
agreement, plan or arrangement covering Performance Shares that specifies the
level of performance at which the Performance Shares shall be earned in the
event of a change in control shall be applied and enforced; (2) with respect
to Performance Shares for which no applicable agreement, plan or arrangement
specifies the level of performance at which the Performance Shares shall be
earned in the event of a change in control, the number of Performance Shares
that vest immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be based on the target
performance; and (3) each Performance Share that does not vest in accordance
with clause (1) or clause (2) shall be cancelled and terminated without
consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Restricted
Share Award that vests in accordance with this _Section 1.8(b)_ shall be
cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time and
automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to
the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such vested Company Restricted Share Award and (ii)
the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) _Treatment of Company Restricted Share Units_. Each award of a restricted
stock unit granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a " _Company Restricted Share
Unit_ "), shall be subject to this _Section 1.8(c)_. Each Company Restricted
Share Unit subject only to time vesting conditions shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company Restricted Share Unit
subject to performance vesting conditions for which the applicable performance
period is not completed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each,
a " _Performance Unit_ ") shall vest subject to the following rules: (1) each
agreement, plan or arrangement covering Performance Units that specifies the
level of performance at which the Performance Units shall be earned in the
event of a change in control shall be applied and enforced; (2) with respect
to Performance Units for which no applicable agreement, plan or arrangement
specifies the level of performance at which the Performance Units shall be
earned in the event of a change in control, the number of Performance Units
that vest immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be

 



\- 5 -  based on the target performance; and (3) each Performance Unit that does not
vest in accordance with clause (1) or clause (2) shall be cancelled and
terminated without consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Each Company Restricted Share Unit that vests in accordance with this _Section
1.8(c)_ shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the
Effective Time and automatically converted into the right to receive an
amount in cash equal to the product obtained by multiplying (i) the total
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such vested Company
Restricted Share Unit and (ii) the Merger Consideration.

(d) _Treatment of Company SARs_. Each award of a share appreciation right
representing a right to acquire shares of Company Common Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that was granted pursuant
to any of the Company Stock Plans, whether vested or unvested (each, a "
_Company SAR_ "), shall be subject to this  _Section 1.8(d)_. Each Company
SAR subject only to time vesting conditions shall become fully vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each Company SAR subject to
performance vesting conditions for which the applicable performance period is
not completed as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each, a "
_Performance SAR_ ") shall vest subject to the following rules: (1) each
agreement, plan or arrangement covering Performance SARs that specifies
the level of performance at which the Performance SARs shall be earned in the
event of a change in control shall be applied and enforced; (2) with respect
to Performance SARs for which no applicable agreement, plan or arrangement
specifies the level of performance at which the Performance SARs shall be
earned in the event of a change in control, the number of Performance SARs
that vest immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be based on the target
performance; and (3) each Performance SAR that does not vest in accordance
with clause (1) or clause (2) shall be cancelled and terminated without
consideration immediately prior to the Effective Time. Each vested Company SAR
shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect as of the Effective Time
and automatically converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal
to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
base price per vested Company SAR multiplied by (ii) the total number of
Company SARs subject to such award.

(e) _Treatment of ESPP_.

 

(i) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall adopt resolutions and take all actions
necessary to (A) cause the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") not to (1) commence an offering period to purchase Company Common
Stock that would otherwise begin after the end of the offering period in
effect as of the date hereof or (2) accept payroll deductions to be used to
purchase Company Common Stock under the ESPP after the end of the offering
period in effect as of the date hereof, (B) provide that (1) each individual
participating in the offering period in effect as of the date hereof will not
be permitted to increase his or her payroll contribution rate pursuant to the
ESPP from the rate in effect when such offering period commenced and (2) no
individual will be allowed to commence participation in the ESPP following the
date of this Agreement and (C) cause the ESPP to terminate immediately after
the purchases set forth in _Section 1.8(e)(ii)_.

 

(ii) No later than five days prior to the Effective Time, in the case of any
outstanding purchase rights under the ESPP, (A) the offering period (if any)
under the ESPP shall end and each participants accumulated payroll deduction
shall be used to purchase newly issued Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of the ESPP and (B) such Company Common Stock shall be treated the
same as all other Company Common Stock in accordance with _Section 1.7_ of
this Agreement. The Company shall make any pro rata adjustments that may be
necessary to reflect the shortened offering period. 

 



\- 6 - (f) The Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries, as applicable, shall
pay to the holders of Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards,
Company Restricted Share Units, and Company SARs the cash amounts described in
this _Section 1.8_ less such amounts as are required to be withheld or
deducted under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Law
relating to Tax with respect to the vesting of the award or making of such
payment, on the first payroll date following the Effective Time. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders
of Company Options, Company Restricted Share Awards, Company Restricted Share
Units, and Company SARs in respect of which such deduction and withholding
was made. For each Company Option or Company SAR, if the applicable exercise
price per share of Company Common Stock or base price per Company SAR equals
or exceeds the Merger Consideration, such Company Option or Company SAR,
as applicable, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration, and
all rights with respect to such Company Option or Company SAR, as applicable,
shall terminate as of the Effective Time.

 

(g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions in its
control necessary (including adopting any required resolutions and seeking
any required holder consents) to (i) effectuate the provisions of this
_Section 1.8_ and (ii) to provide that all Company Options, Company
Restricted Share Awards, Company Restricted Share Units, Company SARs and
Company Stock Plans shall terminate as of the Effective Time and shall no
longer have any force or effect, and the provisions in any other Company
Benefit Plan or contract providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries will be cancelled as of the Effective Time and shall no longer
have any force or effect.

 

ARTICLE II.

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

Section 2.1. _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
deposit with a bank or trust company as Parent shall determine and who shall
be reasonably satisfactory to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), in trust
for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with  _Section 1.7(a)_, immediately available funds equal to the
aggregate Merger Consideration, and Parent shall instruct the Exchange Agent
to timely pay the Merger Consideration subject to and in accordance with the
terms of  _Section 2.2_ of this Agreement. Any cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."
Such aggregate cash deposited with the Exchange Agent shall, pending its
disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Exchange

 



\- 7 -  Agent as directed by Parent in (i) short-term direct obligations of the
United States of America or (ii) short-term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for
the payment of principal and interest.

Section 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time (but in no event more than three (3) Business Days thereafter),
the Exchange Agent will send to each record holder of shares of Company Common
Stock other than Dissenting Shares, (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent and shall be in a
reasonable and customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
each holder of a Certificate or Book-Entry Shares, upon surrender of a
Certificate or Book-Entry Shares to the Exchange Agent together with such
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without interest, for each share
of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, and the Certificate and Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. The Exchange Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Exchange Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with
normal exchange practices. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any
cash payable pursuant to _Section 1.7(a)_ or _Section 1.8_. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition
of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed
or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y) the Person
requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required
by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered and shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that
such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Payment of the applicable
Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Shares shall only be made to
the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Shares are registered. 

Section 2.3. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with
the terms of this _Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock
previously represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares.

Section 2.4. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares
for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the Surviving
Corporation, and any holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this _Article II_ shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation and Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to _Section 1.7_. Any amounts 

 



\- 8 -  remaining unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable abandoned property, escheat, or
other similar Laws, the property of the Surviving Corporation or its designee,
free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

 

Section 2.5. _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in
respect of any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

 

Section 2.6. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate or other documentation reasonably requested by Parent, the
Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

Section 2.7.  _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, the
Exchange Agent, Merger Sub and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as
it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ ") or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Surviving Corporation, the Exchange Agent, Merger Sub or Parent, as the case
may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be.

 

Section 2.8. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to
take and do any other actions and things in each case to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and
all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties
or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result
of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 

Section 2.9. _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business, New York time,
on the day the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company
shall be closed and there shall be no further registration of transfers of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock, except as
otherwise provided herein or by Law. On or after the Effective Time, any
Certificates presented to the Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall
be exchanged for the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of
Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.

for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time it is filed with the

or at the time of the Company Stockholders Meeting (or any adjournment or

Sub.

 

Section 4.8. _Financing_. Parent has delivered to the Company true, correct
and complete copies, as of the date of this Agreement, of (a) an executed
commitment letter (the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " from Pamplona Capital
Partners IV, L.P. to invest, subject to the terms and conditions therein, cash
in the aggregate amount set forth therein (the " _Equity Financing_ ") and
(b) an executed commitment letter (the " _Debt Commitment Letter_ ") from
Barclays Bank PLC, Morgan Stanley Senior Funding, Inc., Macquarie Capital
(USA) Inc., MIHI LLC and GCI Capital Markets LLC (each such financial
institution and its Affiliates, together with any Person and its Affiliates
that becomes a party to the Debt Commitment Letter and any joinder agreement
related thereto after the date hereof, the " _Financing Sources_ "), together
with the Equity Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ ") to provide,
subject to the terms and conditions therein, debt financing in the aggregate
amount set forth therein (the " _Debt_  

 



\- 30 -   __ _Financing_ " and, together with the Equity Financing, the " _Financing_
"). As of the date hereof, (A) neither the Equity Commitment Letter nor the
Debt Commitment Letter has been amended or modified, (B) no such amendment or
modification is contemplated (other than amendments or modifications that are
not prohibited by _Section 7.9(a)_), and (C) the respective obligations
and commitments contained in such letters have not been withdrawn or
rescinded. Parent or Merger Sub has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees in connection with the Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt
Commitment Letter that are due and payable on or prior to the date hereof.
Assuming that the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letters is fully
funded, the net proceeds contemplated by the Commitment Letters will, in the
aggregate (and when combined with the cash on hand at the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date), be sufficient for Merger Sub to pay the
aggregate Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of the Transactions and to pay all
related fees and expenses. The Commitment Letters are in full force and
effect as of the date hereof. As of the date of this Agreement to the
Knowledge of the Parent, no event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would or would reasonably be expected to cause any of
the conditions to the Financing not to be satisfied or the full amount of the
Financing not to be funded. As of the date of this Agreement, assuming that
each of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_  of the Agreement are
satisfied at Closing, Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of
the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the Financing
will not be available to Parent or Merger Sub on the date of the Closing. The
Commitment Letters contain all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the
terms therein. Except for a fee letter with respect to fees relating to the
Debt Financing (a copy of which has been provided to the Company on or prior
to the date hereof, redacted in a customary manner as to fees and market flex)
(the " _Fee Letter_ "), as of the date hereof there are no side letters or
other agreements, contracts or arrangements to which Parent or any of its
Affiliates is a party related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letters and any customary engagement letter and non-disclosure
agreements that do not impact the conditionality or amount of the Financing.

Section 4.9.  _Solvency_. Assuming (a) satisfaction of the conditions to
Parents and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the Merger, and after
giving effect to the Merger, including the Financing (as some or all of such
Financing may be amended or replaced in compliance herewith) and the payment
of the aggregate Merger Consideration, (b) any repayment or refinancing of
debt contemplated in this Agreement or the Commitment Letters, (c) the
accuracy of the representations and warranties of the Company set forth in
_Article III_ and any certificate delivered hereunder and compliance in all
material respects by the Company with the covenants and other agreements of
the Company contained herein, (d) that the Company is Solvent immediately
prior to the Effective Time before giving effect to the Transactions, (e)
payments of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the
consummation of the Merger, (f) payment of all related fees and expenses, (g)
that any estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or
business plans of the Company and its Subsidiaries that have been provided by
the Company to Parent prior to the date hereof were prepared based
upon assumptions that were, at the time made, and continue to be, at the
Effective Time, reasonable, and (h) that the indebtedness and other
obligations under the Debt Financing incurred on the Closing Date will become
due on their respective stated maturities, each of Parent and the Company and
its Subsidiaries (on a consolidated basis) will be Solvent as of the Effective
Time

 



\- 31 -  and immediately after the consummation of the Merger. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Solvent_ " when used with respect to any Person,
means that, as of any date of determination (a) the amount of the "fair
saleable value" of the assets of such Person will, as of such date, exceed (i)
the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including contingent and other
liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally determined
in accordance with applicable Law governing determinations of the insolvency
of debtors, and (ii) the amount that will be required to pay the probable
liabilities of such Person on its existing debts (including contingent and
other liabilities) as such debts become absolute and mature, (b) such Person
will not have, as of such date, an "unreasonably small amount of capital" for
the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature.

 

Section 4.10. _Board Approval_. The Board of Directors of Parent, at a meeting
duly called and held, by unanimous vote (i) determined that this Agreement
and the Transactions, including the Merger, are advisable and fair to, and in
the best interests of, Parent, and (ii) approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Merger.

 

Section 4.11. _No Vote of Parent Stockholders_. No vote of the stockholders of
Parent or the holders of any other securities of Parent (equity or otherwise)
is required by applicable Law, the Parent Organizational Documents or the
applicable rules of any exchange on which securities of Parent are traded, in
order for Parent to consummate the Transactions.

or, to the Knowledge of Parent, investigations pending or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, threatened, against Parent or Merger Sub before any Governmental
Entity, except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material
Adverse Effect. There is no material judgment, decree, injunction, rule or
order of any Governmental Entity outstanding, or to the Knowledge of Parent,
threatened, against either Parent or Merger Sub, except as would not

Parents Knowledge, any of Parents Affiliates directly or indirectly owns,
and at all times for the past three years, neither Parent nor, to Parents

any shares of the Companys capital stock or any securities, contracts or
obligations convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of the
Companys capital stock. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub has enacted or will
enact a plan that complies with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act covering
the purchase of any of the shares of the Companys capital stock.

Section 4.14. _Acknowledgement by Parent and Merger Sub_.

Sub has relied on, any representations or warranties whatsoever regarding the

contained in this Agreement shall give to the Company, directly or
indirectly, rights to control or direct the operations of Parent or its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

 



\- 37 - Section 6.2. _Indemnification Continuation_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 6.2_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the Effective
Time, (x) an officer or director of the Company or its Subsidiaries or (y)
serving at the request of the Company as an officer or director of another
corporation, joint venture or other enterprise or general partner of any
partnership or a trustee of any trust and (ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, to provide
indemnification to each Indemnified Person to the same extent and under the
same conditions and procedures as such Indemnified Person is entitled on the
date hereof under the Company Organizational Documents (or the
corresponding organizational documents of the Companys Subsidiaries) and as
provided in employment or indemnification agreements with such Indemnified
Person as in effect on the date hereof (true and complete copies of which have
been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof and are listed on _Schedule
3.18(a)_ ) in connection with any Proceeding based directly or indirectly (in
whole or in part) on, or arising directly or indirectly (in whole or in part)
out of, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was an officer or
director of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or is or was serving at the
request of the Company as an officer or director of another corporation, joint
venture or other enterprise or general partner of any partnership or a
trustee of any trust, whether pertaining to any matter pending, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving Corporation shall
not amend, repeal or otherwise modify the exculpation, indemnification
and advancement of expenses provisions of the Company Organizational
Documents or the corresponding organizational documents of the Companys
Subsidiaries as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or in any
indemnification contracts of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any of
their respective directors, officers or employees as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, in each case in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time
were current or former directors, officers or employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries.

(c) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, and the Surviving
Corporation shall, maintain in effect for six years from the Effective Time
the Companys current directors and officers liability insurance policies
covering acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with
respect to Indemnified Persons ( _provided_ that the Surviving Corporation may
substitute therefor policies with reputable carriers of at least the same
coverage containing terms, conditions and exclusions that are not less
favorable to the Indemnified Persons); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall the Surviving Corporation be required to expend pursuant to this
_Section 6.2(c)_ more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current
annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance. In the event that, but
for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Surviving
Corporation would be required to expend more than 300% of current
annual premiums, the Surviving Corporation shall obtain the maximum amount of
such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of
current annual premiums. In lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase,
prior to the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid officers and
directors liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such Indemnified Person;
_provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company expend on such
"tail" policy more than an amount per year equal to 300% of current annual
premiums paid by the Company for such insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that
in the event, but for the immediately

 



\- 38 -  preceding proviso, the Company would be required to expend more than 300% of
current annual premiums, the Company may obtain the maximum amount of such
insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to 300% of current
annual premiums. If such "tail" policy has been established by the Company,
Parent shall not terminate such policy and shall cause all obligations
thereunder to be honored by it and the Surviving Corporation.

(d) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which
the Effective Time occurs, the Surviving Corporation (together with its
successors and assigns, the " _Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable requirements under Law, indemnify and hold
harmless each Indemnified Person in his or her capacity as an officer or
director of the Company and its Subsidiaries against all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, fees, expenses, judgments or fines incurred by such
Indemnified Person as an officer or director of the Company in
connection with any pending or threatened Proceeding based on or arising out
of, in whole or in part, the fact that such Indemnified Person is or was a
director or officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries at or prior to the
Effective Time and pertaining to any and all matters pending, existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, including any such matter arising under
any claim with respect to the Transactions. Without limiting the foregoing,
from the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the date on which the
Effective Time occurs, the Indemnifying Parties shall also, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable requirements under Law, advance reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees)
incurred by the Indemnified Persons in connection with matters for which such
Indemnified Persons are eligible to be indemnified pursuant to this  _Section
6.2(d)_ within 15 days after receipt by Parent of a written request for such
advance, subject to the execution by such Indemnified Persons of appropriate
undertakings in favor of the Indemnifying Parties to repay such
advanced costs and expenses if it is ultimately determined in a final and
nonappealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction that such
Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under this _Section
6.2(d)_.

 

(e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
Parent shall ensure that the successors and assigns of the Surviving
Corporation or, at Parents option, Parent, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this _Section 6.2_.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section 6.2_ shall survive the consummation of
the Merger for a period of six years and are (i) expressly intended to be for
the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons
and their heirs and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any
other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have
by contract or otherwise.

Section 6.3. _Notice of Breach_. From and after the date hereof and until the
earlier to occur of the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Article IX_ hereof, Parent shall promptly give notice upon having
Knowledge of the existence of any event or circumstance that would be likely
to cause any condition to the obligations of any party hereto to effect the
Transactions not to be satisfied.

Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be distributed to the Companys
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date the SEC confirms that
it has no further comments on the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments

Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
is discovered by the Company or Parent that should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement or
the other filings shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they are made, not misleading, the party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other parties thereof, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the
stockholders of the Company. Prior to the filing or distribution of the Proxy
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any SEC
comments on the Proxy Statement, each of the Company, on the one hand, and

all action necessary to call, give notice of, and hold, the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of

 



\- 40 -  obtaining the Required Company Vote. In connection with such meeting, the
Company will, subject to _Section 7.4(b)_ and _Section 7.4(c)_, use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain the Required Company Vote (including using
its reasonable best efforts to solicit proxies from the Companys
stockholders). The Company shall keep Parent updated with respect to proxy
solicitation results as reasonably requested by Parent. The information
supplied or to be supplied by the Company specifically for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement (including by incorporation by reference), shall not, on the
date(s) the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, on the date(s) the Proxy
Statement is first distributed to the stockholders of the Company or at the
time of the Company Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Company in its
sole discretion may adjourn or postpone the Company Stockholders Meeting (A)
after consultation with Parent, to the extent necessary to ensure that any
required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
stockholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time in advance of
the Company Stockholders Meeting or (B) with the consent of Parent, if as of
the time for which the Company Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled
(as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are insufficient shares of Company
Common Stock represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a
quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Company Stockholders Meeting.
The Company agrees that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with _Section 9.1_, its obligations pursuant to this  _Section
7.1_ shall not be affected by the making of any Change in Recommendation by

to the earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its

representatives and Financing Sources reasonable access during normal business
hours to the Companys officers, employees, agents, properties, books,
contracts and records and the Company shall furnish promptly to Parent
such information concerning its business, personnel, assets, liabilities and
properties as Parent may reasonably request; _provided_ that Parent and its
representatives shall conduct any such activities at its expense and in such a
manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company; _provided_ , _further_ , however, that the Company shall not be
obligated to provide such access or information if the Company determines, in
its reasonable judgment, that doing so would violate applicable Law or a
contract or obligation of confidentiality owing to a third party, jeopardize
the protection of an attorney-client privilege, or expose the Company to risk
of liability for disclosure of sensitive or personal information; _provided_
, _however_ , that the parties hereto shall attempt in good faith to make such
alternative arrangements as may be reasonably necessary so that the
restrictions in the immediately preceding proviso would not apply. Each party
hereto will hold any such information that is nonpublic in confidence to the
extent required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of that certain
agreement, dated as of September 14, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), between the Company and Pamplona Capital Management LLC, together with

enforcement authorities or competition authorities of any other nation or
other jurisdiction or any other Person may assert under any Law (other than
with respect to any stockholder litigation or claim related to
this Agreement, the Merger or the other Transactions) with respect to the
Transactions, and to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger
so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in
any event no later than the Termination Date),

 



\- 42 -  including (x) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by
consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or

ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporations) or Affiliates businesses, product lines or assets,

preventing or delaying the Closing (any such action, a " _Remedial Action_
"); _provided_ that neither Parent, the Company nor any of their respective
Subsidiaries shall become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take
any action with respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order of a Governmental Entity to sell, hold separate or
otherwise dispose of, or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise
change the assets or business of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, unless such requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order is binding on Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries only in the event that the Closing occurs. Parent and
Merger Sub shall not (and shall cause their Subsidiaries and Affiliates not
to) take or agree to take any action with respect to the Carve-Out Transaction
or any other arrangement with respect to the Carve-Out Buyer or any of its
Affiliates (individually or in conjunction with the Carve-Out Buyer or any of
its Affiliates) that would be reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay
the Closing.

 

(c) The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall cooperate and consult with each
other in connection with the making of all registrations, filings,

respects with each other and, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to contest and resist any such action or
proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents, delays or restricts
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions. Notwithstanding the
foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement, nothing in this _Section
7.3_ shall limit a partys right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ or _Section 9.1(c)_ so long as such party has, prior to
such termination, complied with its obligations under this _Section 7.3_ in
all material respects.

Subsidiaries is a beneficiary and (C) not terminate, waive, amend, release or
modify any provision of any standstill agreement (including any standstill
provision contained in any confidentiality or other agreement) to which it or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives is a party, unless, solely, with
respect to this clause (C), the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of
Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.
The Company shall promptly after the date of this Agreement instruct each
Person which has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement relating to
any Acquisition Proposal with or for the benefit of the Company to promptly

(as determined on a book-value basis) or any assets of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to which, individually or in the aggregate, 20% or more of
the Companys consolidated revenue or earnings for the most recently completed
fiscal year of the Company are attributable, in each of the foregoing cases,
other than the Merger contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the
Company, directly or indirectly through Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees, representatives, advisors or other intermediaries, may (i) take and
disclose to the Companys stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2
or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act with
regard to any Acquisition Proposal (provided, that any such action or
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change in Recommendation, unless the Board
of Directors of the Company reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation in
connection with such action or disclosure), (ii) make the disclosure
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act and (iii)

this Agreement the Company, its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective Representatives receive a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ (A) engage in or enter
into or otherwise participate in discussions and negotiations regarding
such Acquisition Proposal with the Person (and its representatives, advisors
and intermediaries) that makes such Acquisition Proposal, and (B) furnish to
such Person non-public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries
and provide access to the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers,
employees, agents, properties, books, contracts and records, in each case, in
response to a request therefor, pursuant to a confidentiality agreement with
such Person (a copy of which shall be provided to Parent) containing terms
that are not less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (except that (1) it shall not be required to

 



\- 45 -  prohibit the making of an Acquisition Proposal and (2) such confidentiality
agreement may include terms that are less favorable to the Company than those
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement so long as the Company offers to
amend the Confidentiality Agreement substantially concurrently with the
execution of such confidentiality agreement to include such terms for the
benefit of Pamplona Capital Management LLC) and to the extent nonpublic
information that has not been made available to Parent is made available to
such Person, furnish such nonpublic information to Parent prior to or
substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; 
_provided_ that the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives shall be permitted to take an action described in the
foregoing clause (ii) if, and only if, prior to taking such particular action,
the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith (x) after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the Company to the
Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (y) after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a
Superior Proposal.

" _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal
made following the date hereof (on its most recently amended or modified
terms, if amended or modified) that the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in its good faith judgment (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisors and after taking into account
the terms, conditions, risks and the legal, financial, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal (including closing conditions, the likelihood and
contemplated timing of closing or financing requirements) and the Person
making such proposal) would if consummated, result in a transaction that is
more favorable to the Companys stockholders from a financial point of view
than this Agreement and the Merger; _provided_ , that the reference to "20%"
in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be a reference
to "50%." Reference to "this Agreement" and "the Merger" in this paragraph
shall be deemed to include any proposed alteration of the terms of this
Agreement or the Merger that are proposed in writing by Parent pursuant to
_Section 7.4(c)_.

 

(c) Except as permitted by this _Section 7.4(c)_, the Board of Directors of

withhold, withdraw or modify, in any manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the Company Board Recommendation, (ii) approve, recommend, endorse or
otherwise declare advisable, or publicly propose to approve,
recommend, endorse or otherwise declare advisable, an Acquisition Proposal,
(iii) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement,
(iv) fail to publicly recommend against any Acquisition Proposal (including,
for these purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of
such Acquisition Proposal by the Companys stockholders, which shall
constitute a failure to recommend against such Acquisition Proposal), or to
publicly re-affirm the Company Board Recommendation, in each case, within ten
Business Days following an Acquisition Proposal that has been publicly
announced (or such fewer number of days as remain prior to the Company
Stockholders Meeting, as it may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with
this Agreement) (any of the actions described in the foregoing clauses (i),
(ii), (iii) and (iv), a " _Change in Recommendation_ ") or (v) approve,
recommend, declare advisable or enter into any definitive acquisition
agreement, merger agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, term
sheet or other similar agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal
(such agreement, an

 



\- 46 -  " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
any time prior to the receipt of the Required Company Vote, the Board of
Directors of the Company may (x) effect a Change in Recommendation (A) in
response to a Company Intervening Event, or (B) following receipt of a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not result
from a breach of  _Section 7.4(a)_ that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is a Superior Proposal, in each case of
clauses (A) and (B) if, and only if, prior to effecting such Change in
Recommendation, (xx) the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in
good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law and (yy) the
Company complies with _Section 7.4(d)_ or (y) following receipt of a _bona
fide_ written Acquisition Proposal after the date hereof that did not result
from a breach of _Section 7.4(a)_ and that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, is a Superior Proposal, cause or permit
the Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1(f)_ for the
purpose of entering into a definitive acquisition agreement, merger agreement
or similar definitive agreement (an " _Alternative Definitive Acquisition
Agreement_ ") with respect to such Superior Proposal, if, and only if, (xx)
prior to such termination, the Board of Directors of the Company has
determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such action would reasonably
be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board
of Directors of the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable
Law, (yy) prior to such termination, the Company complies with _Section
7.4(d)_, and (zz) concurrently with such termination, (1) the Company is
entering into such Alternative Acquisition Definitive Agreement with respect
to such Superior Proposal and (2) the Company pays the Company Termination
Fee.

 

(d) Prior to the Company taking any of the actions (i) under clause (x)(A) in
the second sentence of _Section 7.4(c)_, (A) the Company shall provide
Parent with three (3) Business Days prior written notice advising Parent it
intends to effect a Change in Recommendation in response to a Company
Intervening Event and specifying, in reasonable detail, the reasons therefor,
(B) during such three (3) Business Day period, if requested by Parent, the
Company shall engage in good faith negotiations with Parent to amend the terms
and conditions of this Agreement in a manner that obviates the need to effect
a Change in Recommendation and (C) following the end of such three (3)
Business Day period, the Board of Directors of the Company, after taking into
account any modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Merger offered by Parent, shall re-determine in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel that (x) such
Intervening Event continues to necessitate a Change in Recommendation, even if
the modifications offered by Parent were to be given effect and (y) failure
to effect such Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of the
Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, or (ii) under
clause (x)(B) or clause (y) in the second sentence or _Section 7.4(c)_, (A)
the Company shall provide Parent with three (3) Business Days prior written
notice (it being understood and agreed that any amendment to the amount or
form of consideration payable in connection with the applicable Acquisition
Proposal, or any amendment to the financial or any other material terms of the
applicable Acquisition Proposal, shall require a new notice and an additional
two (2) Business

 



\- 47 -  Day period) advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company
intends to take such action, and if applicable, specifying the material terms
and conditions of, and attaching a complete copy of, the Acquisition
Proposal, (B) the Company shall, during such three (3) Business Day period (or
subsequent two (2) Business Day period), negotiate in good faith with Parent
to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement such
that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal
and (C) following the end of such three (3) Business period (or subsequent two
(2) Business Day period), the Board of Directors of the Company, after taking
into account any modifications to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
and the Merger offered by Parent, shall re-determine in good faith after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside counsel that (x) such
Acquisition Proposal continues to constitute a Superior Proposal and (y)
failure to effect such Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Board of Directors of
the Company to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(e) The Company shall promptly (but in any event within 24 hours)
after receipt or occurrence of any Acquisition Proposal or the determination
of the existence of a Company Intervening Event, as applicable (i) notify
Parent of such Acquisition Proposal or Company Intervening Event, as
applicable, and (ii) communicate the material terms and conditions of any
such Acquisition Proposal (including, if applicable, providing copies of any
written inquiries, requests, proposals or offers and any proposed agreements
relating thereto, which may be redacted to the extent necessary to protect
confidential information of the Person making such Acquisition Proposal) or
the Company Intervening Event, as applicable, to Parent and (iii) notify
Parent of any request for non-public information or to engage in negotiations
or discussions that could reasonably be expected to lead to or that
contemplate an Acquisition Proposal and communicate the materials terms and
conditions of such request. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably
apprised of the status of any Acquisition Proposal or Company Intervening
Event, as applicable, and any developments, discussions and negotiations
regarding the financial and any other material terms of the Acquisition
Proposal or request (including by providing copies of all drafts of proposed
agreements relating thereto which may be redacted to the extent necessary to
protect confidential information of the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal).

 

Section 7.5. _Stockholder Litigation_. Each of the Company and Parent shall
keep the other party hereto informed of, and consult and cooperate with such
party in connection with, any stockholder litigation or claim against such
party and/or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other
Transactions. No settlement of any such stockholder litigation shall be
agreed to without Parents prior written consent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each of Parent and the Company
shall notify the other promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) of
the commencement of any such stockholder litigation of which it has received
written notice.

Section 7.6. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release relating to
this Agreement shall be a joint press release issued by the Company and Parent
and thereafter Parent and the Company shall consult with each other before
issuing any further press release or otherwise making any public statement
(to the extent not previously issued or made in accordance with this
Agreement) with respect to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the other
Transactions. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (a) each of the foregoing
parties may, without

 



\- 48 -  such consultation or consent, make any public statement in response to
questions from the press, analysts, investors or those attending industry
conferences, make internal announcements to employees and make disclosures in
Company SEC Reports, so long as such statements are consistent with previous
press releases, public disclosures or public statements made jointly by the
parties (or individually, if approved by the other party), (b) a party may,
without the prior consent of the other party hereto, issue any such press
release or make any such public announcement or statement as may be required
by requirements under Law, and (c) the Company need not consult with Parent

or made with respect to any Change in Recommendation, Acquisition Proposal or
Superior Proposal.

 

Section 7.7. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall be permitted to take such steps as may be reasonably necessary or
advisable to cause dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) pursuant to the Transactions by each individual who is

Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 7.8. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the period beginning on the Effective Time and ending on the
first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time or, if shorter, during the
period of employment for an employee of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries following the Effective Time, Parent shall provide, or shall
cause the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries to provide, employees who
continue to be employed by the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with (i) a base salary or
hourly wage rate and annual cash incentive compensation opportunities
(excluding equity or equity-based compensation) that, in each case, are no
less favorable than those as were provided to such Continuing
Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) to the Continuing
Employees, collectively, employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based
compensation) that, in the aggregate, are substantially similar to the
employee benefits (excluding equity or equity-based compensation) provided to
such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries
to provide, to each Continuing Employee who is terminated by the Surviving
Corporation or one of its Subsidiaries without cause during the twelve (12)
month period following the Effective Time, severance benefits no less than
the severance benefits provided pursuant to the severance guidelines set forth
on _Schedule 7.8(a)_.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries to honor, in accordance with their terms, the
Company Benefit Plans set forth on _Schedule 3.18(a)_ as in effect immediately
before the Effective Time;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) nothing herein
shall prevent the Surviving Corporation from amending or terminating any such
Company Benefit in accordance with its terms and (y) nothing contained in
this  _Section 7.8(b)_ is intended to confer upon any employee any right to
continued receipt of any specific employee benefit for any specific period of
time nor require the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries to
continue any Company Benefit Plan for any specific period of time after the
Effective Date.

 



\- 49 - (c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, grant all Continuing Employees credit for any
service with the Company or its Subsidiaries earned prior to the Effective
Time for eligibility and vesting and benefit accrual (but not for benefit
accruals or benefit levels under any defined benefit pension plan,
nonqualified retirement plan, retiree welfare plan or long-term executive
incentive plan) purposes in each case under any benefit or compensation plan,
program, agreement or arrangement in which the Continuing Employees commence
to participate on or after the Effective Time (collectively, the " _New
Plans_ "), except as would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition,
Parent shall (x) cause to be waived all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively at work requirements and similar limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any New Plans
to the extent waived or satisfied by a Continuing Employee under any Company
Benefit Plan as of the date on which commencement of participation in such
New Plan begins, and (y) cause any deductible, co-insurance and covered out-
of-pocket expenses paid during the calendar year in which commencement of
participation in such New Plan begins and prior to such commencement of
participation by any Continuing Employee (or covered dependent thereof) to be
taken into account for purposes of satisfying the corresponding deductible,
coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions under such New Plan in the
year of initial participation.

(d) If the Effective Time occurs prior to the date on which the Company pays

Company or its Subsidiaries who satisfies the eligibility criteria to receive
such a bonus for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the " _2015 Bonus_ ") as
promptly as practicable following the Effective Time or, if later, as promptly
as practicable following December 31, 2015, and in any event no later than
March 15, 2016. The amount of any such 2015 Bonus shall be calculated in good
faith in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, based
on the actual performance of the Company and the employee through December 31,
2015.

 

(e) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.8_, express or implied, is intended
to confer upon any employee any right to continued employment for any period
or continued receipt of any specific employee benefit, or shall constitute an
amendment to or any other modification of any New Plan or Company Benefit Plan
or other benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement or arrangement.
Further, this _Section 7.8_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this _Section
7.8_, express or implied, is intended to create or confer upon any other
Person (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any Service Provider) any
rights, benefits, liabilities, obligations or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this _Section 7.8_.

 

Section 7.9. _Financing/Financing Assistance_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that, other than the
obligations expressly set forth in this _Section 7.9_, the Company and the
Company Related Parties have no responsibility for any financing that Parent
and Merger Sub may raise in connection with the Transactions. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company acknowledges and agrees that Parents and Merger
Subs obligation to consummate the Transactions is not subject to a financing
condition under _Article VIII_ or otherwise.

 



\- 50 - (b) (i) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent
and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions (including the terms of the so-called "market
flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter described in the Commitment
Letters or on such other terms that are no less favorable to Parent and
Merger Sub than the terms and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment
Letter (including the terms of the so-called "market flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter), and shall not permit any amendment or
modification (it being agreed that any Alternative Financing shall not be
deemed an amendment, modification or waiver) to be made to, or any waiver of
any provision under, the Commitment Letters if such amendment, modification or
waiver (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or (B) imposes new
or additional conditions or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any of the
conditions to the Financing, or otherwise expands, amends or modifies any
other provision of the Commitment Letters, in each case in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to (x) taking into account the timing of the
Marketing Period, delay or prevent or make less likely the funding of the
Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing
Date or (y) adversely impact the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company,
as applicable, to enforce its rights against other parties to the Commitment
Letters, in each of clauses (x) and (y) in any material respect ( _provided_
that Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Debt Financing Letters to add
additional lenders, arrangers, book runners and agents that have not executed
the Debt Commitment Letter as of the date hereof or in accordance with any
"market flex" provisions of the Debt Financing Letters). Parent shall promptly
deliver to the Company copies of any such amendment, modification or
replacement. For purposes of this _Section 7.9_, references to "Financing"
shall include the financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Letters as
permitted to be amended, modified or replaced by this _Section 7.9_.

 

(ii) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (A)
to maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (B) to negotiate and enter into
definitive agreements with respect to the Commitment Letters on the terms and
conditions (including the terms of the so-called "market flex" provisions
contained in the Fee Letter) contained in the Commitment Letters or on such
other terms that are no less favorable to Parent and Merger Sub than the terms
and conditions contained in the Debt Commitment Letter (including the terms of
the so-called "market flex" provisions contained in the Fee Letter), (C) to
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions to funding that are applicable to, and within the
control of, Parent and Merger Sub in the Debt Financing Letters and
such definitive agreements thereto (other than any condition where the
failure to be so satisfied is a result of the Companys failure to comply with
this _Section 7.9_) and (taking into account the timing of the Marketing
Period) to consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, including if
the conditions set forth in the Debt Financing Letters have been satisfied,
using its reasonable best efforts to cause the lenders and the other persons
committing to fund the Financing to fund the Financing at the Closing, (D) to
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters and (E) to comply with its
obligations under the Commitment Letters. Parent shall keep the Company
reasonably informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail of
the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing and provide upon
reasonable written request, to the Company copies of executed material
agreements for the 

 



\- 51 -  Debt Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, if it
could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the timely availability of
the Financings (taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period) or
the aggregate amount of the Financing to be funded at Closing, Parent and
Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt notice (x) of any breach or default
by any party to any of the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements
related to the Financing of which Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware, (y) of
the receipt of (A) any written notice or (B) other written communication, in
each case from any Financing Source with respect to any (1) actual or
threatened breach, default, early termination or repudiation by any party to
any of the Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the
Financing of any provisions of the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing or (2) material dispute or disagreement
between or among any parties to any of the Commitment Letters or definitive
agreements related to the Financing with respect to the obligation to fund the
Financing or the amount of the Financing to be funded at the Closing (but
excluding ordinary course negotiations with respect to the terms of the
Financing), and (z) if at any time for any reason Parent or Merger Sub
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Financing on the conditions or from the sources contemplated by any of
the Commitment Letters. As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event
within two Business Days of the date the Company delivers to Parent or Merger
Sub a written request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information
reasonably requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to
in clause "(x)," "(y)" or "(z)" of the immediately preceding sentence. In the
event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the
reason therefor, Parent will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, as
promptly as reasonably practicable following the occurrence of such event,
alternative financing (in an amount sufficient to consummate the Transactions
and to pay related fees and expenses due and payable as of the Closing Date)
from the same or other sources and on terms and conditions (including the
terms of any so-called "market flex" provisions) not materially less
favorable to Parent than the terms and conditions in the Debt Financing Letter
(including the terms of any so-called "market flex" provisions contained in
any Fee Letter) (the " _Alternative Financing_ "). Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, in no event shall the reasonable best efforts of
Parent or Merger Sub be deemed or construed to require Parent or Merger Sub
to, and Parent and Merger Sub shall not be required to, (i) pay any fees or
include an additional discount in excess of those contemplated by the Debt
Financing Letters, or (ii) agree to any term that is outside of, or less
favorable than, any economic provision (including those applicable to
interest rate, margins, discounts, premiums, additional amortization or
shorter or longer tenor) that those included in the Debt Financing Letters
(including any term included in any so-called "market flex" provisions
therein). For the purposes of this Agreement, (1) the term "Debt Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or similar
agreement) with respect to any Alternative Financing arranged in
compliance herewith or any amendment, modification or supplement to any Debt
Commitment Letter made in compliance

 



\- 52 -  with this _Section 7.9_, (2) the term "Fee Letter" shall be deemed to
include any fee letter (or similar agreement) with respect to any alternative
debt Financing arranged in compliance with this _Section 7.9(b)(ii)_ and any
amendment, modification or supplement to any Fee Letter made in compliance
with this _Section 7.9_, (3) the term "Financing Source" shall be deemed
to include any lenders providing the Alternative Financing arranged in
compliance herewith.

(c) Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and Merger Sub, at Parents sole expense,
all cooperation reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing ( _provided_ in all cases that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), which shall include:

 

(i) furnishing Parent and Merger Sub and their Financing Sources (A) as
promptly as reasonably practicable following Parents request, with the
Required Information and such pertinent and customary information, to the
extent such pertinent and customary information is reasonably available to the
Company, regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries and any supplements
thereto, as may be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the
consummation of the Debt Financing and (B) in the event that the Effective
Time occurs after March 16, 2016, audited consolidated financial statements
of the Company for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 no later than
ninety (90) days following the end of such fiscal year;

 

(ii) using reasonable best efforts to cause senior management and other
Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries participate in a
reasonable number of meetings (including any customary one-on-one meetings),
presentations, due diligence sessions, drafting sessions and sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the Debt Financing, including direct
contact between senior management and other Representatives of the Company
and its Subsidiaries on the one hand and the actual and prospective Financing
Sources and potential lenders and investors in the Debt Financing on the other
hand;

 

(iii) reasonably assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, bank information memoranda (including the delivery of
customary authorization and representation letters as required by the Debt
Commitment Letter), related lender presentations and similar documents
required in connection with the Debt Financing and reasonably
assisting Parent with the preparation of any pro forma financial information
required by the Debt Commitment Letter (so long as the Company shall have been
furnished information relating to the proposed aggregate amount of debt and
equity financing, together with assumed indicative interest rates and assumed
fees and expenses related to the incurrence of such debt or equity financing,
and assumed cost savings, synergies and similar adjustments (in each case, if
any) for the Transactions);  _provided_ that any rating agency presentations,
bank information memoranda, lender presentation and similar documents required
in connection with the Debt Financing shall contain disclosure reflecting
that, after giving effect to the Merger, the Surviving Corporation and/or its
Subsidiaries will be the obligors in respect of such Debt Financing;

 



\- 53 - (iv) using reasonable best efforts to assist Parent in connection with
the preparation of definitive financing documents (including pledge and
security agreements and including by providing any information necessary for
the preparation and completion of any schedules to any such definitive
financing agreements) as reasonably requested by Parent and otherwise
reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral and the granting of
security interests in respect of the Debt Financing; _provided_ that such
documents will not take effect with respect to the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries until the Effective Time;

(v) provide Parent all documentation and other information with respect to
the Company and its Subsidiaries as shall have been reasonably requested in
writing by Parent at least nine (9) Business Days prior to the Closing Date

rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act, in each case no later than
four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date;

 

(vi) obtain a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company in the
form attached to the Debt Commitment Letter with respect to solvency matters;

(vii) deliver notices of prepayment within the time periods required by the
relevant agreements governing indebtedness and obtaining customary payoff
letters, lien terminations and instruments of discharge to the extent, and in
the manner, contemplated by _Section 7.10_, and give any other necessary
notices, to allow for the payoff, discharge and termination in full at the
Closing of all indebtedness required by the Debt Commitment Letters to be
terminated; and

 

(viii) taking all corporate actions and providing and executing customary
closing documents, in each case and subject to the occurrence of the Closing,
reasonably requested by Parent; _provided_ that the foregoing shall not
require the Board of Directors of the Company to approve the Debt Financing or
any matters related thereto.

 

(d) Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company
for all out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including attorneys and
accountants costs and expenses) incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with the cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries
contemplated by this _Section 7.9_ and shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective representatives from and
against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing, any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this
_Section 7.9_ and any information used in connection therewith (except with
respect to any information provided in writing by the Company or its
Subsidiaries specifically for use in connection therewith), and the Limited
Guarantee shall guarantee the reimbursement and indemnification obligations of
Parent pursuant to this paragraph of this _Section 7.9_.

 



\- 54 - (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section
7.9_, (i) except with respect to any rating agency engagement letters and
authorization and representation letters, none of the Company, its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective directors or officers shall be
obligated to adopt or approve resolutions or execute consents to approve or

nothing contained in this _Section 7.9_ or otherwise shall require the
Company or its Subsidiaries, prior to the Effective Time, to be an obligor
with respect to the Debt Financing) and (iii) none of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or representatives shall be required to pay or incur
any liability for any commitment or other fee or pay or incur any other
liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective Time
unless subject to reimbursement or indemnity.

 

(f) Nothing in this _Section 7.9_ shall require such cooperation by the
Company to the extent it would (i) cause any covenant of this Agreement to
fail to be satisfied or otherwise cause any breach of this Agreement (unless
waived by Parent), (ii) require the Company or its Subsidiaries to take any
action that will conflict with or violate the Company
Organizational Documents or any requirements under applicable Law or result
in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any Material Contract to which the
Company or its Subsidiaries is a party (in each case prior to the Effective
Time) or (iii) result in any officer or director of the Company or its

compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this Agreement and

partys right to specific enforcement, and (z) the right of specific
enforcement is an integral part of the Transactions and without that right,
neither the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

(ii) Each party further agrees that (A) no such party will oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as
provided herein on the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at
law or that an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity and (B) no other party or any other Person shall
be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in

required to have occurred pursuant to _Section 1.2_ on the terms set forth in
the Debt Financing Letters or the definitive agreements in respect of the Debt
Financing, and (C) the Company has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Parent
that (x) all conditions to the Companys obligation to consummate the Closing
set forth in _Section 8.3_ have been satisfied or waived (other than
those conditions that are to be satisfied by action taken at the Closing (
_provided_ such conditions would be satisfied or waived by the Company as of
such date)) and (y) if specific performance is granted and the Financing is
funded, then the Closing will occur; _provided_ that under no circumstances
shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of (1)
specific performance of the consummation of the Merger and the other
Transactions and (2) the payment of the Parent Termination Fee.

Section 10.5. _Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting

other judicial or administrative body to be null, void or unenforceable, said
provision shall survive to the extent it is not so declared, and all of the
other provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Upon
such declaration by any court or other judicial or administrative body that
any part of this Agreement is null, void or unenforceable, the parties hereto
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the
original intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law in an acceptable manner to the end that
the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the parties hereto intend that the provisions of _Article IX_ and 
_Section 10.4(c)_, including the remedies and limitations thereon (including

manner that diminishes a partys rights hereunder or increases a partys
liability or obligations hereunder or under the Debt Financing Letters or the
Limited Guarantee.

 

(b) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. If any ambiguity or question of intent arises, this Agreement

authorship of any provision of this Agreement.
