Delivery of Letters of Transmittal at the Closing_. At the Closing and as
contemplated by _Section 2.04(e)_, Parent shall pay, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Paying Agent
(which designated account, and the wire instructions therefor, 

 



16  shall be provided to Parent no later than three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date) an aggregate amount equal to the Class B Redemption
Consideration, _plus_ an amount equal to the Merger Consideration minus the

Effective Time and except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.08(c)_, the
Paying Agent shall deliver the consideration payable to each Stockholder as
set forth in _Section 2.07_ who has delivered a duly executed Letter of
Transmittal, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by such Stockholder to the Paying Agent prior to the

Consideration receivable by such Stockholder under this Agreement shall be
aggregated for all Company Common Stock held by such Stockholder, as
applicable, and following such aggregation any fractional cents shall be
rounded to the nearest whole cent. Stockholder Representative shall ensure
that the Merger Consideration Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with,
and that payment of the Class B Redemption Consideration and Merger
Consideration shall comply in all respects with, the Company Certificate of

any Stockholder failing to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to the Paying
Agent at or prior to the Closing, the Paying Agent shall promptly thereafter
mail to any such Stockholder at the address listed in the Companys books and

for the payment to such Stockholder of the consideration to which he, she or
it is entitled under _Section 2.07_. Upon delivery to the Paying Agent of
such appropriate Letter of Transmittal, the Paying Agent shall deliver to the
Stockholder the applicable amounts as set forth in _Section 2.07_.

(d) _No Interest Accrual; Conditions to Payment_. No interest will be paid or
accrued on the amounts payable upon the delivery of the Letters of
Transmittal. If payment is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Company Common Stock registered, it shall be a
condition of payment that the Person requesting such payment shall pay any
transfer or similar Taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other
than the holder of record or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Paying
Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until the respective
Letter of Transmittal is delivered with respect to any share of Redeemed Class
B Common Stock or Company Common Stock, such share of Company Common Stock
shall represent for all purposes only the right to receive payment of the
amounts specified in _Section 2.07_ in respect of such share of Redeemed
Class B Common Stock and Company Common Stock, as applicable.

 

(e) _Unclaimed Funds_. Any portion of the funds deposited with the Paying
Agent which remains undistributed to the Stockholders for one (1) year after
the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Company for all
purposes, and any Stockholder who has not theretofore complied with this
_Section 2.08_ shall thereafter look only as a general claimant to
the Surviving Company for payment of the sums to which such Stockholder is
entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

(f) _No Liability_. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Company shall be liable
to any Stockholder for any cash delivered by the Paying Agent or the Surviving
Company in good faith to the appropriate Governmental Authority pursuant to an
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

 



17 (g) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers
on the Surviving Companys equity transfer books of any Company Common Stock
that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, the equity transfer books of the Company shall be closed.

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or shall be
entitled to cause the Paying Agent to deduct and withhold, such amounts as may
be required under the Code or any provision of federal, state, local or
foreign Tax law to be deducted and withheld from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Stockholder pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted and withheld by Parent and paid over to the
appropriate Taxing authority, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such
Stockholder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by
Parent, and Parent shall disburse such deducted or withheld amounts to
the applicable Tax authority.

Section 2.09 Appraisal Rights. Each issued and outstanding share of Company
Common Stock that is held by a Stockholder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing or executed an enforceable waiver of
appraisal rights to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and, in the case of
any Person required to have exercised appraisal rights under Section 262 of
the DGCL as of the Effective Time of the Merger in order to preserve such
rights, with respect to which appraisal rights under the DGCL have been
properly exercised, will not be converted into the right to receive any
portion of the applicable Merger Consideration and will be converted into the
right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect thereto
as provided by the DGCL, unless and until the Stockholder of any such share
of Company Common Stock will have failed to perfect or will have effectively
withdrawn or lost his, her or its right to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL, in which case such share of Company Common Stock will thereupon be
deemed, as of the Effective Time, to have been cancelled and retired and to
have ceased to exist and been converted into the right to receive, upon
surrender of such certificate in accordance with _Section 2.08_, a portion,
without interest, in accordance with this Agreement, of the Merger
Consideration payable with respect to such share of Company Common Stock. From
and after the Effective Time, no Stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights
will be entitled to vote his, her or its shares of Company Common Stock for
any purpose or to receive payment of dividends or other distributions on his,
her or its shares of Company Common Stock (except dividends or other
distributions payable to Stockholders of record at a date prior to the
Effective Time, or dividends that accrued thereon prior to the Effective
Time). Shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been
properly exercised, and not subsequently withdrawn, lost or failed to be
perfected, are referred to herein as " _Dissenting Shares_." For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as a waiver
of the drag along rights contained in Section 3 of the Stockholders Agreement.

 



18 Section 2.10 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all
rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and directors

authorized (in the name of Merger Sub and in the name of the Company) to take
such action.

Covered Claims, upon satisfaction of any Covered Claim after the Claim
Deadline, that portion of the Holdback Amount that is no longer subject to any
remaining Covered Claims; and (z) twenty-four (24) months after the Closing
Date (the " _Release Date_ "), any portion of the Holdback Amount which has

of any officers and/or directors contained in the Companys and each of its
Subsidiaries certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing
document) in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (unless required

favorable as the Companys existing policies with respect to matters existing
or occurring at or prior to the Closing Date; provided that the aggregate
annual premium for such "tail" insurance policy shall not exceed $75,000 (such
amount, the " _Maximum Annual Premium_ "); further provided, that if such
aggregate annual premium exceeds the Maximum Annual Premium, the Company shall

obligations set forth in this  _Section 6.05_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.05(c)_ will apply to all of the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

(d) The obligations of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their
Subsidiaries under this _Section 6.05_ shall not be terminated or modified
in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to whom this _Section
6.05_ applies without the consent of such affected Person.

on a timely basis all conditions set forth in the Financing Letter required
for the Closing Date; (v) negotiating, executing and delivering definitive
agreements with respect to the Financing that reflect the terms contained in
the Financing Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto)
or on such other terms acceptable to Parent and its financing sources; and
(vi) in the event that the conditions set forth in  _Sections 8.01_ and
_8.02_ and the conditions expressly set forth in the tenth paragraph of the
Financing Letter (as in effect on the date hereof) have been satisfied or,
upon funding would be satisfied, causing the financing providers to fund the
full amount of the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt notice of
any actual breach, repudiation or threatened or anticipated breach or
repudiation by any party to the Financing Letter of which Parent or its
Affiliates becomes aware relating to the obligation to fund the Financing.

Parent, (ii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain Alternate Financing and
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the Closing
Date, and (iii) use reasonable best efforts to obtain, and when obtained,
provide the Company with a true and complete copy of, a new financing
commitment that provides for such Alternate Financing; provided, that any such
Alternate Financing shall (x) comply with all limitations on amendments,
modifications and replacements of the Financing set forth in this _Section
6.06_, (y) the amount of such Alternate Financing shall be at least an amount
sufficient to pay the Class B Redemption Consideration, the Merger
Consideration and all fees, costs and expenses necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (z) such Alternate Financing
shall not contain conditions to the receipt of the funds from such Alternate
Financing that are materially less favorable in the aggregate to Parent than
the conditions of the Financing that such Alternate Financing is replacing.
Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall amend, modify, supplement,
restate, assign, substitute or replace the Financing Letter except for (i)
substitutions and replacements pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence
and (ii) amendments, modifications, supplements, restatements, assignments,
substitutions or replacements which (A) do not reduce the aggregate amount of
the Financing (including by increasing the amount of fees to be paid or
original issue discount unless the Financing is increased by a corresponding
amount or the Financing is otherwise made available to fund such fees or
original issue discount) or (B) do not impose new or additional conditions or
otherwise expand, amend or modify any other provision of the Financing Letter,
in a manner that would reasonably be expected to (x) materially delay or
prevent or make less likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of
the conditions to the Financing) on the Closing Date or (y) adversely impact
the ability of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, to enforce
its rights against other parties to the Financing Letter or the definitive
agreements with respect thereto, in each of clauses "(x)" and "(y)", in any
material respect (provided that Parent and Merger Sub may amend the Financing
Letter to add additional lenders, arrangers, bookrunners, agents and investors
as permitted therein). Parent shall promptly deliver to the Company copies of
any such amendment, modification or replacement. Parent shall not consent to
any assignment of rights or obligations under the Financing Letter, other than
as permitted by the terms of the Financing Letter, without the prior written
approval of the Company, such approval not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Parent shall keep the Company informed in
reasonable detail of the

 



51 status of Parents efforts to arrange the Financing. Upon the reasonable
request of the Company or Stockholder Representative, Parent will confirm (y)
with its financing sources their intent and ability to perform, and the
availability of the Financing, under the Financing Letter, subject only to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions in the Financing Letter, and (z)
that it is not aware of any event or condition that could reasonably be
expected to result in the failure of any conditions in the Financing Letter.
Neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall take any action with respect
to the Financing that could reasonably be expected to materially delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this _Section 6.06_ or in any other
provision of this Agreement, in no event shall Parent or Merger Sub be
required (A) to amend or waive any of the terms or conditions hereof or (B) to
consummate the Closing prior to the date specified in _Section 2.04(a)_.

 

(b) During the period beginning on the date hereof and ending on the Closing
Date, the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with Parent
and its Representatives to arrange Financing for Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and for the post-Closing operations of
Parent, at Parents sole expense, including by (i) upon reasonable

due diligence meetings with prospective Financing Sources and their
Representatives, (ii) assisting Parent with its preparation and negotiation of

into any Contract or provide or cause to be provided any legal opinion,
officer certificate or commitment or make any representations or warranties,
in each case, except in connection with the Closing), (iii) causing the
senior management of the Company to provide reasonable access in connection
with due diligence investigations, assistance with customary marketing

consolidated financial statements; and (C) the four (4) quarter break out of
the audited statements of operations for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2013
and July 31, 2012 (clauses (iv)(A), (iv)(B), (iv)(C) of this  _Section
6.06(b)_, collectively, the " _Historical Company Group Financials_ "); (v)

or any of its Subsidiaries, prior to the Effective Time, to be an obligor with
respect to the Financing), (iii) none of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be required to pay or incur
any liability for any commitment or other fee or pay or incur any other
liability in connection with the Financing prior to the Effective Time and
(iv) nothing in this _Section 6.06(b)_ shall require such cooperation by the
Company to the extent it would (x) require the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to take any action that will conflict with or violate the
Companys organizational documents or any Applicable Law or result in the
contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
violation or breach of, or default under, any Contract to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is a party (in each case prior to the Effective Time)
or (y) result in any officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries incurring any personal liability with respect to any matters
relating to the Financing.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, neither (i) the Companys cooperation with
respect to the preparation of financial statements, forecasts of balance
sheets, income statements and cash flow statements, historical, financial and
other information (including the Historical Company Group Financials) nor
(ii) the availability, or Parents obtaining, of the Financing is, or shall be
deemed, a condition to Parent and Merger Subs obligation to consummate the
Merger.

 

(d) The Company hereby consents to the use of its logos in connection with the
Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not
intended to or reasonably likely to harm or disparage the Company or the

to review the use of such logos prior to the usage in connection with the
Financing. Parent shall promptly, upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys and accountants costs and expenses) incurred by the
Company in connection with the cooperation of the Company contemplated by

Representatives from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or

therewith (except with respect to any information provided in writing by the
Company specifically for us in connection therewith).

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Parent understands and acknowledges that under the terms of this Agreement,
the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the Merger are not in
any way contingent upon or otherwise subject to this _Section 6.06_, the
consummation by Parent or Merger Sub of any financing arrangements, the
obtaining by Parent or Merger Sub of any financing or the availability, grant,
provision or extension of any financing to Parent or Merger Sub.

Section 10.03 Remedies; Specific Performance.

 

(a) _Acknowledgement Regarding Available Remedies_. After the Effective Time,
the rights and remedies of the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not
alternative). Each of the

 



59  parties to this Agreement acknowledges and agrees that the other parties to
this Agreement would be irreparably damaged in the event that any of the terms
or provisions of this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or otherwise are breached. Therefore, each of the parties to
this Agreement hereby agrees that (a) the parties to this Agreement shall be
entitled to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of any of
the terms or provisions of this Agreement, and to enforce specifically the
performance by each other party hereto under this Agreement, (b) (i) the
provisions set forth in _Section 10.03(b)(i)_ are not intended to and do not
adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a breach of this
Agreement and (ii) shall not be construed to diminish or otherwise impair in
any respect any partys rights to specific enforcement and (c) the right of
specific enforcement is an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and without that right, neither the Company nor Parent would
have entered into this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement hereby agrees
to waive the defense in any such suit that the other parties to this Agreement
have an adequate remedy at law and to interpose no opposition, legal or
otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction or specific performance as a
remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any requirement to post any bond or other
type of security in connection with obtaining such relief.

(b)  _Remedies of Parent and the Company_.

(i) _Specific Performance_. Prior to the valid termination of this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.01_, each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to
seek and obtain an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief
in the event of a breach or threatened breach of any of the provisions
of this Agreement by the other party in the courts described in _Section
10.08_ and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, including
such partys obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

(ii) _Termination_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
be entitled to terminate this Agreement in accordance with _Section 9.01_.

(iii) _Monetary Remedies_. __

 

(A) _Agreement to Indemnify Parent Indemnified Parties_. __

 

(1) From and after the Closing (but subject to this _Section 10.03_), each
Stockholder (each, a " _Stockholder Indemnifying Party_ " and collectively,
the " _Stockholder Indemnifying Parties_ ") shall severally (based on each
such holders aggregate pro rata amount of Class A Merger Consideration, Class
B/C Merger Consideration and Class B Redemption Consideration reflected on
the Merger Consideration Schedule), and not jointly, indemnify and hold
harmless Parent (and after Closing, the Company Group) and their officers,
directors, agents, representatives and employees, and each person, if any,
who controls or may control Parent (and after Closing, the Company Group)
within the meaning of the Securities Act or the

 



60  Exchange Act (each hereinafter referred to individually as a " _Parent
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively as the " _Parent Indemnified Parties_ ")
from and against any and all damages, losses, claims, liabilities, demands,
Taxes, charges, suits, penalties, costs, and expenses (including (i) court
costs, (ii) attorneys fees and (iii) other expenses incurred in investigating
and preparing for, or otherwise in connection with, any litigation or
proceeding, but excluding (x) any special, exemplary or punitive damages and
(y) the actual or imputed value of the services or time of employees, officers
or directors of the applicable party(ies)) (collectively, " _Damages_ "),
associated with a breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement of the
Stockholder Representative, any Company Group Member with respect to covenants
to be performed prior to the Closing, and any Specified Stockholder;
_provided_ , that, in no event will a Stockholder Indemnifying Partys
indemnification obligation exceed the aggregate consideration reflected on the
Merger Consideration Schedule paid to such Stockholder Indemnifying Party,
and no Stockholder Indemnifying Party shall be liable or responsible, directly
or indirectly, for any Damages for any breach of a covenant or agreement
hereunder specifically and solely applicable to another Stockholder;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the payment of any Damages arising from or
related to any Special Indemnification Matters will be governed exclusively by
_Section 10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_ (and shall not be subject to payment as set
forth in this _Section 10.03(b)(iii)(A)(1)_) and shall be subject to the
additional limitations therein. For the avoidance of doubt, none of the
representations and warranties of the parties in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall (A) survive the
Effective Time or (B) be subject to indemnification.

 

(2) From and after the Closing (but subject to this _Section 10.03_), each
Stockholder Indemnifying Party shall severally (based on each such holders
aggregate pro rata amount of Class B/C Merger Consideration reflected on the
Merger Consideration Schedule), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless
the Parent Indemnified Parties from and against any and all Damages resulting
from, arising out of, or associated with the matters set forth on _Section
10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_ of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Special
Indemnification Matters_ "), _provided_ , that, with respect to the Special
Indemnification Matters, the following limitations shall apply:

 



61 a. all amounts owed to any Parent Indemnified Party under this  _Section
10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_ shall be satisfied solely and exclusively from the
Holdback Amount, and each of the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties acknowledges
that, notwithstanding the fact that the indemnification obligations of
the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties are several and not joint, the Holdback
Amount shall serve as security for all of the obligations of any of the
Stockholder Indemnifying Parties under this _Section 10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_,
jointly and not severally;

b. no Parent Indemnified Party shall be indemnified (x) unless and until such
Parent Indemnified Party incurs any Damages owed to a third party with
respect to any of the Special Indemnification Matters (the " _Covered Claims_
");

 

c. in no event will the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties indemnification
obligations under this  _Section 10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_ exceed the aggregate
amount of the Holdback Amount;

d. in no event may a Parent Indemnified Party make a claim for Damages
pursuant to this _Section 10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_ unless and until the total
amount of such claim and any other current or prior claims by Parent
Indemnified Parties under this Section 10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2), in the aggregate,
exceed $500,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), and in such event, the Parent
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all Damages
incurred or suffered by them with respect to the Covered Claims only in
excess of the Deductible (subject to the other limitations herein); and

e. the Stockholder Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to indemnify a
Parent Indemnified Party for any Damages under this _Section
10.03(b)(iii)(A)(2)_ unless a Claim Notice relating to such Damages shall have
been delivered to the Stockholder Representative on or before the Claim
Deadline, and any claims asserted in a Claim Notice from any Parent
Indemnified Party to the Stockholder Representative on or before the Claim
Deadline shall survive until the earlier of the full amount of the Holdback
Amount has been either (i) used to satisfy all such Covered Claims or (ii) has
been distributed by Parent to the Paying Agent for distribution to the
Stockholders on the Release Date pursuant to _Section 2.11_ of
this Agreement.

 



62 (B) _Agreement to Indemnify Stockholder Indemnified Parties_. From and after
the Closing (but subject to this _Section 10.03_), Parent and the Company
Group will jointly and severally indemnify each Stockholder and their
officers, directors, members, managers, partners, agents, representatives,
stockholders and employees, and each person, if any, who controls or may
control such Stockholder within the meaning of the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (each hereinafter referred to individually as a " _Stockholder
Indemnified Party_ " and collectively as the " _Stockholder Indemnified
Parties_ ") from any Damages associated with a breach of (i) any covenant or
agreement of Parent or Merger Sub in this Agreement or (ii) any covenant or
agreement of the Company Group (including the Surviving Corporation) in this
Agreement with respect to covenants to be performed after the Closing.

 

(C) _Procedure for Indemnification._ A party validly seeking indemnification
hereunder (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give written notice (a " _Claim
Notice_ ") to any entity or Person who is obligated to provide indemnification
(an " _Indemnifying Party_ ") for any claim under this _Section
10.03(b)(iii)_ (an " _Indemnification Claim_ "), reasonably promptly, but in
any event (A) prior to expiration of any applicable survival period set forth
in _Section 10.01_, if any, and (B) if such Indemnification Claim relates
to the assertion against an Indemnified Party of any claim by a third party
(a " _third party action_ "), within forty-five (45) days after receipt by the
Indemnified Party of written notice of a legal process relating to such
third party action; provided, however, that the failure to so notify the
Indemnifying Party within such time period shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Party of any obligation or liability to the Indemnified Party, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party demonstrates that its ability to resolve
such Indemnification Claim is materially and adversely affected thereby. An
Indemnified Party shall not submit a Claim Notice unless it certifies in
writing that it believes in good faith that it is entitled to be indemnified
with respect to the Damages specified in such Claim Notice.

(D) _Third Party Action._ The Indemnifying Party (or the Stockholder
Representative on behalf of any or all Stockholder Indemnifying Parties) shall
have the right to assume control of the defense of, settle, or otherwise
dispose of such third party action on such terms as it deems appropriate;
_provided_ , _however_ , that:

 



63 (1) The Indemnified Party shall be entitled, at its own expense, to
participate in the defense of such third party action; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Indemnifying Party shall pay the attorneys fees of the Indemnified
Party if (i) the employment of separate counsel shall have been authorized in
a writing making express reference to this subsection and signed by such
Indemnifying Party in connection with the defense of such third party action,
(ii) the Indemnifying Party shall not have employed counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Indemnified Party to have charge of such third party
action, (iii) the Indemnified Party shall have reasonably concluded that there
are defenses available to such Indemnified Party that are different from or
additional to those available to the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) the
Indemnified Partys counsel shall in good faith have advised the Indemnified
Party in writing, with a copy delivered to the Indemnifying Party, that there
is a conflict of interest that would make it reasonable to determine that it
is inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct to have
common counsel;

 

(2) The Indemnifying Party shall obtain the prior written approval of the
Indemnified Party before entering into or making any settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment of the validity of such third party action or any
liability in respect thereof if, pursuant to or as a result of such
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment, injunctive or
other equitable relief would be imposed against the Indemnified Party or if,
in the opinion of the Indemnified Party, such settlement, compromise,
admission, or acknowledgment would have an adverse effect on its business;

 

(3) No Indemnifying Party shall consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement that does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by each claimant or plaintiff to each Indemnified Party of a
release from all liability in respect of such third-party action;

 

(4) The Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to control (but shall be
entitled to participate at its own expense in the defense of), and the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to have sole control over, the defense or
settlement, compromise, admission, or acknowledgment of any third party
action: (i) as to which the Indemnifying Party fails to assume the defense
within a reasonable length of time, (ii) to the extent the third party action
seeks an injunction, or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Party,
and (iii) if the Indemnifying Party does not irrevocably agree in
writing that no damages arising out of or related to such claim or demand are
obligations of the Indemnified Party pursuant hereto

 



64  and that any damages arising out of or related to such claim or demand are
within the scope of and may be subject to indemnification hereunder, subject
to the indemnification limitations set forth in this _Section 10.03_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Indemnified Party shall make no settlement,
compromise, admission, or acknowledgment that would give rise to liability on
the part of any Indemnifying Party without the prior written consent of such
Indemnifying Party;

(5) The parties hereto shall extend reasonable cooperation in connection with
the defense of any third party action pursuant to this _Section 10.03_ and,
in connection therewith, shall furnish such records, information, and
testimony and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,
hearings, trials, and appeals as may be reasonably requested, subject in all
instances to appropriate agreements respecting confidentiality and use, such
as, but not limited to, protective orders, as is reasonable under the
circumstances; and

 

(6) The parties agree that the provisions of this Section 10.03(b)(iii)(D)
shall not apply to the Special Indemnification Matters.

(E) _Sole Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud, or for claims permitted by
_Article 9_ if this Agreement is terminated, all monetary liability of the
parties pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be limited to claims made by the Parent Indemnified Parties or
Stockholder Indemnified Parties under this  _Section 10.03(b)(iii)_, which
shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedy of the parties available in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether at law or in equity, in contract, tort or otherwise). In furtherance
of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
Applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of action, known
or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future,
that such party may have against the other party or its Representatives, as
the case may be, arising under or based upon any Applicable Law (including any
securities law, common law or otherwise) for any breach of the representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement.

(F) _Cooperation_. The parties shall cooperate with each other,
as applicable, with respect to resolving any claim or liability under this
Agreement. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, providing
any additional information that may be reasonably requested by a party to
allow such party to assess the validity of any potential or pending claim.

 



65 (G) _Reduction by Insurance Proceeds_. The amount payable by an Indemnifying
Party to an Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages arising under this
Agreement shall be reduced by the amount of any insurance proceeds actually
received by the Indemnified Party with respect to such Damages, and each of
the parties hereto hereby agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
collect insurance proceeds to which it is entitled in respect of any such
Damages.

 

Section 10.04 Amendments and Waivers.

 

(a) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an
amendment, by each party to this Agreement or, in the case of a waiver, by

, that any amendment or modification of this proviso or _Section 9.02_,

Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 

(b) No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies
herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or
remedies provided by Applicable Law.

Section 10.05 Expenses; Indebtedness _._ Except as otherwise provided
herein, (a) all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement, including all third-party legal, accounting, financial advisory,
consulting or other fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger
and the transactions contemplated thereby, shall be paid by the party
incurring such cost or expense; _provided_ , that the Transaction Expenses and
Closing Repaid Indebtedness will be paid prior to, or simultaneously with, the
Closing in accordance with  _Section 2.04_.

Section 10.06 Binding Effect; Benefit; Assignment.

 

(a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and
assigns. No provision of this Agreement is intended to confer any rights,
benefits, remedies, obligations or liabilities hereunder upon any Person other
than the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
_provided_ , that the DandO Indemnitees shall be express third party
beneficiaries of _Section 6.05_. In addition, the Financing Sources shall be
deemed to be third party beneficiaries with respect to _Section 9.02_, the
proviso to  _Section 10.04_, _Section 10.08_ and _Section 10.09_ and will
have the rights provided for therein.

(b) No party may assign, delegate or otherwise transfer any of its rights or
obligations under this Agreement without the written consent of each other
party hereto, except that Parent or Merger Sub may transfer or assign its
rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in
part, to (i) one or more of their Affiliates at any time and/or (ii) after the
Effective Time, to any Person; _provided_ that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve Parent or Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder or
enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to
Parent or Merger Sub.

 



66 Section 10.07 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect
to principles of conflicts of laws that would require the application of the
laws of any other jurisdiction.

 

Section 10.08 Jurisdiction.

 

(a) The parties hereto agree that any Proceeding seeking to enforce any
provision of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with,
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court,
and each of the parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of
such courts (and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such
Proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any
objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any
such Proceeding in any such court or that any such Proceeding brought in any
such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such
Proceeding may be served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or
without the jurisdiction of any such court. Without limiting the foregoing,
each party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in
_Section 10.02_ shall be deemed effective service of process on such party.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in _Section 10.08(a)_ to the contrary, with
respect to any action or proceeding of any kind or description (whether in
law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) involving
any Financing Source arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
agreements delivered in connection herewith or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, the Financing or the Financing
Letter or the performance of services thereunder, each of the parties hereto
agrees that (i) such action or proceeding shall be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York or any New York State court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan and
any appellate court therefrom and (ii) they shall not bring or permit any of
their respective Affiliates to bring any action or proceeding referred to in
this _Section 10.08(b)_, or voluntarily support any other Person in bringing
any such action or proceeding, in any other courts.

 

Section 10.09 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (INCLUDING IN RESPECT OF THE FINANCING).

 

Section 10.10 Counterparts; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be signed in any
number of counterparts, each of which shall be an original, with the same
effect as if the signatures thereto and hereto were upon the same instrument.
This Agreement shall become effective when each party hereto shall have
received a counterpart hereof signed by all of the other parties
hereto. Until and unless each party has received a counterpart hereof signed
by the other party hereto, this Agreement shall have no effect and no party
shall have any right or obligation hereunder (whether by virtue of any other
oral or written agreement or other

 



67  communication). The exchange of a fully executed Agreement (in counterparts
or otherwise) by electronic transmission in .PDF format or by facsimile shall
be sufficient to bind the parties to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

Section 10.11 Entire Agreement. This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
and each of the documents, instruments and agreements delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including each of the
Exhibits and the Disclosure Schedule, and the Transaction Documents,

understandings, both oral and written, between the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.12 Severability _._ If any term, provision, covenant or restriction
of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
Governmental Authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of
the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.

 

Section 10.13 Time is of the Essence _._ Time is of the essence with respect
to the performance of this Agreement.

 

Section 10.14 Legal Representation _._ Each of the parties to this Agreement
hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives, that
Kirkland and Ellis LLP may serve as counsel to the Stockholder Representative
and its Affiliates (collectively, the " _Stockholder Group_ "), on the one
hand, and the Company Group, on the other hand, in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and that, following
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, Kirkland and Ellis LLP
(or any successor) may serve as counsel to (x) the Stockholder Group or
Representatives of the Stockholder Group or (y) any other Stockholder in the
event such Person so requests, in either case in connection with any
litigation, claim or obligation arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other matter
notwithstanding such representation (or any continued representation) of the
Company Group, and each of the parties hereto hereby consents thereto and
waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom, and each of such parties
shall cause any Affiliate thereof to consent to waive any conflict of interest
arising from such representation. Each of the parties to this Agreement
further agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure any privilege attaching
as a result of Kirkland and Ellis LLPs service as counsel to the Company Group
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will
survive the Closing and will remain in effect, provided that such privilege
from and after the Closing will be jointly controlled by the Stockholder
Representative. As to any privileged attorney-client communications between
Kirkland and Ellis LLP and the Company Group (including the Company) prior to
the Closing Date relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Privileged Communications_ "), Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company, and each of its Subsidiaries together with any of their respective
Affiliates, Subsidiaries, successors or assigns, agree that no such party may
use or rely on any of the Privileged Communications in any action against or
involving any of the parties after the Closing.

 



68 Section 10.15 _Stockholder Representative_.

 

(a) _Designation_. The parties have agreed that it is desirable to designate a
representative to act on behalf of the Stockholders for certain limited
purposes. Thoma Bravo, LLC shall serve as representative of the Stockholders
with respect to the matters expressly set forth in this Agreement to be
performed by the Stockholder Representative.

 

(b) _Authority_. The Company and, by approval of the Merger Agreement and each
Stockholders submission of a Letter of Transmittal, each of the Stockholders
agrees to be bound by the restrictions set forth in _Section 6.03_ (and with
regard to each Specified Stockholder, _Section 6.07_) and the provisions of
_Section 10.03(b)(iii)_ and this  _Section 10.15_ and irrevocably appoints
the Stockholder Representative as the agent, proxy and attorney-in-fact for
such Stockholder for all purposes of this Agreement and in any other document
delivered in connection herewith (including the full power and authority on
such Stockholders behalf: (i) to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby; (ii) to amend this Agreement (to the extent permitted by Applicable
Law) or waive any provision hereof; (iii) to disburse any funds received
hereunder to such Stockholder and each other Stockholder; (iv) to execute such
further instruments of assignment as Parent or Merger Sub shall reasonably
request; (v) to settle, litigate or dispute, in its sole discretion, any claim
or liability in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby; (vi) to receive notices and communications for and on
behalf of any Stockholder Indemnifying Party under this Agreement; (vii) to
take all other actions to be taken by or on behalf of such Stockholder in
connection herewith; and (viii) to do each and every act and exercise any and
all rights which such Stockholder or the Stockholders collectively are
permitted or required to do or exercise under this Agreement). The Stockholder
Representative may resign at any time and the Stockholder Representative may
be removed only by the vote of Persons which collectively owned, as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, more than 50% of the Class B Common
Stock (the " _Required Holders_ "). Each of the Stockholders agrees that such
agency and proxy are coupled with an interest, are therefore irrevocable
without the consent of the Stockholder Representative (except as set forth in
the immediately preceding sentence) and shall survive the death, incapacity,
illness, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or other inability to act of
any Stockholder. All decisions and actions by the Stockholder Representative
(to the extent authorized by this Agreement) shall be binding upon all of the
Stockholders, and no Stockholder shall have the right to object,
dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. The Stockholder
Representative shall be entitled to engage such counsel, experts, consultants
and other advisors as it shall deem necessary in connection with exercising
its powers and performing its functions hereunder and (in the absence of bad
faith on the part of the Stockholder Representative) shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on the opinions and advice of such Persons. The Stockholder
Representative may (but need not) consult with any Stockholder in connection
with exercising its powers and performing its functions hereunder and each
Stockholder shall cooperate with and offer reasonable assistance to the
Stockholder Representative in connection therewith. In the event that
the Stockholder Representative initially

 



69  appointed pursuant to this Agreement and the Letters of Transmittal ( _i.e._
, Thoma Bravo, LLC) has resigned or been removed, the Company and, by approval
of the Merger Agreement and each Stockholders submission of a Letter of
Transmittal, each of the Stockholders irrevocably appoints Thoma Bravo Fund X,
L.P. to serve as a new Stockholder Representative, which appointment shall
become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by Thoma Bravo Fund X,
L.P. If Thoma Bravo Fund X, L.P. does not accept such appoint, or if Thoma
Bravo Fund X, L.P. resigns or has been removed, then a new Stockholder
Representative shall be appointed by a vote of the Required Holders, such
appointment to become effective upon the written acceptance thereof by the new
Stockholder Representative. Written notice of any such resignation, removal or
appointment of a Stockholder Representative shall be delivered by the
Stockholder Representative to Parent promptly after such action is taken.

(c) _Authority; Indemnification_. Each of the Stockholders agrees
that Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving Company shall be entitled to rely
on any action taken by the Stockholder Representative without independent
inquiry into the capacity of the Stockholder Representative to so act, on
behalf of such Stockholder, pursuant to _Section 10.15(b)_ (an " _Authorized
Action_ "), and that each Authorized Action shall be binding on each
Stockholder as fully as if such Stockholder had taken such Authorized Action;
provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative will have no
obligation to act on behalf of any Stockholder. Parent and Merger Sub agree
that the Stockholder Representative shall have no liability to Parent or
Merger Sub for any Authorized Action (except for those arising out of the
Stockholder Representatives fraud). All actions, notices, communications and
determinations by the Stockholder Representative to carry out such functions
shall conclusively be deemed to have been authorized by, and shall be binding
upon, the Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative will at all times be
entitled to rely on any directions received from the Required Holders;
provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative shall not be required
to follow any such direction, and shall be under no obligation to take any
action in its capacity as the Stockholder Representative based upon any such
direction. Each Stockholder hereby severally, for itself only and not jointly
and severally, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives (collectively, the " _Stockholder
Representative Group_ ") against all of its reasonable losses, liabilities,
costs or expenses or damages incurred by the Stockholder Representative Group
in connection with, or arising out of, any actions taken or omitted to be
taken in the Stockholder Representatives capacity as the Stockholders
representative hereunder (except for those arising out of the Stockholder
Representatives fraud), including the costs of responding to indemnity claims
or from assuming the defense of third party claims. The Stockholder
Representative (for the Stockholder Representative Group) shall be entitled
to full reimbursement from the Stockholders for all expenses, disbursements
and advances (including fees and disbursements of its counsel, experts and
other agents and consultants) incurred by the Stockholder Representative in
such capacity (or any of its officers, directors, employees, agents or
representatives in connection therewith), and to full indemnification by the
Stockholders against any loss, liability, cost or expense arising out of
actions taken or omitted to be taken in its capacity as the Stockholder
Representative (except for those arising out of the Stockholder
Representatives fraud), including. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Stockholder Representative shall have the power and
authority to set aside and retain funds otherwise payable to the Stockholders
into a separate account to satisfy any obligations of the Stockholders
(including any obligations relating to indemnity claims). The relationship
created herein is not to 

 



70  be construed as a joint venture or any form of partnership between or among
the Stockholder Representative or any Stockholder for any purpose of U.S.
federal or state law, including federal or state Tax purposes. Neither the
Stockholder Representative nor any other member of the Stockholder
Representative Group owes any fiduciary or other duty to any Stockholder.

 

(d) _Exculpation_. The Stockholder Representative shall not have by reason of
this Agreement a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Stockholder, except
in respect of amounts received on behalf of such Stockholder. The Stockholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any action taken or
omitted by it or any agent employed by it hereunder or under any
other document entered into in connection herewith, (except as arising out of
the Stockholder Representatives fraud). The Stockholder Representative shall
not be liable to the Stockholders for any apportionment or distribution of
payments made by the Stockholder Representative in good faith, and if any
such apportionment or distribution is subsequently determined to have been
made in error the sole recourse of any Stockholder to whom payment was due,
but not made, shall be to recover from other Stockholders any payment in
excess of the amount to which they are determined to have been entitled. The
Stockholder Representative shall not be required to make any inquiry
concerning either the performance or observance of any of the
terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement. Neither the Stockholder
Representative nor any agent employed by it shall incur any liability to any
Stockholder by virtue of the failure of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby or relating to the performance of any duties hereunder
(except as arising out of the Stockholder Representatives fraud).
